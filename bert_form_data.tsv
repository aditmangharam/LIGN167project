57	4	a	i don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then i might . . . i don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist . i like to do illustrations . um . . . mostly watercolor . a few oil pencil . um , jim thinks they're good . 
58	4	a	dunder mifflin . this is pam .

65	1	a	you can't do that . 
66	2	a	why not ? 
67	1	a	safety violation . i could fall and pierce an organ . 
68	2	a	 we'll see . this is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me . 
69	1	a	downsizing ? 
70	1	a	downsizing ? i have no problem with that . i have been recommending downsizing since i first got here . i even brought it up in my interview . i say , bring it on . 
71	4	a	you just still have these messages from yesterday . 
72	3	a	relax . everything's under control . uh , yeah . yeah . that's important . right . oh this is so important , i should run to answer it . 
73	4	a	what ? 
74	3	a	come on . six-million dollar man ! steve austin ! actually , that would be a good salary for me , don't you think ? six million dollars ? memo to jan . i deserve a raise . 
75	4	a	don't we all ? 
76	3	a	i'm sorry ? 
77	4	a	nothing . 
78	3	a	if you're unhappy with your compensation , maybe you should take it up with hr . ok . not today , ok ? pam , just be professional . 
79	3	a	i think i'm a role model here . i think i garner people's respect . attention all dunder mifflin employees , please . we have a meeting in the conference room , asap . 
80	3	a	people i respect , heroes of mine , would be bob hope . . . abraham lincoln , definitely . bono . and probably god would be the fourth one . and i just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words . it's really incalculable . 
81	3	a	now i know there's some rumors out there and i just kind of want to set the record straight . 
82	1	a	i'm assistant regional manager . i should know first . 
83	3	a	assistant to the regional manager . 
84	1	a	ok , um , can you just tell me please ? just tell me quietly . can you whisper it in my ear ? 
85	3	a	i'm about to tell everybody . i'm just about to tell everybody . 
86	1	a	please , ok ? do you want me to tell 'em ? 
87	3	a	you don't know what it is . 
88	1	a	ok . you tell 'em . with my permission . permission granted . 
89	3	a	i don't need your permission . 
90	1	a	go ahead . 
91	3	a	corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me . and jan is thinking about downsizing either the stamford branch or this branch . 
92	3	a	not gonna happen . 
93	3	a	it won't be out of my hands stanley , ok . i promise you that . 
94	1	a	on his mother's grave . 
95	3	a	no . 
96	3	a	well , yeah , it is a promise . and frankly , i'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it . 
97	3	a	i know . hold on a second . i think pam wanted to say something . pam , you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then . 
98	4	a	i was in the meeting with jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe . 
99	3	a	well , pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings . 
100	1	a	pam , information is power . 
101	3	a	no , stanley . no , you did not see me in there with her . i said if corporate wants to come in here and interfere , then they're gonna have to go through me . right ? you can go mess with josh's people , but i'm the head of this family , and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin . 
102	2	a	if i left , what would i do with all this useless information in my head ? you know ? tonnage price of manila folders ? um , pam's favorite flavor of yogurt , which is mixed berry . 
103	4	a	jim said mixed berries ? well , yeah , he's on to me . um . . . 
104	3	a	watch out for this guy . dwight schrute in the building . this is ryan , the new temp . 
105	3	a	introduce yourself . be polite . 
106	1	a	dwight schrute , assistant regional manager . 
107	3	a	assistant to the regional manager . so , uh , dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything . 
108	1	a	uh . . . yeah i got a '78 280z . bought it for $1 , 200 . fixed it up . it's now worth three grand .

114	1	a	that's real professional thanks . that's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either jim . 
115	1	a	it's ok here , but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed . i'm a volunteer sheriff's deputy on the weekends . and you cannot screw around there . that's sort of one of the rules . 
116	3	a	what is that ? 
117	1	a	that is my stapler . 
118	3	a	no , no , no . do not take it out . you have to eat it out of there , because there are starving people in the world which i hate , and it is a waste of that kind of food . 
119	1	a	ok you know what , you can be a witness . can you reprimand him ? 
120	2	a	how do you know it was me ? 
121	1	a	it's always you . are you going to discipline him or not ? 
122	3	a	discipline . kinky ! all right , here's the deal you guys . the thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop . 
123	1	a	yeah . 
124	3	a	and yeah , jim this is the time to stop putting dwight's personal effects into jell-o . 
125	2	a	ok . dwight , i'm sorry , because i have always been your biggest flan . 
126	3	a	 nice . that's the way it is around here . it just kind of goes round and round . 
127	3	a	hey ! yes ! new guy ! he scores . 
128	1	a	ok , that's great . i guess what i'm most concerned with is damage to company property . that's all . 
129	3	a	pudding . pudding . . . i'm trying to think of another dessert to do . 
130	2	a	do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink ?

208	3	a	you know what ? this is a color-free-zone here . stanley , i don't look at you as another race . 
209	3	a	exactly , were not . . . 
210	3	a	with tolerance . 
211	3	a	ignorance . 
212	3	a	let's celebrate . 
213	3	a	celebrate good times . come on ! let's celebrate diversity . right ? 
214	3	a	you know what ? here's what we're going to do . why don't we go around and everybody . . . everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually . i will go last . go . 
215	1	a	i have two . white and indian . 
216	3	a	yes . 
217	3	a	ok . 
218	1	a	a few of the ground rules ? 
219	3	a	hey , hey why don't you run it by me and i'll run it by him . 
220	1	a	ok , can we steer away from gay people ? 
221	1	a	i'm sorry . it's an orientation . it's not a race . plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays , so . . . paradox . 
222	1	a	i figured it would save time . 
223	3	a	ok . why don't we just defer to mr . . . 
224	3	a	ah . oh , right ! ok . first test . i will not call you that . 
225	3	a	how come chris rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then i go and do the exact same routine , same comedic timing , and people file a complaint to corporate ? is it because i'm white and chris is black ? 
226	3	a	i will play the chris rock guy . i would like to see someone else pull this off . 
227	3	a	ok , i will play guy listening . 
228	3	a	ok . 
229	3	a	kevin is a great guy . he's a great accountant . he is not much of an entertainer . 
230	3	a	ok . i'm sorry . i'm sorry . he's ruin . . . he's butchering it . could you just let me . . . every time . . . every time black people want to have a good time , some ignant ass . . . i take care of my kid ! 
231	3	a	 they always want credit for something they supposed to do ! 
232	3	a	 what you want a cookie ? 
233	1	a	excuse me , i'm sorry , but that's not all it takes to be a hero . 
234	1	a	a hero kills people , people that wish him harm . 
235	1	a	a hero is part-human and part-supernatural . a hero is born out of a childhood trauma , or out of a disaster that must be avenged . 
236	1	a	we all have a hero in our heart . 
237	3	a	 i don't think i can sign this . 
238	3	a	well , ok , it says here that i learned something and i knew all this stuff already , so . . . i know , i could sign something that says that i taught something , or that i helped you teach something , so . . . pam ! where is she ? pam , could we change something on this ? 
239	3	a	sure . 
240	3	a	here's the thing . this office , i think this is very advanced in terms of . . . racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to . that's probably throwing you off a little bit . 
241	3	a	ok , well i know . you told me that several times . 
242	3	a	ok . 
243	3	a	well , here i am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training . and you don't . 
244	3	a	i won't . 
245	3	a	yeah , yeah . 
246	3	a	i regret my actions . i regret offending my coworkers . i pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty , empathy , respect and open-mindedness . . . ' open-mindedness , is that even a word ? ' . . . into the workplace . in this way , i can truly be a hero . signed , daffy duck . ' he's going to lose it when he reads that . 
247	2	a	yeah , hi . is mr . decker around ? oh , well , could you just have him call me after lunch ? thank you . 
248	3	a	all right ? everybody pretty ? come on . here we go . it's time . let's do some good .

254	3	a	two fifteenths . 
255	3	a	well , you know what , it's kind of hard for me to talk about it . their suffering . so who else ? let's get this popping . come on . who's going ? who's going ? let's go here . oscar , right here . you're on . 
256	3	a	oh , yeah . . . 
257	3	a	wow . 
258	3	a	wow . that is . . . that is a great story . that's the american dream right there , right ? 
259	3	a	um , let me ask you , is there a term besides mexican that you prefer ? something less offensive ? 
260	3	a	well , it has certain connotations . 
261	3	a	like . . . i don't . . . i don't know . 
262	3	a	no . now , remember that honesty . . . 
263	3	a	 . . . empathy , respect . . . jim ! jim ! 
264	2	a	hello ? hello ? 
265	3	a	why ? because martin luther king is a hero of mine . there's this great chris rock bit about how streets named after martin luther king tend to be more violent . i'm not going to do it but it's . . . 
266	3	a	oh this is a good one . 
267	4	a	um , hi . how are you ?

280	4	a	ok . if i have to do this , based on stereotypes that are totally untrue , that i do not agree with , you would maybe not be a very good driver .

339	3	a	there's a decision that needs to be made , and i'm having an unbelievably a busy day . so i'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers . 
340	2	a	gosh . 
341	3	a	yeah ! 
342	2	a	that is a great offer . thank you . i really think i should be concentrating on sales . 
343	3	a	really ? 
344	2	a	yeah . i just don't think this is the kind of task , that i . . . am going to do . you know who would be great for this ? 
345	2	a	any time michael asks me to do anything , i just tell him that dwight should do it . 
346	1	a	yes . i can do it . i'm your man . 
347	2	a	right now , this is just a job . if i advance any higher in this company then this would be my career . and uh , well , if this were my career , i'd have to throw myself in front of a train . 
348	1	a	ok , first , let's go over some parameters . how many people can i fire ? 
349	3	a	ah , none . you're picking a health care plan . 
350	1	a	ok , we'll table that for the time being . two , i'll need an office . i think the conference room should be fine . 
351	3	a	you can use the conference room as a temporary workspace . 
352	1	a	 yes , i have an office . bigger than his . 
353	3	a	nope , you cannot use it . 
354	1	a	ok , i take it back , it's a workspace . 
355	3	a	temporary workspace . you can use it . 
356	1	a	thank you . 
357	3	a	if dwight fails , then that is strike two , and good for me for , ah , for giving him a second chance . and if he succeeds , then , you know , no one will be prouder than i am . i groomed him . i made him what he is today . unless he fails , and we've talked about that already . 
358	1	a	what did i do ? i did my job . i slashed benefits to the bone . i saved this company money . was i too harsh ? maybe . i don't believe in coddling people . 
359	1	a	in the wild , there is no health care . in the wild , health care is , 'ow , i hurt my leg . i can't run . a lion eats me and i'm dead . ' well , i'm not dead . i'm the lion . you're dead .

373	2	a	it says 'workspace' . 
374	1	a	same thing . 
375	2	a	if it's the same thing , then why did you write 'workspace' ? 
376	1	a	just knock , please ? as a sign of respect for your superior . 
377	2	a	you are not my superior . 
378	1	a	oh gee , then why do i have an office ? 
379	2	a	i thought it was a workspace ? 
380	4	a	ok . dwight . are you really in charge of picking the health care plan ? 
381	1	a	yes . and my decision in final . 
382	4	a	this is a ridiculously awful plan . because you cut everything . 
383	1	a	aww , times are tough , pam . deal with it . 
384	2	a	you cut more than you had to , didn't you ? 
385	1	a	sure . 
386	2	a	well , why did you do that ? you work here , don't you want good insurance ? 
387	1	a	don't need it . never been sick . perfect immune system .

389	1	a	i don't need them . superior genes . i'm a schrute . and superior brain power . through concentration , i can raise and lower my cholesterol at will . 
390	4	a	why would you want to raise your cholesterol ?

397	4	a	michael , he made huge cuts . 
398	3	a	cuts ? what ? wow , dwight , did you make cuts ? 
399	1	a	yeah , you said . . . 
400	3	a	no , no , no , you know what ? i said nothing specific because i was so busy . why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them ? ok ?

404	1	a	ok , everyone . gather round . step forward . it has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan . so what i'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and i'll see what i can do . 
405	2	a	ok , you know what dwight ? we can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential . 
406	1	a	ok , well , i didn't say to write your name down , did i ? fill it out , leave it anonymous . or , don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered . sound fair ? good . i'll be in my office . 
407	2	a	workspace . 
408	3	a	you know what ? come with me . we are going on a little mission . operation surprise . 
409	4	a	where are you going ? 
410	3	a	um , headed out . part of my busy day , you know . meetings . couldn't find the knob . 
411	3	a	so , basically , i want to do something nice for my employees . atlantic city , ok ? they have this thing where they send a bus , right , for free . picks everybody up , you head down there , get to the hotel , room is comped , they give you a pile of chips , and your food , everything just kind of all-inclusive , free kind of weekend .

413	2	a	wait . what are you writing ? don't write ebola or mad cow disease . right ? 'cause i'm suffering from both . 
414	4	a	i'm inventing new diseases . 
415	2	a	oh , great . 
416	4	a	so , let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then , they drip down the back of my throat . what would you call that ? 
417	2	a	i thought you said you were inventing diseases ? that's spontaneous dental hydroplosion . 
418	4	a	nice . 
419	2	a	thank you . 
420	3	a	 calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend . um , trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost . and i was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride . 
421	3	a	its says here that it's a 300ft drop . 
422	3	a	so it's not a free fall ? 
423	3	a	uh , all right . well , once you get down into the mine , what . . . you got laser tag or something ? 
424	3	a	ok , so i don't know what the surprise is . am i worried ? no . no way . see , i thrive on this . this is my world . this is improv . this is whose line is it anyway ? 
425	1	a	damnit ! damnit jim ! 
426	1	a	all right , who did this ? i'm not mad . i just want to know who did it so i can punish them . 
427	2	a	what are you talking about ? 
428	1	a	uh , someone forged , uh , medical information and that is a felony . 
429	2	a	ok , whoa . 'cause that is a pretty intense accusation . how do you know that they're fake ?

434	2	a	no i didn't . 
435	1	a	i know it was you . fine . you know what ? i'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known . and until that time , there will be no health care coverage for any one ! 
436	2	a	killer nanorobots ? 
437	4	a	it's an epidemic . 
438	1	a	the problem , jim , is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need , because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff . 'count choculitis'
439	2	a	sounds tough . 
440	1	a	why did you write that down jim ? is it because you know i love count chocula ? 
441	2	a	do you ? 
442	1	a	i think you need to confess . . .

489	3	a	 oh , christ . 
490	1	a	i tried being rational , ok ? and what happened ? the employees went crazy , i got no help from corporate . that leaves me with no options . 
491	1	a	i'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions . when you hear yours read , please raise your hand to indicate that it is real . if you do not raise your hand , it will not be covered . 
492	1	a	you know what ? you have forfeited that privilege . i have tried to treat you all as adults , but obviously i am the only adult here . number one , inverted penis . 
493	1	a	i thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy ? 
494	1	a	ok , great . dermatitis . thank you angela . i'll make sure that's covered . ok , now . who wrote this , hysterical one ? anal fissures ? 
495	1	a	yeah , but no one here has it . 
496	3	a	well , what ? you could be referring to anything . 
497	4	a	why did you put dwight in charge of that ? he did a horrible job . 
498	3	a	uh , dwight ? did you raise benefits ? 
499	1	a	i most certainly did not . 
500	3	a	oh come on ! that's horrible ! aaah . . . thanks , dwight , for a crappy plan . ah , damn ! oh , mmm , i wish i had time to change it , but jan needs it by five , and . . . what time is it , what time is it ? ah , it's after five . oh , oh it's awful . so , well , ok . see you guys on monday . 
501	3	a	oh . . . yes . exactly . thank you angela , for reminding me . terrific . um , before i tell everybody what the big surprise is , would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is ?

504	3	a	 god , yeah . . . ah ! this . . . 
505	3	a	robin williams . oh , man , would i love to go head-to-head with him . oh ! that would be exciting . 'hi . i'm mork from ork . ' well , i'm bork from spork . nanoo , nanoo . jibelee , baloobaloo .

507	1	a	michael ! ? 
508	3	a	oh ! god . dwight , come on . . . 
509	1	a	i wanted to talk to you about the downsizing ? 
510	3	a	there's no downsizing . 
511	1	a	i , but if there were , i'd be protected as assistant regional manager ? 
512	3	a	assistant to the regional manager dwight . 
513	1	a	yeah , so i don't have to worry ? 
514	3	a	look , look , look . i talked to corporate , about protecting the sales staff . and they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing , okay ? 
515	3	a	but there's no downsizing , so just don't . . . 
516	1	a	bottom line . do i need to be worried ? 
517	3	a	mmm , mm , mm . maybe . 
518	1	a	it's a real shame , 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos . which puts me at a disadvantage , because i bring my own water to work . 
519	1	a	i didn't do it . what do you mean ? oh , the water cooler was brought over here for . . . maintenance . so what do you guys hear ? what's the scuttlebutt ? 
520	3	a	who is it ? who's the birthday ? 
521	4	a	um . . . actually , we don't have any staff birthdays coming up . 
522	3	a	next person on the . . . 
523	4	a	oh . 
524	3	a	 . . . calendar . 
525	4	a	okay , umm . . . that would be meredith .

527	4	a	but it's not until next month . 
528	3	a	um . . . uh , ok . well , great , well , you know , it'll be a surprise . 
529	4	a	you still want to have a party ? 
530	3	a	yeah , why not ? sure . go ahead , live a little . come on , pam . come on , shake it up . shake it up ! shake it up ! 
531	3	a	 brrrp ! uh , spock , are there any signs of life down there ? well , let me check captain . eeee . eeee . eeee . eeee . no , captain . no signs of life down here . just a wet blanket named pam . brr-rrrp . star trek . 
532	4	a	how about green ? 
533	4	a	this was tough . i suggested we flip a coin . but angela said she doesn't like to gamble . of course by saying that she was gambling that i wouldn't smack her . 
534	3	a	these are my party-planning beeyatches . pulled off an amazing '80s party last year . off the hook ! 
535	3	a	so i was thinking , if you haven't already got a cake , um , maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from baskin-robbins . those are very good . very delicious . 
536	3	a	she's not the only one that's going to be eating it , right ? i think everybody likes ice-cream cake . it's not , uh , it's not just about her , so . . . 
537	4	a	it is . . . her birthday . 
538	3	a	mint chocolate chip ! that'd be good , how about some , mint chocolate chip ? 
539	1	a	hey , so listen , i was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and i formed an alliance . 'cause of the downsizing ? i think an alliance might be a good idea , you know . help each other out . 
540	1	a	do you want to form , an alliance , with me ? 
541	2	a	absolutely , i do . 
542	1	a	good , good . excellent , ok . now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected . . . 
543	2	a	at that moment , i was so happy . i mean , everything dwight does annoys me . 
544	1	a	did you get your tickets ? 
545	2	a	to what ? 
546	1	a	the gun show . 
547	2	a	and i spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him , but only in ways that could get me arrested . and then here he comes and he says 'no , jim , here's a way . '
548	1	a	there's one other thing and this is important . let's keep this alliance totally a secret . don't tell anyone . 
549	4	a	an alliance ? 
550	2	a	oh yeah . 
551	4	a	what does that even mean ? 
552	2	a	i think it has something to do with survivor , but i'm not sure . 
553	2	a	um , i know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort , underground . 
554	1	a	jim ! hey . hi , pam . listen , could i talk to you a second about the . . . paper products ?

650	3	a	is oscar around ? 
651	3	a	i just thought it was kind of a flat , you know . . . 25 dollar , one-time donation . i didn't think it was per mile kinda deal . you know , so . . . 
652	3	a	i know . . . 
653	3	a	right . got it . yes . so it does . um . . . 
654	3	a	no , no , no , no , no . that wasn't what i wasn't , that wasn't . . . no . it-it-it's not about the money . it's just . . . it . . . it's the ethics of the thing , oscar . how's your nephew ? is he in good shape ?

671	3	a	i want it to be like . . . 'hey , who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives ? ' 'um , well , i don't , i don't know . it was anonymous . ' 'well , guess what , that was michael scott . ' 'but it was anonymous , how do you know ? ' 'because i'm him . '

1300	2	a	the weird part about this whole deal this that michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational . i mean , he puts more effort and time and commitment into the dundies than anything else he does all year . which is probably why this branch will be downsized . 
1301	1	a	angela , it's simple . just tell me what the bathroom wall says . 
1302	1	a	i'm not asking what you do in there . i just want to know what's written about michael . 
1303	1	a	okay , i'll talk . you nod if i get it right . does it have to do with his butt or his wiener ? 
1304	3	a	well , what should i do , guys ? seriously , do you want me to just cancel the dundies ? 
1305	3	a	ping ? everybody loves ping . he's my most popular character . 
1306	3	a	really ? well , he is based on the chinese delivery guy that i have , who talks exactly like that , so , i think you should take it up with him instead of me . 
1307	3	a	 well , neither of you are chinese , so what . . . why do you care ?

1351	4	a	you are ? 
1352	4	a	my mom is coming in to visit . and she lives like two hours away . and she doesn't have a cell phone . . . which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day . and i keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in . 
1353	4	a	i've decided to show her around . she really wants to meet everybody . 
1354	2	a	oh yeah ?

1362	3	a	yes , toby ? 
1363	3	a	um . . . literally two seconds ? 
1364	3	a	toby is in hr which technically means he works for corporate . so he's really not a part of our family . also he's divorced so he's really not a part of his family . 
1365	3	a	no , no , toby . no . 
1366	3	a	it is a big deal . it's a big deal ! what are we supposed to do ? scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day ? i mean , come on ! 
1367	3	a	what ? 
1368	3	a	no ! 
1369	3	a	what ? he ! no ! okay , what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us ? to not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes ? 
1370	3	a	there is no such thing as an appropriate joke . that's why it's a joke . 
1371	3	a	everyone ! hello ! everyone . hi ! sorry to interrupt . i know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption . but toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day . so , take it away . 
1372	3	a	i wish you luck , toby . i really do . but you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and i just can't wait to see how you handle it . 
1373	3	a	a guy goes to a five dollar . . . lady of the night and he gets crabs . so , the next day he goes back to complain . and the woman says 'hey . it was only five dollars . what did you expect ? lobster ? ' this is what's at stake . 
1374	3	a	um , yeah , no , well . . . i mean better . better than that . the type of stuff you guys tell all day . 
1375	3	a	alright , alright . well , yeah , but , you know . . . a joke but not necessarily at my expense . 
1376	3	a	oooh , okay . that was still about me .

1384	4	a	thanks , kevin . 
1385	4	a	usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke . 
1386	4	a	she's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her . 
1387	4	a	thank you . 
1388	3	a	hi , is it over ?

1390	3	a	i know , i know . it's good . it is not over . it is not over til it's over . 
1391	3	a	did he tell you everything ? obviously , he didn't because you all still look relatively happy . albeit bored . do you realize what we're losing ? seriously ? 
1392	3	a	exactly ! mmwwah ! can we afford to lose email forwards ? do we want that ? 
1393	3	a	give me a break . umm . . . stanley , how about that hot picture you have by your desk ? centerfold in the catholic schoolgirl's outfit ? i mean , it is hot , it is sexy , and it turns him on . and i will admit , best part of my morning is staring at it . but what ? are we just going to take it away ? 
1394	3	a	i think the old honor system was just fine . for example , i have never slept with an employee . and , believe me , i could have . 
1395	1	a	yeah , meredith .

1417	3	a	so you are the lawyer , mr . o'malley ? i know a lot of lawyer jokes . 
1418	3	a	well , it's probably because you don't get 'em . 
1419	3	a	when i said before that i was king of forwards , you got to understand that i don't come up with this stuff . i just forward it along . you wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another . 
1420	3	a	the problem is that i am the boss and apparently i can't say anything . 
1421	3	a	where's the line ? where's the line , jan . 
1422	3	a	no , i've seen the video . 
1423	3	a	no , i didn't . huh , what ?

1428	3	a	 come on . 
1429	3	a	mwah !

1431	3	a	it's . . . that's . . . 
1432	3	a	okay . hello . jan . mr . o'malley . this is my lawyer , james p . albiny . 
1433	3	a	i believe you may recognize his face from the billboards . he specializes in free speech issues . 
1434	3	a	this guy does it all . 
1435	3	a	what ? 
1436	3	a	so i'm not in trouble ? 
1437	3	a	i am so used to being the bad boy . i am so used to fighting corporate that i forget that i am corporate . upper management . they hooked me up with an attorney . to protect me . you can't be too careful about what you say . mo' money , mo' problems . 
1438	3	a	okay . well , let's get you out of here , james . um . . . i think we're under an hour still , so . . . 
1439	3	a	i know . we'll talk about it later . thanks for coming in . 
1440	4	a	 oh my god ! 
1441	4	a	hello ! 
1442	4	a	i love my mom . okay . that's probably really the most obvious statement ever . 
1443	4	a	yeah . i'm in charge of this whole area . 
1444	4	a	this is where i used to keep my computer . 
1445	4	a	but then i moved it . 
1446	4	a	yeah , yeah , but i uh . . . i switched stuff around because i actually needed like more room for organization . so . . . 
1447	4	a	so this is like , um , an organization station . . . 
1448	4	a	hey ! 
1449	4	a	well , you know . . . actually , i kind of need to stall a bit . but , it's okay , because i am very used to killing time . 
1450	4	a	mom ! 
1451	4	a	no . 
1452	4	a	ten minutes . 
1453	4	a	then we can go to dinner . 
1454	3	a	no . no , no , no . that crosses the line . 
1455	3	a	not you . kevin . just unwarranted . hostile work environment , kevin . 
1456	3	a	no . you said it . he pointed . a point is not a say . look . kevin , we are a family here and phyllis is a valued member of that family . like a grandmother . 
1457	3	a	i don't know about that . 
1458	3	a	well , i have a late birthday and usually september's a cut-off point . you know what ? you just crossed the line . okay ? there's a line and you went over it . and you must be punished . so go to your corner . 
1459	3	a	yes , your corner . go . 
1460	3	a	mmmhmmm . 
1461	3	a	they didn't get to me . i got to them . i am still the same old michael scott . new and improved . you know what ? i love phyllis . you know what else ? i think she is gorgeous . i think she is incredibly , incredibly attractive person . c'mere , c'mere , c'mon ! come on ! come on . 
1462	3	a	oooh ! 
1463	3	a	i'm not worried . 
1464	3	a	you know what ? the only thing i'm worried about . . . is getting a boner . good work today , everybody . 
1465	3	a	times have changed a little . and even though we're still a family here at dunder-mifflin , families grow . and at some point , the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore . i am upper management . and it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with pam . as much as i might want to . 
1466	4	a	he said what ? 
1467	3	a	i'm an early bird , and i'm a night owl . so i'm wise , and i have worms . oh , breakfast . 
1468	3	a	yummy , yummy . thank you , ryan . 
1469	3	a	um . the sausage , egg , and cheese biscuit . but thank you . and why don't you take a couple hours . the office is yours . 'home alone , ' 'risky business . ' take your pants off , run around . whatever you gotta do . 
1470	3	a	ok . healthier . gotta watch those carbs . 
1471	3	a	today , i , michael scott , am becoming a homeowner . investing in real estate . 
1472	1	a	diversifying . smart . 
1473	3	a	yes it is . yes it is . it is very important to own property . back in olden days , they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you . 
1474	1	a	and it worked . they should bring the stocks back . people'd obey the law , there'd be less troublemakers . 
1475	3	a	maybe . 
1476	4	a	every so often , jim dies of boredom . i think today it was the expense reports that did him in . and our deal is that , it's up to me to revive him . 
1477	4	a	you see dwight's coffee mug ? 
1478	2	a	mm-hmm . 
1479	4	a	sometimes when he's not here , i try to throw stuff in it . 
1480	2	a	no way . let's do this oh . 
1481	4	a	here . 
1482	2	a	wind .

1550	3	a	yeah , small . i'm buying it and i'm not renting it . so , it's still an upgrade . he doesn't know anything about property ownership . kind of an idiot . um . 
1551	1	a	actually , i do own property . my grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm . i run it with my cousin , mose . we sell beets to local stores and restaurants . it's a nice little farm . sometimes teenagers use it for sex . 
1552	1	a	actually , no . we have a couple of questions , about the neighborhood . 
1553	3	a	oh . good . that's good . it's good to be accommodating of that . 
1554	1	a	let's go check out the master bedroom . 
1555	2	a	stanley . just played dunder ball with toby . what about you , you got any games ? 
1556	2	a	fair enough . 
1557	3	a	this , my friends , is the master bedroom . check out the cathedral ceilings . those are like seventeen feet high . we have cable readiness . right there . i am going to totally pimp this place out . i am going to put a surround sound system . i am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall . 
1558	1	a	oh . terrible idea . 
1559	3	a	i'm putting my bed right over here . 
1560	1	a	no , no , no , no , no . this is a shared wall . neighbor throws his wife into the wall , plasma screen hits the floor . totally smashed . 
1561	3	a	well , then i will get a warrantee . 
1562	1	a	warrantees don't cover it , plus they're a rip-off . 
1563	3	a	well then i won't get a warrantee . 
1564	1	a	shh shh . 
1565	3	a	so that's the problem , is solved . what ?

1567	2	a	 this scented candle . . . andle . . . andle . which i found in the men's bathroom . . . room . . . room . represents the eternal burning of competition . or something . 
1568	2	a	yes it does . yes it does my friend . ok , we will be competing for gold , silver and bronze yogurt lids . 
1569	4	a	now the bronze are really blue , and they're also the back side of the gold , so no flipping . k ? honor system . 
1570	2	a	let the games begin . 
1571	1	a	what kind of mortgage did you get ?

1577	3	a	alright . 
1578	1	a	forget about retiring when you're 65 . hey , i've got an idea . you know that extra bedroom ? if the whole girlfriend thing never happens , that's where the nurse can live . 
1579	3	a	ok . alright . oh boy . 
1580	1	a	well , this is it .

1584	1	a	we'll be here waiting for you . 
1585	3	a	oh , man . 
1586	1	a	a thirty year mortgage at michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin . if i were buying my coffin , i would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people . 
1587	3	a	uh . 
1588	2	a	you have what is the national sport of icelandic paper companies . and i'm blanking on the name , can you help me out pam ?

1591	4	a	in english , box of paper snowshoe racing . 
1592	2	a	fair enough , but i like flonkerton . 
1593	4	a	the thing about jim , is when he's excited about something , like the office olympics , he gets really into it and he does a really great job . but the problem with jim is that he works here , so that hardly ever happens . 
1594	2	a	so , who will be challenging kevin in flonkerton ? anyone ?

1598	3	a	where are all the hot people ? i was told that there would be all these attractive singles . 
1599	3	a	as far as i can tell , i'm the best-looking person here . 
1600	3	a	there's a basic principle in real estate , that you should never be the best-looking person in the development . it's just sorta common sense , because if you are , then you've no place to go but down . 
1601	3	a	no , no , no . 
1602	3	a	i am not going to rent the third bedroom . i want a price reduction or i am a-walkin .

1617	3	a	why did i do it ? because i believe in rewarding people for their efforts . ah . i rewarded dwight with the room , and he is rewarding me back , ah , with $500 plus utilities . 
1618	1	a	i don't even know what to say .

1970	3	a	 what ? there was someone left off that list ? who ?

1981	1	a	tell him , not dwight . 
1982	3	a	that is not a very nice thing to say about him .

1984	3	a	are you kidding ? 
1985	1	a	quiet , you . 
1986	3	a	i agree . he'd land on his feet .

1989	4	a	 . . . what ? 
1990	4	a	i made brownies .

2001	1	a	would i ever leave this company ? look , i'm all about loyalty . in fact , i feel like part of what i'm getting paid for here is my loyalty . but , if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly , i'm going wherever they value loyalty the most . 
2002	4	a	jim is really talented . and he should be the one who's getting a better job offer . like , for real . 
2003	4	a	don't take this the wrong way , but . . . you should go for that job . 
2004	2	a	um . . . it's in maryland . 
2005	4	a	yeah , but i mean , look at the salary . and it's definitely a step up . and a challenge .

2007	4	a	jim . . . 
2008	1	a	this is called leveraging an offer . michael , can i talk to you for a moment ?

2011	3	a	fantastic ! 
2012	1	a	and i turned it down . 
2013	3	a	what ? ! that would've solved all my problems . 
2014	1	a	out of loyalty to this company . . . 
2015	3	a	oh , you idiot . 
2016	1	a	 . . . so i was hoping to be made assistant regional manager officially . 
2017	3	a	if you left , i wouldn't have to fire anybody . 
2018	1	a	but then you wouldn't have me here . 
2019	3	a	big deal . oh , it would've worked out so well . can you get it back ? 
2020	1	a	it's in maryland .

2037	3	a	yes , that's a good idea . 
2038	2	a	alright . excuse me . i'm really sorry , but i have to let you go . and it's purely budgetary . it's not personal . . .

2128	1	a	i am a practitioner of goju ru karate , here in scranton . my sensei , ira , recently promoted me to purple belt , and gave me the duties of a sempai . not that a lot of people here in america know what a sempai is , but it is equally as respected as a sensei . 
2129	4	a	i don't really have any control over that stanley . 
2130	3	a	 i don't want to work , i just want to bang on this mug all day . 
2131	3	a	uhh , yes , i did , here's the dizzle . i have a very top secret mission for you . i want you to update all the emergency contact information .

2148	4	a	i am just following the website . 
2149	2	a	well , at least i don't have cavities .

2153	3	a	 this is mike tyson . 
2154	2	a	hey , dwight . as sempai , do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist ? 
2155	1	a	impossible . the way they're programmed . . . you're mocking me . 
2156	2	a	no i'm not . 
2157	1	a	look , i'm going to offer you a little piece of advice . i'm not afraid to make an example out of you . 
2158	2	a	oh , that's not advice . what advice sounds like is this: umm , don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it . 
2159	1	a	ok , give that back to me . 
2160	2	a	ok , say please . 
2161	1	a	no . that is not a toy . 
2162	2	a	please ? 
2163	1	a	please ? 
2164	2	a	good , and it absolutely is a toy . arigatou . 
2165	1	a	arigatou . this is not a toy . this is a message to the entire office so they can see that i am capable of physically dominating them . 
2166	3	a	and this is more a ying-yang thing . the 'michael' all cursive , the 'scott' all caps . left brain , right brain . or , duality of man . 
2167	4	a	could you practice on the forms ? 
2168	1	a	no women or children , unless provoked . 
2169	2	a	ok , roy ? 
2170	1	a	warehouse guy . doesn't count . 
2171	2	a	ok . michael ? could you beat up michael ? 
2172	3	a	yeah , yeah , i don't think that would happen . 
2173	1	a	because we're friends . 
2174	3	a	because i would kick his ass . 
2175	2	a	well , dwight's a purple belt , so . . . 
2176	3	a	so ? i've beaten up black belts . 
2177	2	a	uh , how did you know they were black belts ? 
2178	3	a	they told me . after . you see , i used to run with a very tough crowd . street fighter types . real , real bad people , i'm just lucky i got out . 
2179	3	a	and after that , nobody ever messed with the 'damn rascals' ever again . 
2180	2	a	sounds tough . when you're a jet , you're a jet all the way , right ? 
2181	3	a	you were a jet ? 
2182	3	a	yes , in theory , i have . i just need to cross some t's and dot some i's . alright , i'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me . hoo-hah . oh , wow , sleeper hold . that's my rebuttal . shhh . hoo . you are the weakest link . 
2183	1	a	argggg ! 
2184	3	a	i'm friends with everybody in this office . we're all best friends - i love everybody here . but sometimes your best friends start coming into work late , and start having dentist appointments that aren't dentist appointments . and that's when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up . 
2185	3	a	just hit me . you'll see . 
2186	2	a	i can't . i just got a manicure . 
2187	3	a	oh , queer . . . eye . queer eye . that's a good show . important show . go ahead . do it . 
2188	2	a	just have dwight punch you . 
2189	3	a	oh yeah , that would be kind of worthless because i know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass . 
2190	2	a	you know a ton of fourteen year old girls ? 
2191	1	a	what belt are they ? 
2192	3	a	look , dwight is a wuss . when we rented 'armageddon' . . . 
2193	1	a	no ! 
2194	3	a	 . . . he cried at the end of it . he did . 
2195	1	a	michael , i told you , it was because it was new year's eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight . 
2196	3	a	oh , bruce willis . are they going to leave him on the asteroid ? 
2197	1	a	ok , i'll punch you . 
2198	3	a	ok , here we go . alright , come on . 
2199	1	a	kiyah ! 
2200	3	a	fuuuaaaahhhhh . . . oohhhhh ! 
2201	1	a	did i want to harm michael ? the one man i've been hired to protect ? no , i did not . 
2202	2	a	are you ok ? are you sure you are alright ? 
2203	3	a	yeah . thank you . 
2204	1	a	i come from a long line of fighters . my maternal grandfather was the toughest guy i ever knew . world war ii veteran . killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an allied prison camp . my father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life . different kind of fight . 
2205	2	a	ok , he has to be stopped . please , please , please , please , just ask michael . 
2206	4	a	i don't know . 
2207	2	a	ok , i'll buy you a bag of chips . 
2208	4	a	french onion ? 
2209	2	a	obviously . 
2210	4	a	ok . 
2211	2	a	yes . 
2212	1	a	 take this pen and stab me with it . 
2213	3	a	 go away . 
2214	4	a	i just have a quick question . 
2215	3	a	i haven't signed them , ok ? 
2216	4	a	no , it's not that . um , i was just wondering , since i'm probably going to have to stay late , could you ask dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car ? 
2217	3	a	come in . um , pam , i hate to break this to you but dwight can't stop you from being mugged . he's just not tough enough . 
2218	4	a	he's a purple belt . that's really high . 
2219	3	a	oh , i could beat up dwight . that's ridiculous . i could murder him . 
2220	4	a	it's just out there , you . . . 
2221	3	a	oh , so that's what they are saying ? 
2222	4	a	yeah . 
2223	3	a	ok , alright , where is dwight ? 
2224	2	a	uh , kitchen . 
2225	3	a	ok . 
2226	1	a	good . 
2227	1	a	now watch , let me take you from behind . 
2228	3	a	watch out kelly , he might sucker punch you . 
2229	1	a	i didn't sucker punch you , michael . 
2230	3	a	no , really ? 
2231	1	a	in case you remember , i was defending my honor . . . like a samurai . 
2232	3	a	really ? well , the offer , dwight , was for one punch which i absorbed . i had no idea that there would be a second punch . so , catch-22 . 
2233	1	a	ok , fine . tit for tit . give it your best shot . two punches . go ! 
2234	3	a	look , if we were in a bar right now , there would be two punches: me punching you and you hitting the floor . 
2235	1	a	no , i would block your first punch rendering it ineffective . 
2236	3	a	really ? 
2237	1	a	yeah . 
2238	3	a	you know what ? you're just lucky that we are at work right now . 
2239	2	a	ooh , what about , uh , dwight's dojo ? 
2240	3	a	no , they must have class . 
2241	1	a	no , it's free during the day . it's fine . 
2242	3	a	look . . . 
2243	1	a	i've got the key . 
2244	3	a	hey , toby . 
2245	3	a	i've got an idea: why don't you leave right now . why don't you walk away from the room , 'kay ? fine . we'll go at lunch . pam , make an announcement . figure out carpools . 
2246	2	a	um , well , we are all getting excited to see this fight . the albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing , but michael , he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight dwight . fight . . . fight , fight , fight , fight , fight , fight , i'm coming , fight . . . 
2247	3	a	i recognize that . that is japanese for california roll . 
2248	3	a	i think it is . a guy told me about that . 
2249	3	a	oh . 
2250	2	a	 wow , that is really interesting . 
2251	4	a	what ? 
2252	2	a	your love line- i'm just kidding . i can't see anything . 
2253	4	a	well , look closer .

2507	3	a	ok . yeah , what , what ?

2511	3	a	ah , why , that's great news ? that , that , then why would , why would i not like that ? 
2512	4	a	um , just cause , that , you work together , and it might be awkward .

2522	1	a	uh , that is so stupid . what if he gives it to you ?

2568	3	a	yep , right after you . apres-vous . no calls . 
2569	3	a	alright . 
2570	3	a	it's nice to see you . 
2571	3	a	really ? 
2572	3	a	oh , well . 
2573	3	a	alright . 
2574	3	a	yep . 
2575	3	a	absolutely . 
2576	3	a	this is a business question . it's nothing personal , i promise . 
2577	3	a	are you wearing a new perfume today ? 
2578	3	a	well , you're wearing it at the office . and it , i'm sorry , but no offense , but it's really sexy . 
2579	4	a	hey , jim . 
2580	2	a	hey , how's it goin' ? 
2581	4	a	oh my god , did you see 'the apprentice' last night ? 
2582	2	a	course , it's on every thursday night , so how could i miss it ? 
2583	4	a	can you believe who trump fired ? 
2584	2	a	no , that was unbelievable . 
2585	1	a	who ? who was it ? who did he fire ? 
2586	4	a	you didn't see it ? 
2587	1	a	no , i went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night . crap ! i never go out on a thursday night; what the hell was i thinking ? 
2588	3	a	i don't understand- hold on . sorry . yes , pam . 
2589	4	a	michael , it's time for the suggestion box meeting . 
2590	3	a	i'm kind of in the middle of something . i wish you wouldn't interrupt . 
2591	4	a	you told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when jan was here . 
2592	3	a	i did not , not , not use those words . 
2593	3	a	no , it's in like ten minutes . 
2594	4	a	everyone's waiting in the conference room . 
2595	1	a	what should we do to prepare for y2k ? 
2596	3	a	well , obviously this one got stuck in the box . that happens occasionally . 
2597	1	a	it happens occasionally . 
2598	3	a	and , um , one down . next suggestion: 'we need better outreach for employees fighting depression' . ok , alright , enough with the jokes . nobody in here is suffering from depression . 
2599	3	a	oh , ok , well , yeah , who wrote it ? 
2600	1	a	tom ? 
2601	3	a	tom . then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named tom . 
2602	3	a	oh , that guy ? that guy was weird . alright , next suggestion . 
2603	1	a	next suggestion . 
2604	3	a	arrr , dooby dooby do . 'you need to do something about your b . o . '
2605	1	a	you need to do something about your b . o . 
2606	3	a	ok , i don't know who this suggestion is meant for , but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion . far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody . 
2607	3	a	well , toby , if by me you are inferring that i have b . o . , then i would say that is a very poor choice of words . 
2608	1	a	you need-
2609	3	a	ok . 
2610	1	a	to do something about-
2611	3	a	shut up , shut up , shut up , dwight , ok . i don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box . 
2612	3	a	yeah , is that hard for you ? alright , well-
2613	3	a	i'll work on that-
2614	1	a	yeah , who wants to come in on a saturday ? 
2615	3	a	yeah , what ? uh , alright , next suggestion . 
2616	1	a	next suggestion . 
2617	3	a	don't sl-' , ok , that's blank don't , just put it-
2618	1	a	don't sleep with your boss' ? do you think this is referring to you boning jan ? 
2619	3	a	i don't understand why you're so upset . 
2620	3	a	let me ask you-
2621	3	a	ok , let me ask you this . 
2622	3	a	let me ask you something . 
2623	3	a	where did you get your outfit ? 
2624	3	a	i just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened . 
2625	3	a	look-
2626	1	a	michael ? 
2627	3	a	oh my god . . . 
2628	1	a	i'm sorry , am i interrupting ? oh god; were you guys making out ? 
2629	1	a	great . 
2630	3	a	what do you want dwight ? 
2631	1	a	i am ready for my performance review . 
2632	3	a	ok , great . your performance has been adequate . you may leave; goodbye . 
2633	3	a	you wanna talk now , good; ok , dwight , leave . 
2634	1	a	uh , wait , i would like to discuss my raise ? 
2635	3	a	why on earth would we give you a raise ? 
2636	1	a	that is an excellent question . thank you for asking . let me bring up one word: dedication . i have never been late . also , i have never missed a day due to illness . even when i had walking pneumonia . i even come in on holidays . 
2637	3	a	you do ? how do you get in ? 
2638	1	a	i have a copy of your key . 
2639	3	a	that is a serious offense . very serious . as is toying with a man's heart . 
2640	1	a	i'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace . 
2641	3	a	ok , third wheel , why don't you do that ? 
2642	1	a	for instance , the time i brought in deer jerky for the whole office . 
2643	3	a	that was deer ! ? gross , oh ! 
2644	1	a	you liked it ! 
2645	3	a	oh , did not ! 
2646	1	a	jan , have you ever had deer ? 
2647	1	a	it's a delicacy . and you know what ? it's an aphrodisiac . so when we're done here , you guys could go over to the antler lodge , sample some deer and talk about my raise . 
2648	3	a	what do you say , jan ? 
2649	3	a	ok . you just , uh , clear your head . 
2650	1	a	and in conclusion , i think that lex luthor said it best when he said 'dad , you have no idea what i'm capable of' . 
2651	3	a	that's from superman ? 
2652	1	a	smallville . and that is why , i feel , that i deserve this raise . 
2653	4	a	do you think michael and jan actually . . . 
2654	2	a	i don't really wanna picture it . but thank you , pam . 
2655	4	a	how do you come back from that ? 
2656	2	a	um , you don't , i don't think , come all the way back , you know . especially working together . 
2657	4	a	no , i mean doing that with michael . how do you come back from that ? 
2658	2	a	oh-
2659	4	a	as a human being . 
2660	2	a	yeah , no , i don't think you can . 
2661	3	a	wait . 
2662	3	a	wait , wait , wait , come , i just , i just wanna know why ? 
2663	3	a	ok , so you're saying that there is a different time or place ? 
2664	3	a	well , ok , well never as in 'never ever ever' , or never as in there's still a chance ? 
2665	3	a	i just want to know , from the horse's mouth , what is the dealio ? 
2666	3	a	am i too short ? 
2667	3	a	really ? 
2668	3	a	i appreciate that , thank you . 
2669	3	a	no , i wasn't , i didn't cry-
2670	3	a	so my looks have nothing to do with it ? 
2671	3	a	jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now . and it doesn't matter how great a guy i am . and that is all i needed; i'm good . i can go home now . 
2672	3	a	hey , it's 12:20; where the hell's dwight ? 
2673	2	a	ummm . . . no idea . 
2674	3	a	never missed a day , my ass . 
2675	4	a	 thank you . 
2676	1	a	 i'm here ! i'm here ! i'm here ! it's ok ! 
2677	3	a	so . . . 
2678	3	a	um , you're in accounting . . . 
2679	3	a	so , good , good , good . something to work toward , being here more . i'm a big believer in people being here more . 
2680	3	a	i am not going to discuss anything outside of dunder mifflin business , period . ' okay . now , why would jan say she only wants to talk business and then make it clear that she is on her period ? god , i don't understand women . how about a clear signal , right ? is that too much to ask ? 
2681	2	a	are we in danger ? 
2682	3	a	there's no time to think about if this is real . just , shh , everybody . 
2683	3	a	the it tech guy and me did not get off to a great start . 
2684	3	a	yeah , i tried to install it myself , but , uh , you guys have these things so password-protected . . . 
2685	3	a	oh . . . 
2686	3	a	oh , umm . . . 
2687	3	a	yes . 
2688	1	a	mi-
2689	3	a	ah ! guh-oood . 
2690	1	a	sorry . 
2691	3	a	please don't do that . 
2692	1	a	ok , i'm sorry . what is going on in there ? why is he here ? what are you doing ? 
2693	3	a	i can't tell you . 
2694	1	a	you have to tell me . 
2695	3	a	i don't have to tell you anything . 
2696	1	a	look , michael , i know you don't want to have to think about this , but if something were to happen to you , god forbid , then i would need to know in order to take over . 
2697	3	a	dwight , nothing is going to happen to me , ok ? i'm in the best shape of my life . look at this . brrr ! that's strong ! 
2698	1	a	yeah , but that doesn't matter , you could get a brain aneurysm-
2699	3	a	i'm not going get a brain-
2700	1	a	or get hit by a car-
2701	3	a	stop it . 
2702	1	a	or a bus or a train . get poisoned , fall in a well , step on a mine , choke . 
2703	3	a	uh , oh , ok; if i step on a mine in scranton , pennsylvania , and die , you can have my job , ok ? why don't you just go . . . away ? 
2704	3	a	there are certain things a boss does not share with his employees . his salary , that would depress them . his bed , it--- and i am not going to tell them that i'll be reading their e-mails . 
2705	3	a	so how do you search ? 
2706	3	a	oh , no , everybody; oscar's gone crazy ! what other ghost stories do you have for us ? that i'm a robot ? i will destroy everything in my path-
2707	3	a	beep ! bop ! 
2708	3	a	bommmm . bop ! onk onk . oil can . oil can . 
2709	3	a	oh , what ? no . that defeats the whole purpose . 
2710	1	a	so it's true ? you have access to our e-mails ? 
2711	3	a	you know what the problem is ? 
2712	3	a	the problem is that when people hear the term 'big brother' , they immediately think it's scary or bad , but i don't . i think , wow , i love my big brother . 
2713	1	a	oh hey , just so ya know , if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails , they need to be deleted immediately . 
2714	1	a	good . 
2715	4	a	 hey . something just happened . dwight just told angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately . 
2716	2	a	what ? 
2717	4	a	i know ! 
2718	2	a	hmm . . . 
2719	4	a	do you think that they're like-
2720	2	a	no . 
2721	4	a	no , right , no , no . 
2722	4	a	uhhh , ew , ew , ew . . . . maybe ? 
2723	4	a	it's like squishing a spider under a book . it's gonna be really gross but i have to look and make sure that it's really dead . sooo . . . if you guys see anything . . . ? 
2724	4	a	hey , dwight , um , my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with . 
2725	1	a	nice . 
2726	4	a	one is tall and brunette , and the other one is short , and blonde , and perky , and kinda judgmental . who do you think he should choose ? 
2727	1	a	does he have access to their medical records ? 
2728	4	a	ummmm . . . 
2729	1	a	i think one of the greatest things about modern america is the computerization of medical records . as a volunteer sheriff , i can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories . yeast infections . there are a huge number of yeast infections in this county . probably because we are down river from that old bread factory . 
2730	3	a	meredith has an e-vite from jim . barbeque at jim's tonight . tonight ? wonder where my e-vitation is . click on guest list . angela , stanley , oscar , meredith , phyllis , kevin , creed . must be . . . . no . 
2731	4	a	hey , angela-
2732	4	a	how's it going ? 
2733	4	a	listen , are you bringing anyone to jim's party tonight ? 
2734	4	a	no . i mean , i don't know , i don't think so . 
2735	4	a	oh . 
2736	3	a	there's always a distance between a boss and the employees . it is just nature's rule . it's intimidation mostly , it's the awareness that they are not me . i do think that i am very approachable , as one of the guys . but maybe i need to be even approachabler . 
2737	4	a	yeah . 
2738	3	a	of course . hangin' with my crew , crew that i am one of . hangin' with my cup of noodles . this is a meal in a cup . 
2739	2	a	uh hum . 
2740	3	a	hot , tasty . reminds me of college . lived on this stuff . brain food . mmmm . . . you know what i really , really miss about college ? the parties . everybody'd go . the athletes , the , the nerds , professors . 
2741	4	a	the professors would go to the parties ? 
2742	3	a	yeah ! they were the most fun . we always invited them . 
2743	4	a	 what ? ohhhh . . . yes ! thank you ! 
2744	1	a	question: on the internet there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight-
2745	2	a	oh , uh , no . could-
2746	1	a	i was wondering-
2747	2	a	could , keep that down . 
2748	1	a	why ? 
2749	2	a	because not everybody knows about the party . 
2750	1	a	like who ? who doesn't know ? 
2751	2	a	umm , michael . 
2752	1	a	why just michael ? 
2753	2	a	because it's a surprise . 
2754	1	a	is it ? 
2755	2	a	uh hmm . 
2756	1	a	oh , that's perfect ! 
2757	2	a	so , don't tell . 
2758	1	a	i won't . 
2759	2	a	ok . 
2760	2	a	so , dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for michael . 
2761	4	a	really ? that's great . 
2762	2	a	i know . 
2763	4	a	maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere . 
2764	2	a	 oh man . oh , you know what , speaking of which , i was just trying to get a handle on , you know , numbers for food and stuff . so do you think that roy's gonna come , or . . . 
2765	4	a	oh , no , he can't make it .

2870	2	a	really ? 
2871	4	a	yeah , it turns out i was , um , just grasping at straws . 
2872	4	a	just because two people are hanging out , it doesn't mean that they're together , you know ? like people can just be friends . and i think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on . 
2873	1	a	surprise ! everybody ! 
2874	3	a	we're making love ! 
2875	3	a	talk ! just talk !

2896	3	a	well , that is a perfectly good mini-tree , kevin . and we are going to sell that to charity . that's what christmas is all about . 
2897	3	a	 merry christmas ! ho , ho , ho , pimp . i'm kidding . what do we got , what do we got ? how many plates are we getting ? 
2898	3	a	double it . double everything . double ice cream . double napkins . double it . on me . 
2899	3	a	it was a tough year . i had to fire somebody this year . this party has to really rock . check it out . christmas bonus . 3 , 000 g's . i got this for helping save the company money . so i guess some good came out of firing devon after all . maybe i should call him and tell him that . 
2900	4	a	you do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party . 
2901	3	a	yeah , i know . damn it . stupid corporate wet blankets . like booze ever killed anybody . 
2902	1	a	you guys should use a hand truck . 
2903	1	a	no . 
2904	3	a	no ! no way ! it . . . no . 
2905	3	a	you wanna be santa ? 
2906	3	a	have you ever seen santa ? 
2907	3	a	okay . 
2908	3	a	well , i'm sorry . it just doesn't work . 
2909	1	a	michael , i would like to be the elf . 
2910	3	a	that makes sense because he has elfish features . 
2911	1	a	 okay , everybody listen up ! it is time to get your presents , wrap them , and place them under the tree like so . if you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from secret santa . all right ? no exceptions except michael . 
2912	3	a	you get something good this year ? 
2913	2	a	i think i did a pretty good job . 
2914	3	a	yeah ? who did you have ? 
2915	2	a	well , i can't tell you cause it's a secret . 
2916	3	a	i think i got something pretty nice for my guy . 
2917	2	a	yeah ? 
2918	3	a	i spent a lot of dough . lot of dough . wow . 
2919	2	a	well , there's a $20 limit , right ? so . . ? 
2920	3	a	yeah . i wanted this party to be really special so i sorta went above and beyond . 
2921	2	a	that's great . well don't tell me who it is , cause i can . . 
2922	3	a	it was ryan . yeah . i have ryan . 
2923	1	a	gather round . secret santa , let's go . let's go . come on . stanley , no , i'm going to handle the cord . okay , safety reasons . 
2924	1	a	i want to do it . 
2925	3	a	all right , let's count it down , like rockefeller center . ready ? 
2926	3	a	not great . 
2927	4	a	i think the tree looks nice . 
2928	1	a	hey , i could get some flares from my car . 
2929	3	a	no , no . shake it off , everybody . just , let's do secret santa . 
2930	3	a	presents are the best way to show someone how much you care . it's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say , 'hey , man , i love you this many dollars worth . '
2931	1	a	first present , oscar . 
2932	1	a	okay . okay . that's enough . let's keep it moving on . jim . 
2933	2	a	oh , cool . 
2934	2	a	great . where did you get it ? 
2935	2	a	he obviously forgot to get me something , and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number and then threw it in a bag . 
2936	1	a	pam . 
2937	4	a	 oh , my god ! thank you very much , santa , whoever you are . it's awesome . 
2938	2	a	there's a little more to it . 
2939	1	a	all right , next . ryan . 
2940	3	a	no , don't ! 
2941	3	a	whoa . wow . jeez . somebody really got carried away with the spirit of christmas . that was me , i got a little carried away . 
2942	3	a	you don't know that . 
2943	3	a	i did ? 
2944	3	a	what ? oh , shoot . wow . okay , well , who cares ? it doesn't matter what i spent . what matters is that christmas is fun , right ? 
2945	1	a	michael . 
2946	3	a	oh hey , for me . what is in here ? oh , come on . 
2947	3	a	an oven mitt ? okay . 
2948	3	a	so phyllis is basically saying , 'hey michael , i know you did a lot to help the office this year but i only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth . ' i gave ryan an ipod . 
2949	1	a	we don't do anything until michael gives us further instructions . 
2950	3	a	i got it ! we are going to turn secret santa into yankee swap . 
2951	2	a	what is yankee swap ? 
2952	3	a	one person chooses a gift . the next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift . if your gift gets stolen , then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift . 
2953	2	a	i thought that was called nasty christmas . 
2954	4	a	yeah , we call it white elephant . 
2955	3	a	well , i call it fun ! 
2956	3	a	because it's better . because it's more special . 
2957	3	a	shut it . no , it's not . okay , just give it a shot . 
2958	3	a	okay , meredith is up first . here's the deal . you can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten , like the oven mitt . 
2959	2	a	oh , shouldn't we . . . i bought that specifically for pam . 
2960	3	a	yankee swap ! that's what makes it fun . pam , you can steal the oven mitt now . 
2961	4	a	i'll take the ipod . 
2962	1	a	yes , now you can steal the oven mitt , the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift . 
2963	3	a	i think this is going great . 
2964	1	a	angela , you're up . 
2965	3	a	everyone wants the ipod . it's a huge hit . it is almost a christmas miracle . 
2966	3	a	oh , well , oscar , you little gourmand , you have the next turn . 
2967	1	a	okay , moving along . meredith , let's go . 
2968	1	a	it's already been stolen this round . pick something else . 
2969	3	a	 i hope nobody takes this baby , cause this is great . wow , look at that fine craftsmanship . somebody really put a lot of work into that . it's beautiful . 
2970	3	a	sucker ! see , i wanted somebody to take it . boom ! reverse psychology . 
2971	3	a	reverse psychology is an awesome tool . i don't know if you guys know about it , but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid . works like a charm . 
2972	3	a	 'in addition to these paintball pellets , your gift includes two paintball lessons with dwight schrute . '
2973	1	a	you and me , michael . yes ! 
2974	3	a	who wants to take paintball lessons ? how is that better than an ipod ? 
2975	1	a	i never said it was better than an ipod . 
2976	1	a	michael keeps bragging about his ipod , but you know what ? two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as i am is worth easily , like , 2 grand . 
2977	1	a	 take that , saddam ! 
2978	3	a	last gift . kevin . 
2979	1	a	pam , steal something or pick the final gift . 
2980	4	a	i want the ipod . 
2981	2	a	sure you don't want the teapot ? 
2982	4	a	well , i mean , it's an ipod . but . . 
2983	2	a	right . 
2984	4	a	sorry , i . . 
2985	2	a	no . no . definitely . it's . . 
2986	1	a	yes ! there you go . i want the teapot . gracias . 
2987	2	a	got to be kidding me . 
2988	1	a	yankee swap is like machiavelli meets . . . christmas . 
2989	3	a	 what is she so upset about ? 
2990	4	a	maybe because you hated her present so much . 
2991	3	a	come on ! i think that yankee swap was a big hit ! i think it's a success and i'm the one who ended up with dwight's stupid paintball pellets . 
2992	2	a	yeah , but , michael , the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people . 
2993	3	a	well , i didn't . i got a big bonus because i fired devon , and i used the money to buy something awesome . sue me ! 
2994	4	a	how much ? 
2995	3	a	it wasn't . it wasn't that much . it was $3 , 000 . 
2996	3	a	unbelievable . i do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out . well , happy birthday , jesus . sorry your party's so lame . 
2997	3	a	all right , now , you're the expert . is this enough to get 20 people plastered ? 
2998	3	a	cool , cool . box it up . 
2999	2	a	i bought this teapot for pam , and i know she really wants it . so , can i trade you for it ? 
3000	1	a	no trades . 
3001	2	a	come on , it's a shamrock keychain . good luck . 
3002	1	a	a real man makes his own luck . ' billy zane . 
3003	2	a	look , it has sentimental value , dwight . can i buy it from you ? 
3004	1	a	no . i want it . i'm going to use it . 
3005	2	a	you don't even drink tea . 
3006	1	a	true . but i get sinus infections , and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems . . 
3007	2	a	okay . . 
3008	1	a	 . . and pouring it directly into your nose , like so . 
3009	2	a	to think that my gift for pam will be used for that , it's a little too much to handle . 
3010	4	a	i know . it's totally going to change the way i work out . 
3011	4	a	so what are you going to get me instead ? 
3012	3	a	uh-oh . looks like santa was a little naughty . 
3013	3	a	this is christmas spirit , as in spirits , booze . 
3014	3	a	zip it , toby ! just . . i mean , it's a party . come on . if i can't throw a good party for my employees , then i am a terrible boss . who wants a drink ? 
3015	3	a	go , here we go ! 
3016	3	a	anybody making out in here ? not yet , give it time . oh , hey , ebenezer , boink . okay , how's it going in here ? 
3017	3	a	no , no , no , no . we'll find some , don't leave the party . 
3018	3	a	kudos to ryan , king of the party committee . 
3019	3	a	yeah , yeah , yeah . 
3020	3	a	oh , no , no . no false modesty , my friend . 
3021	2	a	you know , you don't have to answer calls during a party . just thought you should know . 
3022	4	a	 no , i was just checking out my present . 
3023	2	a	but . . 
3024	4	a	i traded with dwight . just , i figured , you know , you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot . and also , roy got me an ipod or was going to get me an ipod , so . . 
3025	2	a	well , either way . this is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts . look inside . 
3026	4	a	 oh my god ! the yearbook picture ! 
3027	4	a	yeah , i think i made the right choice . 
3028	4	a	oh , my god ! it's incredible . is this the boggle timer ? 
3029	2	a	i didn't think you were going to get that one . i really didn't . 
3030	1	a	this is so awesome . 
3031	3	a	not bad . and if it couldn't go to ryan , you are the guy i'd want it to go to . 
3032	1	a	thank you . 
3033	3	a	you're welcome . 
3034	3	a	no way . oh , you're kidding me . packer ! yes ! todd packer , ladies and gentlemen ! 
3035	3	a	oh , no , no . oh look at that . icing on the cake . 
3036	3	a	oh , let's fix you up . who wants to fix up . . toby . toby's gonna fix you up . 
3037	3	a	darryl . there you go . you earned it . 
3038	3	a	no , no , no , no . i really , really want you to have it . 
3039	3	a	hey , merry christmas . 
3040	3	a	 lampshade on head ! it's happening ! 
3041	1	a	oh , hello there . but what are you doing ? 
3042	1	a	you shouldn't do things like that . the man is supposed to do that . 
3043	1	a	yes . 
3044	3	a	yeah , that sounds good . 
3045	3	a	christmas is awesome . first of all , you get to spend time with people you love . secondly , you can get drunk and no one can say anything . third , you give presents . what's better than giving presents ? and fourth , getting presents . so , four things . not bad for one day . it's really the greatest day of all time . 
3046	3	a	hey , meredith . heading over to poor richard's ? 
3047	3	a	cool , cool , cool . do you need a ride ? all right , let's head out . sounds good . do you have a coat ? 
3048	3	a	okay ! 
3049	3	a	phyllis and angela and meredith are helpers . i guess angela's kind of . . . angela's little . phyllis and meredith are not little . pam is sort of a medium helper . 
3050	3	a	dwight is . . . dwight looks like spock to me . he always wears the ears , and i always give him grief about looking like spock , and he hates it because he has a different pair of ears that he wears to be spock , for some reason . 
3051	1	a	what separates humans from jungle beasts ? the fact that we have rules . when humans give each other gifts , they do it properly and orderly . when bears give each other gifts they just rip open a fox carcass and present it to their mate . i prefer the human way . 
3052	2	a	hey . 
3053	1	a	hello . jim ? 
3054	2	a	what's up , buddy ? 
3055	1	a	this is not funny . why is my stuff in here ? 
3056	2	a	wow , that's weird . oh , dollar for a stapler , that's pretty good . 
3057	1	a	yeah , well , i'm not paying for my own stuff , okay ? i know you did this , because you're friends with the vending machine guy . 
3058	2	a	who , steve ? 
3059	1	a	yeah , steve , whatever his name is . 
3060	4	a	sorry . what do i want ? what do i want . . . oh , it's a pencil cup . 
3061	1	a	no , no , no , no , no . that's my pencil cup . 
3062	4	a	um , i don't think so , i just bought it . 
3063	1	a	uh , i think so , and you're going to hand it over to me . 
3064	4	a	i love these . 
3065	1	a	okay , fine . where's my wallet ? 
3066	2	a	oh , there it is . j1 . 
3067	1	a	but i don't have any . . .

3071	1	a	good morning , michael . 
3072	3	a	ah ! ha ha ha ! 
3073	4	a	last week , michael sent out this mysterious memo . 
3074	2	a	it's time for our first quarter camaraderie event , so pack a swimsuit , a toothbrush , rubber-soled shoes , and a ski mask . '
3075	4	a	a ski mask and a swimsuit . 
3076	2	a	so that he can have us rob a bank , and then escape through the sewers . 
3077	4	a	and brush our teeth . 
3078	3	a	yeah ? 
3079	3	a	stanley ! bo banley . 
3080	3	a	banana fana fo fanley . 
3081	3	a	be my mo manley . 
3082	3	a	stanley . 
3083	3	a	maybe . the suspense is just so exciting , isn't it ? 
3084	3	a	maybe , i don't know . 
3085	3	a	well , no . but . . . okay , don't spoil it for everybody , all right ? but we are going on a booze cruise on lake wallenpaupack . 
3086	3	a	it's cheaper . 
3087	3	a	this is not just another party . this is a leadership training exercise . right ? i'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience . 
3088	3	a	it is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat . we are going on a harbor cruise of lake wallenpaupack . it's a booze cruise ! 
3089	3	a	no . this is mandatory . but don't worry , you know what ? you're gonna learn plenty . this is gonna turn your life around , ryan . 
3090	3	a	well , this . . . 
3091	3	a	yeah ? 
3092	3	a	to throw you off the scent . 
3093	3	a	well , just keep the tags on and you can return it . 
3094	3	a	well , that's not my fault , okay ? just . . we're not going to pay for a bathing suit . okay , i know what you're all thinking , 'who is this smart little cookie ? ' her name is brenda . . . something , and she is from corporate . and she is here , like you , to learn from what i have to say . 
3095	3	a	i am a great motivational speaker . i attended a tony robbins event by the airport last year , and . . . it wasn't the actual course . you have to pay for the actual course . but it talked about the actual course . and i've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course . 
3096	3	a	leader . . . ship . the word 'ship' is hidden inside the word 'leadership , ' as its derivation . so if this office is , in fact , a ship , as its leader , i am the captain . but we're all in the same boat . teamwork ! 
3097	3	a	now , on this ship that is the office , what is a sales department ? anyone ? 
3098	3	a	yes , darryl , the sales department makes sales . good . let me just explain . i see the sales department as the furnace . 
3099	2	a	yeesh , how old is this ship ? 
3100	4	a	how about the anchor ? 
3101	3	a	all right , let's not get hung up on the furnace . this just . . . it's the sales . . . i see the sales department down there . they're in the engine room , and they are shoveling coal into the furnace , right ? i mean , who saw the movie titanic ? they were very important in the movie titanic . who saw it ? show of hands ! 
3102	2	a	i'm not really sure what movie you're talking about . are you sure you got the title right ? 
3103	3	a	titanic ? 
3104	4	a	i think you're thinking of the hunt for red october . 
3105	3	a	no , i'm leo dicaprio ! come on ! 
3106	2	a	michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour , or i give you my next paycheck . 
3107	3	a	no ! thank you , spoiler alert . you saw the movie , those of you who did . they're happy down there in the furnace room . and they're dirty and grimy and sweaty , and they're singing their ethnic songs , and . . . actually , that might be warehouse . 
3108	3	a	the . . . no , no . no , i didn't . . . okay . well , okay , in a nutshell , what i'm saying is . . . leadership . we'll talk more about that on the boat . ship . 
3109	1	a	aye aye , captain .

3112	1	a	cool . 
3113	3	a	i'd rather die . hi , i am michael scott , i am the captain of this party . 
3114	3	a	okay . 
3115	3	a	in an office , when you are ranking people , manager is higher than captain . on a boat , who knows ? it's nebulose . 
3116	3	a	hey , look ! i'm king of the world ! 
3117	3	a	and i am the regional manager of dunder-mifflin , michael scott . welcome , welcome !

3131	3	a	well , we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the gilligan thing , so . . . right now , i was thinking . yes . okay , listen up all you dunder-mifflinites ! i would like to talk to you all about life preservers . now , one important life preserver in business is it support .

3137	3	a	but before that , i have to do my presentation . 
3138	3	a	all right , we'll have a motivational dance contest ! hit it ! yeah , okay , dancing ! it is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate ! 
3139	3	a	sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things . sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing . 
3140	1	a	 what do you do with a drunken sailor ? what do you do with a drunken sailor ? what do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning ? 
3141	1	a	i can't . do you want us to run aground , woman ? ! 
3142	4	a	no , i'm not going to do that .

3542	1	a	question ? may i investigate ? 
3543	3	a	yeah . drop what you're doing . make this a priority . because an office can't function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs . 
3544	4	a	i bought my veil . 
3545	4	a	ummm . . . 
3546	4	a	ok . i was thinking about wearing it down . kind of like , i don't know , like loose with big curls and . . .

3548	2	a	yeah . on the booze cruise i told michael about some feelings i used to have for pam . i had just broken up with katy and had a couple drinks . and i confided in the world's worst confidant .

3550	3	a	hey jim-bag . 
3551	2	a	remember that thing i told you on the booze cruise about pam ? that . . . was . . . personal so if we can just keep that between you and me . that would be great . 
3552	3	a	really ? 
3553	2	a	umm , hmm . 
3554	3	a	who else knows ? 
3555	2	a	nobody . 
3556	3	a	wow ! 
3557	3	a	jim and i are great friends . we hang out a ton , mostly at work . but , the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship . and it is why , i intend on keeping that secret for as long as i possibly can . 
3558	3	a	my lips are sealed . my lips are sealed . . . bangles . 
3559	2	a	alright . great . thank you .

3577	1	a	hey oscar how ya doin' ? dwight schrute calling . listen a little question for you , buddy . i called six minutes ago and no one answered . so i was wondering if you could explain . oh , i see , so . sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy . 
3578	1	a	there are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying . the liar will avoid direct eye contact . the liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands , especially the mouth . the liar will perspire . unfortunately i spoke to oscar on the phone so none of this is useful . 
3579	3	a	it's grrrrrrape ! soda . 
3580	2	a	tony the tiger . you don't hear that much any more . 
3581	3	a	not so much .

3585	3	a	fact: i love grape soda . i always have . fact: jim and i talk all the time . we tell each other secrets . 
3586	1	a	ok . so what is the secret michael ? 
3587	2	a	um , i had asked michael if i could head up the oscar investigation and he said that only dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material .

3641	4	a	i hate you . 
3642	1	a	quick oscar update . i have conducted interviews with everyone in the office . 
3643	3	a	just go to his house and see if he's sick . i could have done this investigation in like twenty minutes . 
3644	1	a	including prep time ? 
3645	3	a	just do it . 
3646	3	a	 expenses . 
3647	3	a	no . it's . . . i wear it like that sometimes . is that a wig ? 
3648	3	a	yeah , it's a business lunch . 
3649	3	a	no he did not . i don't need his permission . 
3650	3	a	uhhh it's ridiculous . they took my card away because i spent $80 bucks at a magic shop . what they don't understand is that i bought the stuff to impress potential clients . so business related , right ? 
3651	3	a	i put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter . and you know what toby ? they almost bought from us . 
3652	3	a	look jim needed a relaxing lunch , he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity . how is that not work related ? 
3653	3	a	you're not his friend , you don't know . he is in love with a girl he works with who's engaged . so just cut me some slack . please ? 
3654	3	a	you know what kevin ? jim is a friend of mine , so the only people that this crush really concerns is jim and pam . . . and me . 
3655	1	a	as a volunteer sheriff's deputy i have been doing surveillance for years . one time i suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me . so i tailed her for six straight nights . turns out she was , with a couple of guys actually so . . . mystery solved . 
3656	2	a	well the cats out of the bag . i used to have a crush on pam and now i don't . riveting . 
3657	4	a	hey . 
3658	2	a	hey . 
3659	4	a	did you find anything good in your desk ? 
3660	2	a	ah , coupon for a free sandwich . 
3661	4	a	score . 
3662	2	a	it expired in august , and my cell phone charger from two years ago . 
3663	4	a	big day . 
3664	2	a	big day . 
3665	2	a	hey oh , listen , um , i told michael on the booze cruise . it's so stupid . um , i told michael that i had had a crush on you when you first started here . 
3666	4	a	oh . 
3667	2	a	well i thought that , i figured you should hear it from me rather than , i mean you know michael . 
3668	4	a	right . 
3669	2	a	and seriously , it's totally not a big deal , ok ? and when i found out you were engaged , i mean . 
3670	4	a	no , i know , like , i kind of like , i thought that maybe you did when i first started . 
3671	2	a	oh you did ? 
3672	4	a	no , i mean , just 'cause we like got along so well . 
3673	2	a	no , no , you saw through me , great . 
3674	4	a	so are you going to be like totally awkward around me now ? 
3675	2	a	oh yeah , yeah . . . hope that's okay . 
3676	4	a	mmm , hmm . 
3677	2	a	and pam it was like three years ago so i am totally over it .

3681	1	a	this is dwight schrute . who is this ? 
3682	1	a	how bout this . i don't tell michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor . redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing . 
3683	1	a	guess what i found out about oscar tonight ? he was lying about being sick . should i have reported oscar's malfeasance . hmm , probably , but now i know something he doesn't want me to know . so i can use his malfeasance to establish leverage . otherwise , it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake . 
3684	2	a	hey . 
3685	3	a	i know , i know , i know . 
3686	2	a	umm , what happened ? 
3687	3	a	i , oh , just , um , i know i was trying to , expense reports . and then god , toby , you know he just . . . i know . i'm just , i just hope that , i just hope that this doesn't affect our friendship ! stupid , this is so stupid .

3697	4	a	no , really , it's okay . i know that jim had , like a crush on me when he first started . but that was a long time ago , so . 
3698	3	a	it wasn't that long ago . it was on the booze cruise .

3777	3	a	i will gladly pay you tuesday for a hamburger today . 
3778	3	a	oh , a customer , well , sound the alarm . okay . 
3779	3	a	another time , packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute . guy had no sense of humor about it . probably why he wasn't hired . 
3780	3	a	charley horse ! 
3781	3	a	charley horse ! 
3782	3	a	oh , okay . gah . 
3783	3	a	once , as a joke , packer banged every chick in the office . it was hysterical .

3823	3	a	you know what , guys ? it's none of your concern . it was official business , so just . . . 
3824	3	a	yeah , paper business . is this done ? 
3825	3	a	extreme home makeover puts together a house in an hour . if you were on that crew , you would be fired like that . 
3826	4	a	somebody did something bad to michael's carpet . maybe that's all we need to know . 
3827	3	a	this was no act of god . a person did this . a person who works in this office . maybe all of them . 
3828	3	a	you know what ? today is not a good day for a sales contest . we're . . . we're not . . . we're not doin' this today . 
3829	4	a	that doesn't seem fair . 
3830	3	a	you wanna talk about fair ? does anyone need to smell my old carpet ? you explain to me how that was fair , and i'll explain to you how this is fair . plus i just . . . i think that picking today was sort of taking advantage . 
3831	1	a	but you're the one who picked today . 
3832	3	a	i am a victim of a hate crime . stanley knows what i'm talkin' about . 
3833	3	a	well i hated it ! a lot ! okay , i . . . you know what ? if the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment , we'd be done . very well . then you are all punished . 
3834	4	a	what's our punishment ? 
3835	3	a	you're all on a time out . just sit there quietly . no . no ! 
3836	2	a	hey ! 
3837	2	a	nothing much . let me ask you something . it's actually little awkward . 
3838	2	a	what do you think of kelly ? 
3839	2	a	are you interested in her ? 
3840	2	a	really ? 
3841	2	a	she said lots of things . 
3842	2	a	i have no idea .

3844	3	a	do you remember ed truck ? 
3845	3	a	how would i know ?

3847	3	a	 i wasn't talking literally , creed . yeah , being buried alive would be worse . happy ? why am i talking to you ? 
3848	3	a	 ed ? hi . thanks for meeting me . must be kinda neat comin' back . 
3849	3	a	uh , well , honestly ed , i really don't wanna be up there right now . 
3850	3	a	oh , no , no , no . you're good . it was clerical . you're good . um , well , somebody did something in my office , and i now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me . 
3851	3	a	i didn't get a good look at . . . it , but it smells horrible . 
3852	3	a	really ? 
3853	3	a	well , that figures . so how did you deal with people not liking you ? 
3854	3	a	well . . . s-sure i can . 
3855	3	a	not necessarily . you can love a boss like you do a father . 
3856	3	a	well , okay . different management styles . 
3857	2	a	yep . 
3858	3	a	 yes . 
3859	3	a	who is this ? how did you get this number ?

3867	3	a	oh . yeah , yeah ! oh my god . it was packer ! 
3868	3	a	it takes an advanced sense of humor . i don't expect everybody to understand . it was done out of love , just like i thought . it's ah . . . god , these people are so . . . these are good people . we have fun . we just have fun ! oh , i'm just so sorry that i threw the thing out . 
3869	4	a	 hey , jim . it's pam . i keep looking up to say something to you and then michael's there and it's horrible . anyway , i'm bored . come back ! 
3870	4	a	 hey , guess what ? i moved my computer so i can't see michael's head . it's working . i think i can have a career as a very specific type of decorator . 
3871	4	a	 sudoku . level moderate . 18 minutes . suck on that , halpert . 
3872	4	a	 i'll transfer you . dunder mifflin , this is pam . hold , please . dunder mifflin , this is . . . okay , sorry . michael was standing at my desk , and i needed to be busy or who knows what would've happened , so thank you . 
3873	4	a	 hey , what's that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe ? anyway , i have a thing stuck in my shoe . 
3874	4	a	 hey , i have a chance to sneak out of here early , and i'm not messing this up , so i'll see you tomorrow . 
3875	4	a	 calling from my cell phone . i don't know if you guys figured out who did that to michael's carpet yet , but i have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy . everybody in the office . we need to talk . 
3876	2	a	hey . 
3877	2	a	so , you used to share that cubicle with kelly , right ? 
3878	2	a	and then you just changed desks , right ? 
3879	2	a	to one without a cubicle . 
3880	2	a	so , you just couldn't take it anymore , huh ? 
3881	2	a	so , that's how it's gonna be . 
3882	4	a	today's a 'women in the workplace' thing . jan's coming in from corporate to talk to all the women about . . . um . . . i don't really know what . but michael's not allowed in . she said that about five times . 
3883	3	a	 hey , what's going on ? 
3884	3	a	yeah . . . i . . . you know what . . . i . . . i . . . i just thought about it . i just have a few things i want to say . 
3885	3	a	hold . . . just hear me out . what is more important than quality ? e-quality . now studies show that today's woman , the ally mcbeal woman , as i call her , is at a crossroads . . . 
3886	3	a	no , just uh . . . you have come a long way , baby . but i just . . . just want to keep it within reason . 
3887	3	a	they did this up in albany . . . 
3888	3	a	and they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so . . . 
3889	3	a	well , i'm their boss , so i feel like . . . 
3890	3	a	 anybody want any coffee or . . . 
3891	3	a	women in the workplace . . . yeah , translation 'i have been banned from my own conference room so that jan can talk in secret to all the girls . ' oh ! sorry . 'women of the workplace . ' about what ? i don't know . clothes . me . eeegkh !

4061	3	a	cool . good , good , good . give us some time to catch up , and . . . 
4062	1	a	pam . hi , how ya doing ? good . listen , uh may i speak with you . . . privately ? 
4063	4	a	you can't fire me , dwight , just 'cause michael's not here . 
4064	1	a	no , pam , just . just , 
4065	4	a	you need to get something for your girlfriend . 
4066	1	a	 girlfriend . yes , and the reason i didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into valentine's day . she's kind of . . . 
4067	4	a	tightly wound ? 
4068	1	a	 exactly . 
4069	4	a	ok , well , sometimes the gift is really about the gesture , you know , like what it means , instead of what it is . 
4070	1	a	you mean , like a ham ? 
4071	4	a	no , not like a ham . it's about doing something , so that the person knows that you really care about her . 
4072	1	a	ok , i get it . 
4073	4	a	that you remember her . 
4074	1	a	ok , shut up . i know exactly what to do . 
4075	3	a	ay , kay . come on , you know , that's not . cool it . 
4076	3	a	maybe because she's my girlfriend . was , or not my girlfriend . she's . . . we hooked up and . . . 
4077	3	a	you know , months ago , just once , it's , just stupid . just forget it , 
4078	3	a	yeah , yeah . 
4079	2	a	take it slow . 'cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need . . . 
4080	2	a	 oh , no , not while i'm here . 
4081	3	a	ditto . how are you jan ? 
4082	3	a	what is a business ? is it a collection of numbers and sales reports ? sure . but as you know , david and jan , it is much more . 
4083	3	a	yeah , i shot a bunch of footage around the office , edited it together on my mac . i was thinking of entering it into some festivals . probably won't . you know , not what this is about . 
4084	3	a	questions ? 
4085	3	a	yes , thank you . 
4086	3	a	yes , absolutely david . get that for you . i umm . . . 
4087	4	a	yeah . 
4088	4	a	 oscar . 
4089	4	a	 join the club . 
4090	2	a	you know what ? here's the deal , kelly . it would be really nice if he was in to you , right ? it'd be great , but he isn't . 
4091	2	a	well , he's not , though . so you just gotta suck it up . you just gotta move on . try to have some fun . come to my poker game tonight . 
4092	3	a	oh , ok . alright . 
4093	3	a	no you're not . 
4094	3	a	technically , we fell asleep in the same bed . so . . . 
4095	3	a	yes . i'm sorry . i will fix this . i'll talk to him . i'll talk to david . 
4096	3	a	i am serious . and don't call me shirley . airplane . 
4097	1	a	women are like wolves . if you want a wolf , you have to trap it . you have to snare it . and then you have to tame it . keep it happy . care for it . feed it . lovingly , the way an animal deserves to be loved . and my animal deserves a lot of loving . 
4098	4	a	hey . 
4099	4	a	i guess , yeah . 
4100	4	a	nothing , it's just i had to sit here all day , while phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her . 
4101	4	a	i mean , i know that we said no big gifts , but i was kind of hoping you'd get me
4102	3	a	no no no no no , yes i , ok , well , alright , here's the deal . it's my fault . this is , this is totally on me . before you guys came in , i was talking to the guys . we were all chatting and i made a joke , a really dumb joke and craig the idiot took it seriously . 
4103	3	a	i did , it was stupid . and craig , you saw him , he's not the sharpest tool in the shed . although he is a tool . 
4104	3	a	i know . it was borderline at best and . . . and jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um , i'm really sorry . it will never happen again . 
4105	4	a	heading out ? 
4106	2	a	yeah . alright , beesly , hey , happy valentine's day . 
4107	4	a	bye . 
4108	4	a	night phyllis . 
4109	3	a	oh , no big deal . really . sorry again . 
4110	3	a	yeah , happy valentine's day . 
4111	3	a	oy vey . . . schmear . 
4112	4	a	michael's got a few tricks for valentine's day . he found a place where you can get 12 plastic roses for $10 and he's got a great line . 'me so thorny . '
4113	3	a	i love you , angela . yes , even you . i love you , kelly . i love you , meredith . this is all platonically , of course . 
4114	3	a	i love ladies , always have . and you know what i think is the most attractive part of a woman's body ? the brains . because i don't think a woman is beautiful unless she is smart . and also , the brains are where the ladies get their best nasty ideas for bedroom stuff . 
4115	2	a	dwight lives on a beet farm and he practices karate at the forth grade level . and he apparently has a girlfriend , so . . . i guess there really is someone for everybody . 
4116	3	a	let's think this through . if we ask corporate for that then . . . 
4117	1	a	they are either going to say yes . . . or no . 
4118	3	a	could go either way . we don't know what they are going to say . 
4119	1	a	think it through . 
4120	3	a	have to think it through . because if they say no . . . 
4121	2	a	can we not ? 
4122	3	a	no ! yes , we have to ! you know why ? because i don't like to be cooped up in that office ! in that box ! all day long . heisman ! because i need to think . okay , jim ? oh , kevin , oh ! nice catch . mmmm , mmm , mmm , mmm . os-car ! intercepted . 
4123	2	a	still want that . 
4124	3	a	give it to me . phyllis , give me the ball . ok , give me the ball . give me , you guys . . . creed give me the ball ! right now give it to me . 
4125	1	a	fumble ! yaaah ! 
4126	3	a	hey , dwight . 
4127	1	a	hut ! hut ! hut ! hike ! 
4128	3	a	you all right ryan ? 
4129	1	a	ryan . 
4130	3	a	pam ! 
4131	1	a	ooh . they're having a sale on tivo . maybe i should get a tivo . oh . dvd burner ! maybe i should get one of those . you are so lucky , jim . you are so lucky you don't have this problem . what was the 9th place prize again ? a loaf of bread ? 
4132	2	a	cugino's pizza . 
4133	1	a	oh , great . tasty , terrific pizza . hmm . question: do their pizzas play dvds ? 
4134	2	a	dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company . he wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention . it is literally the highest possible honor that a northeastern pennsylvania-based mid-size paper company regional salesman can attain , so . . . 
4135	2	a	what did i do to deserve this ? 
4136	4	a	are you sad that dwight beat you ? 
4137	2	a	no . 
4138	4	a	are you going to cry , jim ? do you need a tissue ? 
4139	4	a	oh ! i . . . uh . . . yeah . um . . . i'll uh show them to you later . 
4140	2	a	oh , i should get back . talk to you guys later . 
4141	4	a	ok , cool . 
4142	4	a	i have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding . and i have to do it in the office . and that can be kind of awkward . um . . . just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff . then . . . i just . . . i don't want to offend . . . angela . . . or someone . 
4143	3	a	that's what she said ! 
4144	1	a	ha ! i don't get it . 
4145	3	a	grapes . seductive . so you ready for the big speech this afternoon ? 
4146	1	a	well , it's not really a big speech . you still coming right ? 
4147	3	a	oh ! abso-fruit-ly . fruit . grapes . nailed the joke . matter of time . um . . . and yes , it is a big speech . biggest of your life . 
4148	1	a	what if i give a really long , extended thank you . for instance , 'thank you , mr . blank . thank you very , very , very . . . '
4149	3	a	that would look terrible . these are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act . 
4150	1	a	when i was in the sixth grade , i was a finalist in our school spelling bee . it was me against raj patel . and i misspelled , in front of the entire school , the word 'failure' . 
4151	1	a	i can't do this . 
4152	3	a	that's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how . because you have no skills . dwight , there's no way i can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time . 
4153	1	a	oh , okay . 
4154	3	a	but i can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company . 
4155	1	a	okay , deal ! i'll do whatever you say . no questions asked . 
4156	3	a	well , if you have a question , you should ask me . 
4157	1	a	i'll try and think of one . when . . . 
4158	3	a	don't . don't try and think of a question to humor me . just . . . try not to be such an idiot . 
4159	1	a	is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice ? 
4160	3	a	insult . 
4161	4	a	mom , i'm sorry . i know you and dad are chipping in for the wedding but i do not want orange invitations . yes ! well , if you really want my . . . 
4162	2	a	hi , yeah , can i talk to one of your travel agents ? 
4163	2	a	i'm going to take a trip . i'm going to get out of town for a while . . . and go someplace . . . not here . 
4164	2	a	where do i want to go ? um . . . that is an excellent question . and one i should have probably thought about before i called you . um . . . 
4165	3	a	 but seriously , what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman ? 
4166	1	a	saleswoman has a vagina . 
4167	3	a	it's a joke , dwight . it's not a sex ed class . 
4168	1	a	but i'm right ? 
4169	3	a	yeah , you're right about the difference between a man and a woman , but not about the punch line to the joke , right ? the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman . . . is boobs ! 
4170	1	a	hey . do you remember the speeches that you gave ? 
4171	3	a	i do . both of them . 
4172	1	a	could i have a copy of one of them ? 
4173	3	a	no , no ! they would remember them . look , it doesn't matter what you say . it just matters that you're saying something that people care about . yeah ? all right ? here we go . watch this . 
4174	3	a	attention everybody ! attention please ! i have some very great news from corporate . we had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars ! 
4175	1	a	yeah ! 
4176	3	a	 congratulations . 
4177	3	a	you see that ? you see how they responded to me ? in that moment , i had them . 
4178	1	a	that is so great about the bonus ! 
4179	3	a	no , no ! it's not true . i was just talking so just go out there and say anything . they'll eat it up . they're a great audience . 
4180	1	a	excuse me ! may i have your attention please ? there has been an accident on 84 west . cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing . several cars have flipped . there is broken glass everywhere . several people are injured . 
4181	4	a	do we know anyone who was in the accident ? 
4182	1	a	brad pitt . also there will be no bonuses . 
4183	1	a	they are unrelated . 
4184	1	a	he will never act again . also , this branch is closing . 
4185	1	a	yes . 
4186	3	a	he's kidding . dwight was kidding and i don't know why because it wasn't funny . . . and it was just horrible . 
4187	3	a	yeah . 
4188	3	a	all right . everybody in the conference room now . let's go . let's do it . 
4189	4	a	you mean toastmasters ? 
4190	3	a	pam ! i'm public speaking . stop public interrupting me . actually , this would be good practice for your wedding toast . 
4191	4	a	yeah , the bride doesn't really do . . . have you ever been to a wedding ? 
4192	2	a	can i go ? 
4193	3	a	yes . good . jim taking the initiative . 
4194	2	a	so . uh . . . i am going on a trip . but not really sure where i'm going yet . it's kind of open-ended . so i was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions ? 
4195	2	a	what is that ? 
4196	2	a	i was thinking more like europe . or something like that . but , good second choice . 
4197	3	a	oh ho hokay . you know what ? that's not a toast . you're not standing up . 
4198	2	a	when did you go there ? 
4199	2	a	really for like how long ? 
4200	2	a	where do i want to go ? 
4201	3	a	okay , dwight . show us what you have learned today . 
4202	1	a	good morning , vietnam ! okay . you know what ? this isn't working . because um i'm not nervous in front of them . they're my subordinates . 
4203	2	a	no . we're not . 
4204	1	a	uh , yes you are . i'm assistant regional manager . 
4205	2	a	which means absolutely nothing . 
4206	1	a	michael , can you explain ? 
4207	3	a	well , it's mostly made up . so . . . 
4208	3	a	dwight is not going to do a job . it's sad . and they're expecting excellence because i did do such a good job . two years in a row . i killed . it was amazing . 
4209	3	a	confidence , dwight . 
4210	2	a	dwight . if you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go ? 
4211	1	a	i can travel anywhere except cuba . and i will travel to new zealand . and walk the 'lord of the rings' trail to mordor . and then i will hike mount doom . so . . . no . . . just leave me alone . 
4212	2	a	okay . just trying to get some advice on my trip . 
4213	1	a	oh please ! you're not taking any trip . 
4214	2	a	you know i majored in public speaking in college . 
4215	1	a	you did ? 
4216	2	a	mmmhmm . and the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self . and you are all about authority . 
4217	1	a	yes . i am . 
4218	2	a	the great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers . they were people of passion . so if you want to do well today , you got to do what they did . 
4219	1	a	which is ? 
4220	2	a	you've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists . many times . it's supposed to emphasize your point . 
4221	2	a	ok , i didn't actually major in public speaking . but , i did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators . like this one . originally given by benito mussolini . 
4222	2	a	ok , look . i know you are giving this speech on your own
4223	1	a	i'll glance at it . 
4224	3	a	it's time , dwight . the grim reaper is here .

4231	3	a	all right . you know what ? okay . no . no problem . you are lucky you have me here . i'm going to cover for you . all right ! 
4232	4	a	maybe we'll use a dj . that's the one thing roy's in charge of for this wedding but all he's managed to do is set a date . 
4233	4	a	ryan , you should be more sensitive . it's obvious she likes you and comments like that , they just . . . 
4234	3	a	i'm very sorry . i did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and i just thought you were speaking abnormally . . . . and now the black guy from the 'police academy' movies . a robot . michael winslow , anyone ? 
4235	3	a	car starting . all right , dwight schrute everyone .

4259	1	a	what ? something happened ? 
4260	3	a	oh ! this woman came in , sat down , ordered a drink . the bartender asked for her id which i thought was odd because i pegged her at like 35 . 
4261	1	a	weird . 
4262	3	a	yeah , it was weird . so , she was like 'i don't have my id , please give me one . ' and he was like 'i can't do that . i can't serve you . '
4263	1	a	con artist . 
4264	3	a	she might have been . so she says 'fine . i will go to my room . i will get my purse . i will come back . i'll show you my id . ' she hasn't come back yet . she's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar ! right ? 
4265	3	a	dwight gave a great speech . that's the word on the street anyway . and i entertained dwight to no end with my bar stories . so , i captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys . can you believe that ? a thousand guys ? 
4266	3	a	all right , listen up , please . dwight has a joke . 
4267	1	a	 stop it . two sailors walk into a bar . . .

4379	4	a	he's not coming out . he won't pick up the phone . 
4380	2	a	can't believe his mom dressed him like that , that's the real tragedy . 
4381	4	a	so , melissa . . . i met your mom a couple times . she's
4382	4	a	mmhmm . 
4383	1	a	uh , okay . but first , that's not my name . 
4384	1	a	well at least i'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school . so . . . 
4385	3	a	 yeah ? 
4386	3	a	oh , that's okay , she can keep those . 
4387	3	a	thank you . 
4388	3	a	you have to ask me that because you work for human resources . 
4389	3	a	well , sure , playing the field is great , don't get me wrong , but there's more to life than notches just on my bedpost . 
4390	3	a	tell me something honestly , do you . . . think . . . that it is too late for me to have kids ? 
4391	3	a	what about . . . 
4392	3	a	 . . . jan . kay . 
4393	3	a	 . . . or biologically . 
4394	3	a	thanks , that's , no , that . . . that really means a lot to me . hey , does sasha have a godfather , because i . . . 
4395	3	a	oh . . . kay . 
4396	4	a	sure . 
4397	4	a	you're welcome . 
4398	4	a	it's not too bad . i get to shred things sometimes , do you want to see ? 
4399	4	a	really ? 
4400	4	a	okay . um . . . here it is . don't put your fingers in there . cool huh ? 
4401	4	a	yeah , i get to do this like , every week . 
4402	4	a	i know . 
4403	3	a	yes , it is true . i , michael scott , am signing up with an online dating service . thousands of people have done it , and i am going to do it . i need a username . and . . . i have a great one . little kid lover . that way , people will know exactly where my priorities are at . 
4404	2	a	ohh , man , i would love to ! i can't tonight , but can i come over some other time ? 
4405	2	a	thanks , kev . uhm . . . i'm actually going on a date . 
4406	3	a	hey , uh , no , please ? you can't leave yet . there's still one more thing we need to do . 
4407	3	a	 you . . . who are on the road . . . must have a code . . . that you can live by . . . and so . . . become yourself . . . because the past . . . is just a goodbye . . . and teach . . . your children well . . . 
4408	2	a	why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play ? 
4409	4	a	i think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer . 
4410	4	a	my theory is that . . . 
4411	1	a	and they do , your parents , love you very much . 
4412	3	a	one more time . you . . . 
4413	1	a	the schrutes consider children very valuable . in the olden days , the women would bear many children , so we would have enough laborers to work the fields . and if it was an especially cold winter , and there weren't enough grains or vegetables , they would eat the weakest of the brood . they didn't eat the children . 
4414	3	a	didn't do background checks of the warehouse guys . well , i'm sure it'll be fine . 
4415	2	a	a7557962 . ' totally nonsense numbers , but you do what you have to do . 
4416	3	a	so , phil recruited me to sell these cards , and now i am recruiting you . 
4417	3	a	don't worry about phil . he drives a corvette . he is doing just fine . okay . calling cards are . . . the wave of the future . these things sell themselves . 
4418	3	a	you know what ? that's a nice attitude , ryan , i'm just helping you invest in your future , my friend . 
4419	3	a	yes ! thank you ! you will get rich quick . we all will ! 
4420	3	a	you know what , toby ? when the son of the deposed king of nigeria emails you directly , asking for help , you help ! his father ran the freaking country , okay ? . . . alright , so , raise your hand if you wanna get rich . alright . 
4421	2	a	no , um . how is this not a pyramid scheme ? 
4422	4	a	happy birthday michael . 
4423	3	a	oh ho ho ! what ? 
4424	4	a	i said happy birthday .

4566	2	a	is that michael ? 
4567	3	a	yeah , i've been pretty much skating my whole life . i thought about playing in the nhl , but , you're on the road so much . you got no time to spend with your wife and kids . and i really want a wife and kids . 
4568	4	a	i got it . 
4569	3	a	hey pam , all this stuff with kevin . . . um , it's pretty scary . and i'm thinking that uh , next time you're in the shower , you should check yourself out . you know , give yourself an exam . those things are like ticking time bags . alright ? think about it . 
4570	2	a	 . . . it's something to think about . 
4571	3	a	kevin . you heard anything yet ? 
4572	3	a	okay . well . live strong .

4580	3	a	well , apparently in the medicine community , negative means good . which makes absolutely no sense . in the real world community , that would . . . be . . . chaos . 
4581	3	a	okay , who's this from ? wowwwee , look at that ! jersey !

4590	4	a	michael's birthday was actually pretty cool . it was a good day . i don't know . . . it was a good day . 
4591	1	a	michael's birthday is hard for me because he gets very excited . but he's also under a lot of pressure , which builds up until he's ready to explode . as his right-hand man , it's my job to release that pressure so that he can enjoy himself , if only for a moment . 
4592	1	a	to think that a man's skin could turn on him . it's brilliant , 'cause you'd never expect it . most people think of their skin as an ally . makes me rethink having skin at all . 
4593	1	a	kevin malone , you're next . spit that out . spit . . . okay , come on , let's go . 
4594	2	a	you look cute today , dwight . 
4595	1	a	thanks , girl . 
4596	2	a	so , yesterday dwight found half a joint in the parking lot . which is unfortunate because as it turns out , dwight
4597	1	a	let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use , shall we ? you tell me who this sounds like: slow moving , inattentive , dull , constantly snacking , shows a lack of motivation . 
4598	1	a	i like the people i work with generally , with four exceptions . but someone committed a crime and i did not become a lackawanna county volunteer sheriff's deputy to make friends . and by the way , i haven't . 
4599	2	a	 i enjoy the tangy zip of miracle whip . 
4600	4	a	 jim does the best impressions . sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk and he'll just be someone else . like he'll go um , that's supposed to be phyllis . i can't do it as good as he can . 
4601	1	a	stop ! this is not kelly kapoor story hour . illegal drugs were consumed on company property , okay ? your ass is on the line , mister ! my ass is is on the line ! now i'm going to ask you again . what time did you go home last night ? 
4602	1	a	i didn't know that you were at a party on saturday night . 
4603	1	a	okay , i'm gonna need to search your car . give me you keys . 
4604	1	a	don't make me do this the hard way . 
4605	3	a	ry , is he bugging you ? dwight , dude , you gotta take a chill pill , man . it was one joint in the parking lot . you know , you're totally harshing the office mellow . 
4606	1	a	i can't stop this investigation . it is my job . 
4607	2	a	whoa . you are a volunteer . 
4608	1	a	i volunteered for this job . 
4609	2	a	and that's not the same . 
4610	1	a	it is my duty . . . 
4611	2	a	 volunteer duty . 
4612	1	a	 . . . to investigate the crime scene . i have six more interviews to go and then i will reveal what i know . 
4613	3	a	 narc ! 
4614	1	a	if you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job . 
4615	3	a	i wasn't attempting to compliment you . 
4616	1	a	well , you have . . . 
4617	3	a	uuf , well . . . 
4618	1	a	 . . . because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have . . . 
4619	3	a	 okay . . . 
4620	1	a	 . . . and i am very proud of being a narc . 
4621	3	a	why don't you just cool it , cool it dwight , please , god ! dude , where's my office ? i totally lost it , 'cause i was half-baked . smokin' doobies . doobie brothers , i was smokin' doobies with my brothers . peace out , seacrest ! 
4622	2	a	well , your office is behind you . 
4623	3	a	thanks . m-m-munchies . who wants some munchies ? 
4624	1	a	oscar visited mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral . what does that mean to a united states law enforcement officer ? he's a potential drug mule . 
4625	1	a	have you ever taken any illegal drugs ? 
4626	1	a	do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it ? 
4627	1	a	have you ever . . . pooped . . . a balloon ? 
4628	1	a	he sure left in a hurry . 
4629	1	a	i don't want to blow this . this is what all good law enforcement officers dream of . the chance to solve an actual crime . 
4630	1	a	do you know what this is ? 
4631	1	a	how do you know that ? 
4632	1	a	 dammit . 
4633	1	a	no , it's marijuana . 
4634	2	a	i'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you . 
4635	1	a	that's ridiculous , of course it wasn't me . 
4636	2	a	marijuana is a memory loss drug , so maybe you just don't remember . 
4637	1	a	i would remember . 
4638	2	a	well , how could you , if it just erased your memory ? 
4639	1	a	that's not how it works . 
4640	2	a	now how do you know how it works ? 
4641	1	a	knock it off , okay , i'm interviewing you . 
4642	2	a	no ! you said that i'd be conducting the interview when i walked in here . now exactly how much pot did you smoke ? 
4643	2	a	oh , um . . . why do you keep cc'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me ? 
4644	2	a	oh , hey stanley . uh , i was just doing an impression . 
4645	4	a	he does everyone in the office . 
4646	4	a	jinx ! buy me a coke . 
4647	2	a	oh . . . 
4648	4	a	no , no , no , no talking . jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke . those are the rules of jinx , and they are unflinchingly rigid . 
4649	4	a	sold out ? that has never happened in the history of jinx . 
4650	2	a	 c'mon ! 
4651	4	a	sorry , that's not my problem . 
4652	1	a	i know you're innocent , but i can't look like i'm treating you any differently . 
4653	1	a	where were you yesterday after work ? 
4654	3	a	uh-oh . uh-oh . who's he calling ? ratting somebody out . narc ! narc ! kevin ? 
4655	3	a	remember the narc bit ? uh-oh , who's in trouble ? 
4656	1	a	attention everyone . drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine . 
4657	3	a	waa . . . what ? what are you talking about ? 
4658	1	a	company policy . if drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours . 
4659	3	a	okay , attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled . instead , i will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection . 
4660	1	a	no you can't do that . 
4661	3	a	i can do that , it is my office . 
4662	1	a	no you cannot . it has to be official , and it
4663	3	a	hmmm . ha . alright . great . 
4664	1	a	kevin , what prescription drugs are you taking , besides rogaine ? 
4665	1	a	angela , what about you ? 
4666	1	a	you're not on
4667	1	a	good . 
4668	4	a	hey guys , what's going on ? 
4669	4	a	oh , okay . well , michael wants to see everyone in the conference room . but you know what ? we have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation . 
4670	3	a	it has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about . 
4671	3	a	no , uh , no . that was a test . i was testing you , and you all failed . miserably . when i said that dwight was a narc , how many of you defended him ? how many of you said , 'hey , you know what , he's right ? what he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs . '
4672	1	a	thank you , michael . 
4673	3	a	i am ridiculously anti-drug . so anti-drug that i am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion , or testing of any kind . 
4674	3	a	are these facts scaring you , or are they not ? 
4675	3	a	do you think that smoking drugs is cool ? do you think that doing alcohol is cool ? 
4676	3	a	okay , enough , enough , enough ! i have written down a list of illegal drugs . take a gander . how many of these are you familiar with ? 
4677	3	a	yes it is . 
4678	3	a	okay , you know what , toby ? pam , can you take this down ? in addition to toby's urine being tested , i would like to test his blood and his hair . 
4679	3	a	i can test anyone randomly , and i have chosen you randomly . 
4680	3	a	okay , eeny , meenie , miney , moe , is random . okay , you know what ? i'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives , or the lives of a loved one . yeah , pam . 
4681	4	a	i know that jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs . 
4682	3	a	really ? 
4683	4	a	uh , hmmm . 
4684	4	a	wow ! he really pulled out the big guns . fake crying . did not expect that . 
4685	3	a	the point i'm trying to make with all of this people is that i hate drugs . i hate them , and based upon what i have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as i do so you are going to have a drug test , and i am not . 
4686	1	a	no , you will be tested . 
4687	3	a	yes , i will not be . 
4688	1	a	you will be . that is the law according to the rules . 
4689	3	a	okay , well dwight just know that i've been very busy today and i got a lot of work to do and i wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and i don't even know if anything is going to come out , okay ? so good . thank you . 
4690	1	a	hi , linda . dwight schrute , assistant regional manager . you might remember testing my urine a few years back when i was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy . 
4691	1	a	mine was green . 
4692	1	a	i'm all better . 
4693	3	a	so i need you to do some work on the st . andrews account . i need your urine . i need some filing done . 
4694	1	a	what kind of filing ? 
4695	3	a	just forget it . just the urine . 
4696	1	a	that goes directly to the tester . 
4697	3	a	just . i need your urine . 
4698	1	a	like in a cup ? 
4699	3	a	yes in a cup , we're not animals , dwight . 
4700	1	a	for what purpose ? 
4701	3	a	it's none of your business . 
4702	1	a	then i refuse . 
4703	3	a	okay . alright . just , i went to an alicia keys concert , over the weekend , and i think i may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring . 
4704	1	a	are you serious ? 
4705	3	a	i need clean urine for the lady . 
4706	1	a	but that's illegal . 
4707	3	a	don't think of it that way . it's like , urine goes all over the place . you know , there's no controlling it . it just . . . goes
4708	1	a	not my urine . 
4709	3	a	a cup could find its way under the urine . it might be an accident . it happens . 
4710	1	a	were you forced to do drugs at this concert ? 
4711	3	a	no , just look . look . just . . . just fill up the cup . 
4712	1	a	i want him to have all the urine he needs . 
4713	1	a	i know that . don't you think i know that ? 
4714	3	a	dwight . well , i passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee . thank you very much . 
4715	1	a	that's great . 
4716	3	a	what's wrong ? where's your costume ? 
4717	1	a	it's a uniform and i turned it in today when i tendered my resignation . 
4718	3	a	why ? wha . . . 
4719	1	a	i took an oath when i was sworn in and i broke that oath today . 
4720	2	a	hi . 
4721	4	a	hey . 
4722	2	a	how much time do you have left on your break ? 
4723	4	a	ten minutes . 
4724	3	a	since you did such a good job with the investigation , i decided to pull a few strings . call in a few favors . and i've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch . 
4725	1	a	really ? 
4726	3	a	yes , sir . 
4727	1	a	that's fantastic because i've always felt that the security here sucked . 
4728	3	a	so you wanna ? thanks . 
4729	3	a	okay . 
4730	1	a	thank you , michael . very nice . great . can i have a gun ? 
4731	1	a	okay , i'll have to bring in my bow staff . 
4732	3	a	good . 
4733	1	a	 thank you , michael . 
4734	3	a	no . oh . uh . . . 
4735	1	a	i need to go over some details with you . 
4736	3	a	alright . well , thank you . 
4737	1	a	first of all , hank , how many orange traffic cones do you have ? 
4738	1	a	oh , god . 
4739	2	a	wow . what a terrible day to not be able to talk . dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the village people . why does he do the things that he does for michael ? i just don't get it . what is he getting out of that relationship ? 
4740	4	a	no . 
4741	2	a	yeah , i mean it's inevitable . i definitely overhear some wedding preparation , but i'm fine with it . she hears me arranging my social life . and we both have to hear dwight order deer urine over the internet , so it evens out . 
4742	4	a	yeah ? 
4743	4	a	oh , thanks ! 
4744	4	a	uh . . . 
4745	4	a	there are a few people i decided not to invite , and that might make things kind of awkward but . . . it's my wedding . and i don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy . 
4746	3	a	yes , thanks , fantastic sam's . adult cut plus . comes with a shampoo and blow dry . we're doing i . d . photos today . gotta represent . 
4747	1	a	oh ! what is on your face ? is that a disguise ? 
4748	1	a	clown paint . 
4749	1	a	i . d . badges are long overdue . security in this office park is a joke . last year , i came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag . i sat at my desk all day , with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch . can you imagine if i was deranged ? 
4750	3	a	that's a nice tie . 
4751	3	a	that is . . . who makes that ? 
4752	3	a	do you mind if i wear that for the photo ? 
4753	3	a	 what's the dealio ? 
4754	3	a	what's the problem ? 
4755	3	a	so what , you're having a little spat . i forget , are you guys dating ? 
4756	3	a	yes . 
4757	3	a	yeah ? 
4758	3	a	okay . 
4759	3	a	what do you know about conflict resolution ? your answer to everything is to get divorced . so . . . 
4760	3	a	okay . . . what ? 
4761	3	a	yeah , well . . . that's not gonna fly here . because in this office , it is till death do us part . . . assuming we don't get downsized . uh , pam , will you get angela and meet us in the conference room please ? 
4762	3	a	 a mediator's tool chest . okay , well , before we get started , you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict . my shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style . 
4763	3	a	no . okay , this is important . the first style is lose/lose . 
4764	3	a	just hold on , please ! okay , if we do lose/lose , neither of you gets what you want . do you understand ? you . . . you would both lose . now i need to ask you , do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation ? 
4765	3	a	win/win is number four and number five is win/win/win . the important difference here is with win/win/win , we all win . me too . i win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work . 
4766	3	a	 okay , since this is the disputed poster . now , one at a time , i want you to express your feelings using 'i' emotion language and no judging or 'you' statements . 
4767	3	a	come on , seriously , that ? 
4768	3	a	okay , okay . stop , stop , stop ! let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win . 
4769	4	a	win ! 
4770	3	a	yes . thank you , pam . how about angela makes the poster into a t-shirt , which oscar wears . that way , he can never see it and whenever she looks at oscar , she can see it . win/win/win . 
4771	3	a	okay . . . well , brainstorm . own the solution . 
4772	4	a	how about , angela can keep it up on tuesdays and thursdays ? 
4773	3	a	okay , that is called a compromise . and it is style 3 . and it is not ideal . to sum up , win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt , win/lose - take the poster down , compromise - tuesdays and thursdays . and the answer is . . . make the poster into a t-shirt ! win/win . 
4774	4	a	win . 
4775	3	a	 it is done ! 
4776	4	a	win
4777	4	a	hey , angela . i didn't have your zip code . 
4778	3	a	yes . 
4779	3	a	are those all the other complains ? 
4780	3	a	i would like to see those please . 
4781	3	a	you can't do that , huh ? huh , ok . now you and i have a conflict . i order you to give me that file . 
4782	3	a	okay . there ! no more conflict . i had to use win/lose on that . it was not pretty . all right . . . is that it ? 
4783	3	a	ohh . . . god . alright . why do i have to do everything ? 
4784	1	a	oh , he's sure . just shoot . 
4785	3	a	 this is from kevin . he says stanley uses his miracle whip without asking . meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright . creed . . . huh . duh , duh . creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist . 
4786	4	a	nice . 
4787	3	a	you will notice that not one of these complaints is against me . 
4788	3	a	oh , ok . there were a bunch of complaints about dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago . 
4789	1	a	whoa . . wha . . . wait . if someone has a problem with me , why would they withdraw it six months ago ? 
4790	4	a	 um . . . let's move on . i volunteer . did anyone have a problem with me ? 
4791	3	a	all right , pamela . come on down ! let's do it ! and . . . okay . just one complaint . actually , it has been withdrawn . so that is no help to us . next . 
4792	4	a	wait , what did it say ? 
4793	3	a	uh . . . 'does she have to plan her wedding on office time ? couldn't she do that at home ? ' who else ? why don't we just warm up first ? warm up emotionally , all right ? 
4794	4	a	i have this kind of big secret about angela . and i've been really nice to her . . . and i haven't told anyone . and what the hell ? ! 
4795	3	a	here is a kelly complaint: 'ryan never returns my calls . ' ugh , join the club . 
4796	3	a	 makin' progress . yes ? 
4797	2	a	dwight tried to kiss me . 
4798	3	a	what ? ! 
4799	2	a	and i didn't tell anyone because i'm not really sure how i feel about it . 
4800	1	a	that is not true . redact it . redact it ! 
4801	2	a	well , i'm not actually making a formal complaint . i just really think we should talk about it . 
4802	1	a	okay , question . when a name is withdrawn , does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in new york ? 
4803	3	a	stanley . 
4804	4	a	 hey . thanks for ratting me out ! 
4805	3	a	 you got a lot of anger under there buddy . come on start us out . unleash it . 
4806	4	a	i find that hard to believe . . . considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except bobblehead joe . 
4807	3	a	someone complained that the men's room is 'whites only' . stanley , you know that's not true . 
4808	3	a	okay , phyllis . you complained that angela's giving you dirty looks . and you tried to get off the party planning committee . 
4809	3	a	and . . . also , phyllis , stanley says that you cry too much , and that bugs him . 
4810	3	a	oh . . . ok . 
4811	4	a	i can't believe angela . i went against my better judgment , and i gave her a save the date . and now it turns out she complained about me to toby . 
4812	2	a	well , it was redacted . look , if she wants an invite , maybe she's just trying to be friends . 
4813	4	a	don't take her side . 
4814	2	a	 well , what does roy think about everything ? 
4815	4	a	i don't know . i try not to bother him about this kind of stuff . 
4816	2	a	you mean your thoughts and feelings ? 
4817	4	a	yeah . 
4818	2	a	yeah . . . 
4819	3	a	okay , well . . . all settled , then . 
4820	3	a	ok , ryan . you told toby that creed has a distinct old man smell ? 
4821	3	a	all right , kevin . you are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to angela that made her feel uncomfortable . solution: angela , you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to kevin that will make him uncomfortable . 
4822	2	a	hey . . . you know what , dwight ? maybe we should get our photo i . d . taken together . 
4823	1	a	that doesn't make any sense . 
4824	2	a	well , it saves time , you know . 'cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning . walk in together . perfect . 
4825	1	a	no . 
4826	1	a	i never smile if i can help it . showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates . when someone smiles at me , all i see is a chimpanzee begging for its life . 
4827	2	a	this came out really well . there you go . 
4828	1	a	this is humongous . i am not a security threat . . . 
4829	2	a	oh . 
4830	1	a	and my middle name is 'kurt' , not 'fart' . 
4831	2	a	what did i write ? 
4832	1	a	i have another complaint for jim's permanent file . 
4833	1	a	what box ? ! 
4834	3	a	uh . dwight . 
4835	1	a	ah . . . agh . . . dgh . . . ahh ! no , no ! four years of malfeasance unreported . this cannot stand . 
4836	3	a	okay ! calm down . 
4837	1	a	no ! you calm down ! who's side is toby on ? who's side are you on ? 
4838	3	a	hey , hey ! 
4839	1	a	him or me ? 
4840	3	a	stop . 
4841	1	a	him or me ? i cannot work with jim anymore . 
4842	3	a	okay . . . 
4843	1	a	either he goes , or i go . 
4844	3	a	dwight . . . 
4845	1	a	you choose ! 
4846	3	a	stop . . . 
4847	1	a	one of us is out of here by the end of today ! 
4848	3	a	oh . . . kay . . . 
4849	1	a	i am not bluffing ! 
4850	3	a	okay . 
4851	1	a	okay ? 
4852	3	a	yes . 
4853	1	a	do the right thing here , michael . okay , i have served you loyally for years . 
4854	3	a	mm-hmm . 
4855	1	a	i deserve this . you know i do ! 
4856	3	a	 you know your i . d . says you're a security threat ? 
4857	1	a	you have till five . 
4858	1	a	oh , look , jim . there's a sales manager position open in stamford . want me to call jan and tell her you're interested ? i could put in a good word for you , 'cause i'll still be working here . transfer ! transfer ! everybody ! transfer ! transfer ! transfer ! transfer ! 
4859	3	a	okay . . . you two , in the conference room with me . nobody leaves until we work this out . cage match ! 
4860	3	a	cage matches ? yeah , they work . how could they not work ? if they didn't work , everybody would still be in the cage . 
4861	3	a	okay , so dwight , in your own words - 'someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons . i suspect jim halpert . ' 'everyone has called me 'dwayne' all day . i think jim halpert paid them to . '
4862	2	a	 yes ! five bucks each . and it was totally worth it . 
4863	2	a	that actually took a while . i had to put , uh , more and more nickels into his handset , till he got used to the weight , and then i just . . . took 'em all out . 
4864	3	a	 'every time i typed my name , it said 'diapers' . '
4865	2	a	just a simple macro . you know , these actually don't sound that funny one after another . but he does deserve it , though . 
4866	3	a	by the end of the day , my desk was about two feet closer to the copier . '

4895	4	a	what ? ! 
4896	2	a	i'm the one who complained about you . 
4897	2	a	i . . . i didn't know that toby was gonna write it down . i was just venting .

4905	3	a	 one , two . . didn't say three , did i ? 
4906	3	a	but , i'm sort of an expert at photoshop , so it turned out fine in the end . when people work together , there is going to be conflict . you can't outrun your problems . 
4907	2	a	 hey , pam . . . it's jim . um , i have a doctor's appointment in the city . so i probably won't be in till the late afternoon . just thought i'd let you know . okay , bye . 
4908	2	a	oh , thanks . 
4909	3	a	and that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing . but here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage . and that is something toby will never understand . 
4910	2	a	excuse me . how long is the wait for a table for two ? 
4911	1	a	i would never , ever serve you . not in a million , billion years . 
4912	4	a	it's a nice tux .

4914	4	a	come on , it'll be fun , and besides , i'm a roulette expert . 
4915	1	a	impossible . roulette is not a game of skill , it is a game of chance . 
4916	2	a	i can always kind of win at roulette . 
4917	1	a	oh , really ? mmm-hmm . 
4918	2	a	yeah . 
4919	1	a	how would you do that ? 
4920	2	a	mind control . 
4921	1	a	 you can't be serious . are you serious ? 
4922	2	a	ever since i was a little kid , like , eight or nine , i could sort of control things with my mind . 
4923	1	a	i don't believe you . continue . 
4924	2	a	it was just little thing , you know , like i could make something shake or i could make a marble fall off the counter . you know , just little things . 
4925	1	a	 that's ridiculous . you know what ? uh . . . why don't you move that coat rack ? excuse me , everyone ! attention in the office , please . jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence . go ahead . 
4926	2	a	okay , i'll try . 
4927	1	a	oh , my god . 
4928	3	a	i try not to think of it as lagging behind . it's more of a david-and-goliath thing . 
4929	3	a	top 80 percent ! 
4930	3	a	yeah ? 
4931	3	a	jan , listen , i promise that i will kick it up a notch . bam ! 
4932	3	a	emeril . oh , actually , while i have you , not that i have you or have ever had you , but we're having our casino night tonight and i think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here . 
4933	3	a	i am , but you are the eva peron to my cesar chavez . 
4934	3	a	oh , come on . come on . 
4935	3	a	you know , it'd be fun . i can hear it in your voice . you need a break . 
4936	3	a	jan and i understand each other . the romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being , but we've remained good friends . good friends with privileges . not now , some day . 
4937	3	a	okay , everybody . tonight's event is to benefit the boy scouts of america . 
4938	3	a	well , they need our money . they don't have cookies like the girl scouts . 
4939	3	a	well , oscar , if you don't like it , then you should concentrate on winning . because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice . and they will get a mini-fridge compliments of vance refrigeration . 
4940	1	a	yes ! 
4941	3	a	so get your charities in to pam . i , for example , am playing for comic relief . 
4942	2	a	that doesn't exist anymore . 
4943	3	a	comedy is very much alive , as are homeless people . 
4944	4	a	no , they stopped making that show . 
4945	3	a	well , then , they need our money more than ever . 
4946	3	a	oh , and another fun thing . we , at the end of the night , are going to give the check to an actual group of boy scouts . right , toby ? we're gonna . . . 
4947	2	a	i think you mean the aid to afghanistan . 
4948	3	a	no , i mean afghanistanis with aids . 
4949	3	a	what ? 
4950	3	a	that's a dog . 
4951	4	a	no , that's afghan .

4953	1	a	wait , canine aids ? 
4954	3	a	no . humans with aids . 
4955	2	a	guys , the afghanistananies . 
4956	3	a	okay , you know what ? no . no . aids is not funny . believe me , i have tried . 
4957	3	a	there are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians , jfk , aids , the holocaust . the lincoln assassination just recently became funny . 'i need to see this play like i need a hole in the head . ' and i hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious aids joke . it's one of my dreams . 
4958	2	a	what are you doing ? 
4959	4	a	oh , nothing . 
4960	2	a	till death do us rock . '
4961	4	a	they're wedding bands . 
4962	2	a	oh . 
4963	4	a	roy was supposed to pick the band , but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now . 
4964	2	a	wait , wait , where you going ? i mean , even if you don't hire a band , you still have to watch the bands . pam , these are people who have never given up on their dreams . i have great respect for that . and , yes , they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams . 
4965	4	a	there's a kiss cover band in here . 
4966	2	a	let's do it . 
4967	4	a	i'm pretty happy these days . i'm getting married soon and i'm getting along with everybody at work .

5130	1	a	the planet caprica . 
5131	3	a	where the hell is that ? 
5132	1	a	it's from battlestar galactica .

5140	3	a	our numbers are down , yes , but we have a heck of a crew here in scranton . hardworking , motivated , dynamic . every single last one of them . they follow my lead . i sort of set the tone . and it doesn't hurt that my ex works for corporate . jan loves this branch , and i think that's really more than half the battle . 
5141	2	a	 you have no idea how long i've wanted to do that . 
5142	4	a	me too . . . . i think we're just drunk .

5153	3	a	i would have never called him that if i knew . you don't . . . you don't call retarded people 'retards' . it's bad taste . you call your friends 'retards' when they're acting retarded . and i consider oscar a friend . 
5154	3	a	listen man , i am so sorry . i had no idea . 
5155	2	a	i can't say whether dunder mifflin paper is less flammable , sir , but i can assure that it is certainly not more flammable .

5164	3	a	can you tell who's gay and who's not ? 
5165	1	a	of course . 
5166	3	a	what about oscar ? 
5167	1	a	absolutely not . 
5168	3	a	well , he
5169	1	a	well , he's not dressed in women's clothes , so . . . 
5170	3	a	 there could be others . . . i need to know . i don't want to offend anybody else . 
5171	1	a	you could assume everyone is , and not say anything offensive . 
5172	3	a	yeah , i'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay . 
5173	3	a	hey , what about angela ? she's hard and severe . she could be a gay woman . 
5174	1	a	i really don't think so . 
5175	3	a	i don't know , i can imagine her with another woman , can't you ? 
5176	3	a	do some research . find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them . 
5177	1	a	jim told me you could buy gay-dar online . 
5178	3	a	that's ridiculous . 
5179	1	a	yeah probably . he didn't tell the truth a lot . 
5180	3	a	 let's call him and get the website . 
5181	1	a	definitely . 
5182	2	a	what's gay-dar ? 
5183	3	a	well , they're sold out . 
5184	1	a	damn . i'll try brookstone .

5188	0	a	ok . who put my calculator in jello ? good one . but uh , seriously , guys who did this ? seriously guys , who did this ? i need to know who put my calculator in jello , or i'm gonna lose my frickin' mind ! 
5189	3	a	i watch the l word . i watch , queer as f*** , so . . . 
5190	3	a	what ? what does that even . . . 
5191	3	a	well , gay pride , right ? gay pride parade ? it's not like gay . . . shame festival . 
5192	3	a	i think angela might be gay . could oscar and angela be having a gay affair ? maybe ! is that what this is about ? 
5193	3	a	i don't kn--
5194	3	a	anything's possible . 
5195	3	a	 well , i'm not gay jan , and you should know that better than anybody ! 
5196	3	a	the company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100 , 000 years of being weirded out by gays . 
5197	3	a	trick question ! cause you can't always tell , so . . . how would i know . is that the right answer ? 
5198	4	a	michael , dwight's looking at gay pornography on his computer . 
5199	1	a	uh , michael knows pam . he asked me to do this just for him . he has his own reasons . 
5200	3	a	 nothing wrong with this stuff . at all . this is fine . you know what . gay porn , straight porn , it's all goooooood ! i don't particularly get into this . but uh , you know what . i totally see the merit ! and actually . . . it is quite beautiful . 
5201	1	a	ah damn pop-ups . 
5202	3	a	 all right , everybody in the conference room ! i don't care if you are gay , or straight , or a lesbian , or overweight ! just get in here ! right now ! 
5203	3	a	did you know that gay used to mean happy ? when i was growing up it meant lame . and now it means a man , who makes love . . . to other men . 
5204	3	a	who should be the judges and juries of our society ? 
5205	1	a	i think all the other office gays should identify themselves , or i will do it for them . 
5206	1	a	what about phyllis ? she makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine ! 
5207	3	a	that's great . congratulations phyllis . that is great , and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing ! see ? everybody has a chance ! 
5208	3	a	but still , phyllis , in college ? did you ever experiment with other women ? a lot of women do ! 
5209	3	a	 right ! and i take that as a compliment . 
5210	3	a	well , i just like to look good ok , so ---
5211	3	a	no , i am just coming out myself . i am coming out hetero ! 
5212	3	a	no no no . the only signal that i am sending is:
5213	3	a	look , if i was gay , i would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen . i would be leading the parade covered in feathers , and just . . . i would be waving that rainbow flag . 
5214	3	a	 . . . and i just don't care who sees it , doesn't bother me ! 
5215	3	a	all right , um . . . sorry . 
5216	3	a	 i'm sorry i called you faggie . you're not faggie . you're a a good guy . 
5217	1	a	michael appears to be gay too . and yet he is my friend . i guess i do have a gay friend . 
5218	3	a	 oh come on ! dwight ! come on , man ! 
5219	3	a	i am glad that today spurred social change . that's part of my job as regional manager . but you know what ? even if it didn't , at least we put this matter to bed . . . . that's what she said . or he said . 
5220	3	a	oh , there's gill . oscar's roommate . i wonder if he knows ?

5249	4	a	what was oprah about ? 
5250	3	a	angelina jolie was on . and she adopted a baby from asia , and she said that it changed her life . and that really inspired me . so , i want you to look into seeing how much a little chinese baby would cost . 
5251	4	a	that's a really big decision . 
5252	3	a	i know . 
5253	4	a	maybe you should wait before you adopt . 
5254	3	a	well . . . 
5255	4	a	or not adopt . 
5256	3	a	just do it , okay ? 
5257	4	a	roy's sister looked into it , and the application alone costs a thousand dollars . 
5258	3	a	um . . . find out if there's a cheaper , less expensive baby out there , okay ? 
5259	4	a	you know , she also said the waiting list is like eight months . 
5260	3	a	eight months ? 
5261	4	a	yeah . 
5262	3	a	i don't even know if i'll want a baby in eight months . 
5263	4	a	you probably won't . 
5264	3	a	you know what , pam ? if in ten years , i haven't had a baby , and you haven't had a baby . . . 
5265	4	a	no , michael .

5616	3	a	well , i guess it's time , that i turn over the keys , to the famous sebring . 
5617	1	a	 no thank you .

5641	1	a	 i'll do anything ! anything ! i'll do your laundry for a month ! for a year !

5646	3	a	you can get up . get up . and you can hug it out , bitch . 
5647	3	a	hug it out , bitch . that is what men say to each other , after a fight . they hug it out , and doing so , the just . . . let it go . and walk away . and they're done . not a good idea to say that to a woman however . i have found . it doesn't translate . 
5648	3	a	okay . 
5649	1	a	hey . is everything okay ? 
5650	3	a	it is not your business , dwight . 
5651	1	a	if the branch is in trouble , there are things you can do . 
5652	3	a	what do you know about management , dwight ? 
5653	1	a	i know that we need to cut costs . we could fire meredith . that's a big cost . 
5654	3	a	i'm not firing anyone . 
5655	1	a	creed might be living here , we could charge him rent . 
5656	3	a	 . . . what ? 
5657	3	a	okay . here we go . everybody , you know what ? it dawned on me we were all in there watching a movie together before we were so rudely interrupted , let's get back in there . come on . movie monday ! come on , stanley let's go . 
5658	3	a	ryan ? 
5659	3	a	okay , well , we had scheduled this time to watch a movie together , so i guess i will just go play some online scrabble . 
5660	1	a	the schrutes are a very loyal breed . but i also have mannheim blood from my german grandmother . and the mannheims knew when to cut and run . no sense going down with a losing regime . but the schrute blood . . . it's amazing that when these two bloods mix , the whole thing didn't explode . 
5661	3	a	so , she sleeps with him , but she is still in love with the head surgeon , um , the mcdreamy guy , and she starts crying , but the dorky doctor , he's in love with her . . . 
5662	4	a	dunder mifflin , this is pam . . . . uh , sure , i'll get him for you . it's jan for you . 
5663	3	a	really ? 
5664	4	a	yeah . 
5665	4	a	i may have a few weeks ago faked a call from jan in order to get out of a synopsis of , i think it was , navy: ncis . since then , michael's been suspicious . 
5666	2	a	 oh ? someone's left out in the open , taking a little siesta . not smart . yes ! finally killed you . . . 
5667	2	a	hey , jan . 
5668	2	a	 pretty good . 
5669	2	a	things are a little bit . . . different here in stamford . it's not bad .

5671	3	a	oh , it's okay , i'm going down . 
5672	3	a	all right , i'll be right back .

5685	3	a	i am like bette midler in for the boys . gotta keep the troops entertained . 
5686	4	a	 with cream and sugar ? 
5687	3	a	 all right . 
5688	3	a	oookay . let me see if i have his cell . is this the only reason you are calling , jan ? or does somebody miss me ? 
5689	3	a	oh , wow . 
5690	3	a	attention , everybody . i just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that i should know first . my old boss ed truck has died . 
5691	3	a	yes , i am . it's very sad . because he was my boss . 
5692	3	a	that's right , you worked with him . so did creed . well , i'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by . cheer me up . 
5693	3	a	so did you hear the news ? 
5694	4	a	the news that you just announced ? that ed died ? 
5695	3	a	yeah . 
5696	4	a	is there anything i can do ? 
5697	3	a	oh , gosh , what can anybody do , really ? it's . . . pssssh . . . . he was almost 70 . circle of life . 
5698	4	a	yeah . 
5699	4	a	oh . okay . 
5700	3	a	yeah . mmmmmm . 
5701	4	a	 okay . 
5702	2	a	oh yeah , definitely . 
5703	0	a	 suck up ! josh , did you hear what i said ? 
5704	2	a	what's up ? 
5705	2	a	oh . 
5706	2	a	mmm , that's where you're wrong . i'm your project supervisor today , and i have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require . so , i think we should go get some . now , please . 
5707	3	a	yeah . must really have you thinkin' . 
5708	3	a	the older you get , the bigger the chance is you're gonna die . you knew that . 
5709	3	a	what ? 
5710	1	a	really ? 
5711	3	a	oh my god . 
5712	1	a	that is the way to go . instant death . very smart . 
5713	1	a	you're thinking of a chicken . 
5714	3	a	that is just not the way a dunder mifflin manager should go , i'm sorry . alone , out of the blue , and not even have his own head to comfort him . 
5715	3	a	 so , i'm not exactly sure how to say this . . . 
5716	1	a	ed was decapitated . 
5717	3	a	what are you doing ? 
5718	1	a	you said you didn't know how to say it . 
5719	3	a	i didn't . . . he was driving on the road and he went under a truck . and that's when his head was separated from the rest of him . and i will let you know more as soon as i find out . 
5720	1	a	hey . 
5721	1	a	if my head ever comes off , i would like you to put it on ice . 
5722	3	a	i don't understand . we have a day honoring martin luther king , but he didn't even work here . 
5723	3	a	you really don't get it , do you ? you don't understand these people . that is the last thing that they would want is a day off . 
5724	3	a	 a statue . 
5725	3	a	yeah . 
5726	3	a	well , i think it would be very realistic , it would look just like him . 
5727	3	a	we could have his eyes light up , we could have his arms move . . . 
5728	1	a	that is not a statue , that is a robot . 
5729	3	a	i think that is a great way to honor ed . 
5730	1	a	and how big do you want this robot ? 
5731	3	a	life-size . 
5732	1	a	mm , no . better make it two-thirds . easier to stop if it turns on us . 
5733	3	a	well , we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company , jan . 
5734	3	a	mm hm . 
5735	3	a	oh do you ? you know who wished they could get back to work is ed truck . 
5736	3	a	but ed truck can't because he is---
5737	3	a	dead . 
5738	1	a	look i gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us . 
5739	3	a	that's perfect . 
5740	2	a	okay , that is a 'no' on the on the west side market . 
5741	2	a	wow . never pegged you for a quitter . 
5742	2	a	really ? 
5743	0	a	hey . what are we doing ? what's the game ? i want in .

5747	2	a	and then we checked the fax machine . 
5748	0	a	did you check your . . . butt ? 
5749	3	a	oohh . . . can you imagine how much blood there was ? if it happened right here , it would reach all the way to reception . probably get on pam . 
5750	3	a	what ? 
5751	3	a	well , you know what ? i didn't wanna hear about it either , stanley , but i did and now i can't stop picturing it . he leaves work , he's on his way home . . . wham ! his cappa is detated from his head ! 
5752	3	a	well , you know what ? there's something wrong with you . there is something wrong with everybody in here . because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it , you don't wanna think about it , you just wanna get back to work !

5787	3	a	well , i'm sorry to inconvenience you , meredith . but that is what you do when things die . you honor them . toby killed this bird . and now we are going to honor it . 
5788	3	a	no , no , no ! that's enough ! you know what ? this bird is dead . he died alone . the least you can do is be there for him now . find a box for him . 
5789	2	a	nice ! 
5790	2	a	sounded good . 
5791	3	a	it's okay . it's okay . shh . . . yes , i know , i know . it's been a tough day , but it's good to let it show . 
5792	1	a	 argh . . . gah ! 
5793	3	a	what are . . . what are you doing ? 
5794	1	a	what ? no , this is about the right size . 
5795	3	a	no , god , no it's not ! what is the matter with you ? is that the beak ! ? 
5796	1	a	i'm sorry , i grew up on a farm . we slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon . my grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum . it would have fit if he had given me another minute . 
5797	1	a	i need a box . i need a box . a small box . . . not too confining . 
5798	4	a	is it for the bird ? 
5799	1	a	yeah . 
5800	4	a	i have it covered . 
5801	1	a	oh , thank you . 
5802	4	a	if you wanna do something for the funeral . . . 
5803	1	a	yes , please . 
5804	4	a	maybe you could play a song on your recorder . 
5805	1	a	excellent . 
5806	4	a	do you have it with you ? 
5807	1	a	always . 
5808	4	a	did i wake up this morning thinking i'd be throwing together a bird funeral ? you never can tell what your day here is gonna turn into . 
5809	2	a	where'd i find what ? 
5810	2	a	i called the manufacturer , who referred me to distributor , who referred me to the vending machine company , who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door . 
5811	3	a	glad you could all make it . 
5812	3	a	dwight , do you have the box ? 
5813	4	a	actually , i have it . 
5814	3	a	you made this ? wow . that's . . . that's very nice . 
5815	4	a	i'd also like to say a few words if that's okay . 
5816	3	a	yes . 
5817	4	a	what do we know about this bird ? you might think , 'not much . it's just a bird . ' but we do know some things . we know it was a local bird . maybe it's that same bird that surprised oscar that one morning with a special present from above . 
5818	4	a	and we know how he died . flying into the glass doors . but you know what ? i don't think he was being stupid . i think he just really , really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song . 
5819	1	a	he's not a songbird . 
5820	3	a	shhh . 
5821	4	a	an impression , then . lastly , we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died , but of course , we all know that doesn't mean he was alone . because i'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much . he will not be forgotten . 
5822	4	a	 just smile for me and let the day begin . you are the sunshine that lights my heart within . . . on the wings of love . . . 
5823	3	a	society teaches us that having feelings and crying is bad and wrong . well , that's baloney , because grief isn't wrong . there is such a thing as good grief . just ask charlie brown . 
5824	1	a	let's get back to work . 
5825	2	a	umm . . . sure . 
5826	2	a	 he's so cute . 
5827	2	a	that's okay . oh , no , it's not . i'm sorry , is that your husband in the tub with him ? 
5828	2	a	sounds good . 
5829	3	a	oh , wow . he . . . 
5830	3	a	does his family know ? 
5831	3	a	but i'm the first in the office ? 
5832	3	a	okay , yes , sure , i will do that . . . 
5833	3	a	 . . . 'cause i'm the first to to find out . nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them . well , good . how are you holding up ? want me to come over ? 
5834	3	a	ed truck died . and it blows . they say that with grief , time makes it worse , which is bad for me because i found out before anybody so i've had more time to be sad . 
5835	1	a	attention , everyone . as you know , ed truck is dead . if you have any contact information on rolodex files or in microsoft outlook , remove it now . also , if you have any photographs , pam will make her shredder available during lunch . that is all . 
5836	1	a	remembering the dead doesn't help anybody . the way to best honor them is to figure out what killed them and prevent that thing from killing anyone ever again . in this case , some sort of steel exoskeleton to protect the neck , or else a device that allows the head to live separately from the body . i'm working on both . 
5837	3	a	i would like you all to clear your schedules this afternoon , because i am telling corporate to send in a grief counselor . we need to find out what is blocking you . and that way , we'll be able to honor ed the way he deserves to be honored . may he rest in peace . 
5838	3	a	what was that , kevin ? 
5839	3	a	no , you said something , didn't you ? 
5840	3	a	you think that's funny . 
5841	3	a	you are disgusting . 
5842	1	a	michael , no need to call corporate . we are supposed to use toby . he's trained as a grief counselor . 
5843	3	a	no , that can't be right . 
5844	3	a	well , then i guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world , doesn't it ? 
5845	4	a	hi . 
5846	4	a	well , i will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone i've never met . 
5847	4	a	closer to the epicenter , i guess . 
5848	3	a	you're ruining it , already . they should not be given the choice . 
5849	3	a	wow . wow . no . no . you are the most heartless , soulless person i've ever met . 
5850	3	a	i found an exercise in toby's binder that he managed to miss , that involves screening the part of you that says , 'i don't wanna do that . i don't wanna talk about that . that is too private . ' here's how it works . i'm going to throw you this ball . 
5851	4	a	really ? 
5852	4	a	wow , i thought that was supposed to be , like , next month . 
5853	4	a	yeah , i'd love to see them . oh , and tell them i say , 'congratulations . '
5854	4	a	i should probably head back in . 
5855	4	a	but , umm , thanks for the break . 
5856	4	a	michael once told me that home alone is the saddest movie ever . when i asked him why , he said , 'because the whole family forgets the kid at home . there is nothing funny about that . '
5857	3	a	that's . . . hold it , hold it , hold it . start , like , right in there . just dig . 
5858	1	a	ow ! god ! 
5859	3	a	okay , give it to me . you don't know what you're doing . all right . 
5860	3	a	nothing . let's just . . . all right . guys , do you have a box we could use ? 
5861	1	a	brain teaser . i have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel . what are they ? 
5862	1	a	no , i said one of them is not a nickel . 
5863	1	a	ok . a man and his son get into a car accident . they are rushed to the hospital . the doctor says , there is no way i can operate on this boy , . . . 
5864	1	a	a man is found hanging from the ceiling . . . 
5865	1	a	a hunter . 
5866	1	a	damn it ! 
5867	3	a	uhhh . . . nothing . 
5868	3	a	yeah , nothing . how was your day ? 
5869	3	a	wow . well . ok . i don't care how your day was either , jan . i was just asking you because you asked me . why do you set me up like that ? 
5870	3	a	i worked . and then i went home to my condo . and carol came over . and then we had sex . is that what you want to hear ? 
5871	3	a	never ever , ever sleep with your boss . i am so lucky that jan and i only got to second base . 
5872	4	a	hi . 
5873	4	a	oh , i don't know if i'm . . . 
5874	4	a	it's weird . jan use to treat michael like he was a ten year old , but lately it's like he's five . 
5875	1	a	so you excited ? 
5876	1	a	very excited ? 
5877	1	a	extremely excited ? . . . just very ? that's cool . 
5878	1	a	i am very excited . ryan hasn't made a sale yet , but more importantly , he hasn't made an ally yet . is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like jim was ? or is he going to join the dwight army of champions ? 
5879	1	a	when you are ready to see the sales office , the sales office will present itself to you . your journey begins now . 
5880	2	a	what ? 
5881	2	a	is it ? 
5882	2	a	no , i didn't . i took back my chair that you took from me , but i didn't take your chair . 
5883	2	a	so i guess i can't get up . 
5884	3	a	hey koselli , the kos . cosby . hey hey hey . i love jello pudding pops . my son , theo , loves jello pudding pops too . 
5885	1	a	do you know where we are , temp ? 
5886	1	a	i hold in my hand , a beet seed . take it . ah ! when . . . damn it . 
5887	0	a	hey , big tuna , can i talk to you for a second . 
5888	2	a	sure . 
5889	0	a	can you stand up ? and talk to me over there ? 
5890	0	a	i'm acting my heart out here . 
5891	0	a	yeah , really . you asked for my help , so i helped . 
5892	4	a	once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels . it's really not a big deal . to some people it is . 
5893	3	a	productivity is important but how can i be productive if i have this one little thing in my brain ? that i cannot get out . and that one little thing is a soft pretzel . so i'm just going to have my soft pretzel , then i'll get to work , and i'll be super productive . look out for me . 
5894	3	a	 oh , shhh . . . come on . 
5895	1	a	and just as you have planted your seed in the ground , i'm going to plant my seed in you . 
5896	1	a	smells pretty bad , doesn't it ? 
5897	1	a	it's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away . 
5898	1	a	oh hey , i forgot something in my car . i'll be right back . 
5899	3	a	uh huh . 
5900	3	a	 hey , hey , hey ! phyllis , what are you doing ? 
5901	3	a	no , i think you're cutting in line . 
5902	3	a	no , i'm not going to settle down . 
5903	3	a	get in the back please . 
5904	3	a	boooooo . thank you . . that's right . 
5905	1	a	congratulations resourceful salesman . you have passed the second challenge . welcome to schrute farm . 
5906	2	a	 love me , love me , say that you love me , fool me , fool me ,

5910	0	a	i don't care 'bout anything but you . . . what ever happened to those guys ? 
5911	4	a	michael . 
5912	3	a	no cuts . oh , pam . just the woman i'd like to see . you read my mind . 
5913	4	a	great ! i thought you could use this time to authorize some checks . 
5914	3	a	i thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while i go to the bathroom . you're an angel . 
5915	4	a	hey , why don't you just go up to your office , get some work done , and i'll just bring you a pretzel . 
5916	3	a	because i like them a certain way , and if it gets screwed up , then whole thing is blown . 
5917	4	a	you know , i just think it's really important that you be productive today . 
5918	3	a	pam , productivity starts with patience and determination . i'll be back . 
5919	1	a	it is time for your next test . you have planted the beet seed . you have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness . 
5920	1	a	you know what your problem is ? you know why you haven't made any sales ? cause you think you know everything . you have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things . are you ready to learn ? are you ready for the final test ? 
5921	1	a	come on ! 
5922	3	a	hi . please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left . 
5923	3	a	thank god . 
5924	3	a	is there anyway that you could do all , all of them ? 
5925	3	a	all right ! thank you ! 
5926	1	a	please be seated . 
5927	1	a	pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground . 
5928	1	a	yes . 
5929	1	a	mose is my cousin and he lives here . he will always be my best friend . unless things go well with ryan today in which case , i won't hang out with mose so much anymore . 
5930	1	a	what is the greatest danger facing dunder mifflin ? 
5931	1	a	wrong . flash floods . what is the true cause of robert mifflin's suicide ? 
5932	1	a	wrong . he hated himself . what is the dharma initiative ? 
5933	1	a	final question , young ryan howard . what is michael scott's greatest fear ? 
5934	1	a	wrong . he's not afraid of anything . also , i would have accepted snakes . fear is what it's all about . you cannot sell while undergoing fear . you need to vanquish fear ! one must wrestle fear to the ground . you will now wrestle my cousin mose . 
5935	1	a	wrestle him to the ground . 
5936	1	a	ryan . don't . ryan ! you don't have to wrestle him . just get in the coffin . ryan ? 
5937	1	a	where are all the animals ? 
5938	1	a	ryan , come on . i am sorry . i am sorry . mose is sorry too . look , he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon . and look , something he whittled . 
5939	1	a	you still mad ? it's just jim and i didn't get along , and i didn't want it to be that way again . you know , i wanted us to be a team . an unstoppable team that competed against other teams . 
5940	1	a	screwgun . the sales call ! 
5941	3	a	mr . kosseli . hey hey hey , the cos . what's going on ? do we have a deal ? deal or no deal ? let's make a deal . so what is the deal ? 
5942	1	a	establish time frames . keep the phrase 'real dollars' in their head . and always keep the power in the conversation . that's why you're losing them on the cold calls . cause you say the word please too much . 
5943	1	a	michael always said , k . i . s . s . keep it simple , stupid . great advice , hurts my feelings every time . 
5944	1	a	good . 
5945	1	a	right . 
5946	1	a	uh huh .

5952	1	a	they did not . they didn't have to say it to your face . 
5953	4	a	dunder mifflin , this is pam . oh , hi jan . he's , uh , on a sales call . no message ? bye , jan .

5987	4	a	i don't know . it felt far . 
5988	2	a	yeah . i have a question for you . 
5989	4	a	what ? 
5990	2	a	how many words per minute does the average person type ? 
5991	4	a	i type 90 . 
5992	2	a	shut up . mavis beacon doesn't even type 90 . 
5993	4	a	it's true . 
5994	2	a	ok , i said average .

6003	4	a	so ok . i'm watching the movie , by myself . . .

6009	4	a	that movie is so scary ! 
6010	2	a	i know ! 
6011	4	a	but i'm holding on because i keep waiting for sandra bullock to show up . 
6012	2	a	no way . how do you confuse 28 days with 28 days later ? 
6013	4	a	because i got it at blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box . 
6014	2	a	no , you're making this up ! 
6015	4	a	would i make that up ? 
6016	2	a	yes . fancy new beesley would make that up . new apartment , new stories . 
6017	4	a	oh , yeah , in my fancy new apartment . i have one bedroom , one bathroom , and a closet .

6020	2	a	wow , you got totally taken for a ride beesley .

6023	4	a	three kitchens ? 
6024	2	a	yes ! how are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen ? 
6025	4	a	 hey , ryan , are you ok ? 
6026	2	a	pam ? 
6027	2	a	pam ? 
6028	4	a	um . ok , bye .

6032	4	a	you have to go ? 
6033	2	a	yeah , uh , well .

6035	2	a	ok . 
6036	4	a	i mean , yeah . 
6037	2	a	yeah . bye pam . 
6038	4	a	bye jim . 
6039	3	a	well , that's really not the way i roll , because sometimes i'm in the zone , and sometimes i'm in the zoning out . 
6040	3	a	do you want me to go on amazon and order you a slang dictionary ? cause i'll do it . 
6041	3	a	yes , big if . 
6042	3	a	a woman spurned . 
6043	4	a	it's like mommy and daddy are fighting . except mommy outranks daddy and mommy is way scarier . 
6044	1	a	take a good look at this boy . . . 
6045	3	a	i always do . 
6046	1	a	 . . . because you are never going to see him again . 
6047	3	a	if you lay a finger . . . 
6048	1	a	today is ryan's first sales call and i am bringing this boy home a full-grown man . 
6049	3	a	would you look at that ? damn it , dwight ! come on . 
6050	4	a	dwight is taking ryan on a sales call today . so if we find ryan's body in a heavily-wooded area tomorrow , i owe jim $30 . it's an old bet , but a deal's a deal . 
6051	1	a	i once saw a movie called 'training day' . it starred an african-american and ethan hawke . in it , the african-american trains ethan hawke with various tests and trials . today , ryan is ethan hawke , and i am the african-american . 
6052	1	a	get in the car . 
6053	1	a	don't you realize the key is inside you ? 
6054	1	a	no , but seriously , your ears are the key . 90% of a good sales call is listening , only 10% is talking . 
6055	1	a	get in the car . get . . . get in the car . 
6056	1	a	sales is not all in here . it's also in here . 
6057	1	a	 you know , selling , typing , dialing . 
6058	1	a	what is that in your ear ? a tiny beet seed . you need to clean your ears better . 
6059	3	a	9:00 to 10:00 , checked in with receptionist . met with jan , re: log . lost log . found log . ' '10:00 to 11:00 , light salad , three points . ' that's on the wrong page . 
6060	4	a	hey , let's focus today . make today all about focus . i'll help you . 
6061	3	a	okay . that sounds good . yes . actually , today's a good day to do that . 
6062	4	a	yeah . 
6063	3	a	what makes them so good ? 
6064	3	a	i mean , they're just dough twisted up with some candy . they taste so good in my mouth . 
6065	2	a	see , that's weird . 
6066	0	a	yo , mama ! ask me how bad i wanted to bone jennifer grey . 
6067	2	a	i saw the movie . i just don't know every line from the film . 
6068	0	a	seriously , you guys , ask me . 
6069	0	a	let's just say , me and jennifer grey probably would've broken a few laws . 
6070	3	a	nice dress , ryan . 
6071	3	a	 ok . 
6072	4	a	really you do . i love the material . 
6073	3	a	how come you didn't get me one ? 
6074	4	a	i actually might not go . feeling kind of tired . 
6075	4	a	oh , i don't know . i haven't decided yet . 
6076	4	a	i just feel kind of tired , you know . 
6077	1	a	maybe you've got mono . 
6078	4	a	maybe . i just . . . i don't really have anyone to go with . 
6079	1	a	yeah , totally single . hundred percent available . 
6080	3	a	hey . hey . stop that . that is offensive . indians do not eat monkey brains . and if they do . . . sign me up . . . because i am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional . 
6081	3	a	it's important that this company celebrates its diversity . and you know what , stanley ? come kwanzaa time , i have got you covered , baby . 
6082	3	a	wha ? really ? you should ! it's fun . 
6083	3	a	i love the people here . and if there was one thing i di . . . don't really care for is that they can be terribly , terribly ignorant about other cultures . and i don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend , carol . 
6084	3	a	diwali is a very important holiday for the hindus . but , frankly , i'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about indian culture . so , without further ado , kelly you are on . 
6085	3	a	kelly ? 
6086	3	a	um . . . why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday . 
6087	1	a	pam wishes . kelly , i'll take this one . diwali is a celebration of the coronation of the god-king rama . after his epic battle with ravana , the demon king of lanka . it symbolizes the battle between good and evil . . . 
6088	3	a	all right , all right , all right , all right . this isn't 'lord of the rings' . 
6089	2	a	sorry . 
6090	2	a	i started biking into work . josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than i do . and also it saves gas money , keeps me in shape . . . helps the environment . and now i know it makes me really sweaty for work . 
6091	2	a	thank you . 
6092	1	a	i see dead people . 
6093	3	a	okay . spoiler . . . alert . 
6094	1	a	he was dead the whole time . 
6095	3	a	just stop it . what's the . . . oh , whoa ! where did that come from ? 
6096	0	a	we have such a roller coaster thing , karen and i . 
6097	2	a	scuse me ? 
6098	0	a	roller-coastery friendship . hot . cold . on again . off again . sexual tension filled type of deal . it's very sam and diane . 
6099	2	a	wow . 
6100	0	a	from 'cheers' . 
6101	2	a	yup . 
6102	3	a	and another thing about the indian people . . . they love sex positions . i present to you the kama sutra . i mean look at that . who's seen that before ? 
6103	3	a	thank you , kevin . 
6104	3	a	well , i find it beautiful . 
6105	3	a	no . . . 
6106	3	a	no , you're not going to collect them . 
6107	3	a	no . this is delightful , charming culture . 
6108	3	a	my indian culture seminar was going great until toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images . it's just sex . people . . . everybody does it . i'm doing it . . . with carol ! probably tonight . 
6109	2	a	once a quarter , the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation . . . which , amazingly , is even less interesting than it sounds . 
6110	0	a	you guys ready to party ? 
6111	2	a	what's that ? 
6112	0	a	i said are you ready to party ! 
6113	3	a	 what does that look like to you ? 
6114	3	a	no one's even going to notice .

6120	3	a	all they are is chocolate , graham cracker , and marshmallow . how difficult would that have been ? 
6121	4	a	very official . 
6122	4	a	i decided to come . uh . . . i feel a little under-dressed . . . but at least i'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader , right ? is that mean ? 
6123	1	a	temp ! temp ! pflut ! pflut !

6190	3	a	what is diwali ? 
6191	3	a	you don't know what diwali is ? wow , jan . i'm surprised . it's the hindu festival of lights . i just assumed you'd be familiar with it . it's the most sacred and honored hindu holiday in the world . it's like christmas , easter , and halloween---
6192	3	a	---rolled into one . 
6193	3	a	i bet you're not even aware that our own kelly kapoor , who works in . . .

6232	1	a	sorry . i just feel like we haven't talked in awhile . 
6233	3	a	well . . . we have nothin to talk about , dwight . just do your work . . . while you still can . 
6234	1	a	when you become close with someone , you develop a kind of sixth sense . you can read their moods like a book . and right now , the title of michael's book is , 'something weird is going on . ' colon , 'what did jan say ? the michael scott story . by michael scott , with dwight schrute . '
6235	2	a	really ? wow . . . that's bad . 
6236	0	a	um , sorry . . . the scranton branch is closing ? in your face !

6255	0	a	 stamford , connecticut ! stamford , connecticut ! 
6256	2	a	i worked in scranton for a really long time . and uh , it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing . i mean , i always knew that the branch would shut down someday . i just figured it would be because michael sold the building for some magic beans . 
6257	4	a	it's a blessing in disguise . actually , not even in disguise . sometimes at home , i answer the phone , 'dunder-mifflin , this is pam . ' so , maybe that'll stop now . 
6258	3	a	darryl . noble darryl . 
6259	3	a	i know , i know . well , i'll land on my feet . don't worry about me .

6261	3	a	awesome . 
6262	3	a	this is my house . the cfo is taking away my house and giving it to josh . and josh is giving the garage to bob vance . 
6263	3	a	all right , listen up . some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing . but , i am not going to take this lying down . i have a plan and i am going to save our jobs . so just hang in there . let's go . 
6264	1	a	yes ! 
6265	4	a	oh , good . . . you're bringing dwight . 
6266	3	a	yes . this might get ugly . i need backup . 
6267	1	a	what's the plan ? 
6268	3	a	go to new york , confront the cfo , show him he's making a mistake . . . save the branch . 
6269	1	a	can i drive ? 
6270	3	a	no . . . way .

6284	2	a	what does that mean ? 
6285	2	a	say what you will about michael scott , but he would never do that . 
6286	1	a	so , do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up ? 
6287	3	a	i will improvise . i will speak from the heart . 
6288	1	a	no . bad idea . you need an attack plan . here , i'll be him , you be you . let's practice . 
6289	3	a	all right . 
6290	1	a	 dum , dum , dum , dum . . . coming home from work . 
6291	1	a	yes ? what is the meaning of this ? 
6292	3	a	can you tell us why you are shutting down scranton and putting 15 people out of work ? 
6293	1	a	well , the branch is no longer finicially viable . it's simple dollars and cents . 
6294	3	a	yes , but these are employees , sir . these are human beings . 
6295	1	a	listen , scott . . . we're losing money , okay ? it's not a charity; it's a business . and it's a dying business . 
6296	3	a	 stop . . . stop it ! just , okay . he's not going to say any of that . 
6297	1	a	 whoa hey , why not ? 
6298	3	a	because he'd be intimidated and i , just . . . let's start again . just be more scared of me , okay ?

6310	4	a	he's not here . i don't know where he is .

6319	4	a	that's , um . . . i hadn't thought about it , huh .

6330	3	a	 all right , favorite moments in dunder-mifflin history . go . 
6331	1	a	my first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher .

6346	4	a	maybe this is good . finding another job is a pain . there's another annoying boss , another desk , i'd have to learn everything all over again . so , there are reasons to stay . 
6347	2	a	hey , um , i think i am gonna take that job . and scranton . . . it's not that bad . so , if they offer you a job there , i think you should take it . 
6348	2	a	okay .

6350	3	a	oh , this was such a stupid idea ! this was so stupid . i am such a stupid idiot . i let everybody down . everybody hates me . i lost everybody's jobs . nobody likes me anymore !

6357	3	a	yeah , baby ! 
6358	1	a	in your face ! 
6359	3	a	we did it ! 
6360	1	a	oh , man . 
6361	3	a	how did we do it ? 
6362	1	a	i don't . . . have no idea . 
6363	3	a	i don't understand . 
6364	2	a	the stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff . andy bernard made these tasteful hats .

6369	0	a	playing your cards close to the vest . i get it . good luck over there , tuna . cross me and i will destroy you . 
6370	2	a	sounds good andy .

6539	3	a	you like coal mines and you wanna see 'em , well , check it out , yo , the anthracite museum ! plenty of space in the parking lot ,

6574	3	a	what is that ? a squid's eye or . . . 
6575	3	a	how did you . . . 
6576	3	a	people hate people that are different from them . that's natural . but you know what makes people forget their differences ? a great show . that is why i created the 'integration celebration' . this is the moment when scranton and stamford come together as one . united in applause .

6623	3	a	okay . well , don't bother quitting because you're fired . 
6624	3	a	you are fired ! i'm sorry , but we don't have quitters on this team ! just clean out your desk ! 
6625	3	a	don't try to apologize to me , man ! it's too late . just get out ! take your bad vibes with you . 
6626	1	a	that was my advice . remember ? i'm the one who suggested that you fire him . 
6627	3	a	probably the best advice you ever gave me , dwight . 
6628	1	a	and what advice has andy given to you today that you have acted on ? would 'none' be an accurate estimate ? none advice ? fire andy . fire . andy . 
6629	0	a	dwight may have won the battle . but i will win . . . the next battle . 
6630	3	a	whoa , angela ! hold on . hooters is a restaurant . with over 400 locations worldwide . 
6631	3	a	no . we do have to get along . can't we all just get along ? or have we forgotten the words of the reverend king . 
6632	3	a	the word merger comes from the word marriage . and that was what today was supposed to be . the loving union between people . instead , it has become like when my mom moved in with jeff . and once again , it becomes my job to fix it . 
6633	3	a	hey ! hey , everybody ! something happened ! those guys from vance refrigeration , they let the air out of our tires . 
6634	1	a	what ! 
6635	3	a	yeah ! they punk'd us ! they punk'd us good ! come on . come on ! 
6636	2	a	does he ever . 
6637	3	a	man , they got us so bad . we cannot let them get away with this . we have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators . 
6638	1	a	yeah ! 
6639	3	a	yeah . 
6640	3	a	go home , toby . just . . . 
6641	3	a	why ? i will tell you why . because they saved the worst for me . they put a hate note under my windshield wiper . check this out . it's so hateful . 'you guys suck ! you can never pull together as one and revenge us . that is why you suck ! '
6642	3	a	no . no , no , no . no . you are falling for it . you're playing right into their hands . this is just what they want you to do . don't , oh . . . 
6643	3	a	this is egregious ! this is egregious ! 
6644	3	a	see that ? mission accomplished . like a bunch of fourth graders . sometimes , what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady . although that'll change . because , by the end of the fourth grade , the lunch lady was actually the person i hung out with the most . jell-o ! 
6645	3	a	hi , jan ! 
6646	3	a	i did . major personnel crises averted . compliment accepted . 
6647	3	a	yes . 
6648	3	a	but do you realize that that was actually dwight's idea ? bad advice from my number two . 
6649	3	a	what ? 
6650	3	a	yes , i know that . for , i do read the memos . 
6651	3	a	so after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun , i have decided to make jim my new number two . 
6652	1	a	if he even wants it . it doesn't come with a pay raise . 
6653	2	a	yeah , it does , actually . 
6654	1	a	so who will be your new number three ? 
6655	3	a	uh . . . that i have not decided yet . 
6656	0	a	michael , i would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb . 
6657	3	a	thank you , andy . that's . . . very kind . thanks . 
6658	1	a	and i have to say your leadership . . . 
6659	3	a	shut it . . .

6680	2	a	yeah . good to be back . 
6681	0	a	saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot . what does it get , like four miles to the gallon ? 
6682	1	a	uh , try double that . classic transam , vintage american muscle . please . 
6683	0	a	yeah , my xterra's pretty sweet . luxurious , yet rugged . leave it to the japanese . 
6684	1	a	xterra's not even a real word . 
6685	0	a	actually , it is . it's latin for 'earth . '
6686	1	a	oh , so you drive an x-earth ?

6770	3	a	 idiot . dwight's an idiot ! did you catch that or did . . . did the cough cover it ? 
6771	1	a	sometimes it hurts michael . 
6772	3	a	 you're a jerk . dwight's a jerk ! 
6773	4	a	ohhhh ! she's absolutely adorable ! 
6774	4	a	 . . . oh , sorry . he's--he's dressed all in pink . 
6775	4	a	 . . . oh . that's . . . fun for him . 
6776	3	a	ohhh , wow . look at that . how cute . 
6777	3	a	ohh . may i ? 
6778	3	a	 hey , look at me , i'm a baby ! i'm one of those babies from 'look who's talking . ' what am i thinking ? look at all those staplers ! what's a stapler ! ? i don't even know , i'm a baby ! hey , mom , i'm thirsty ! i'm thirsty , mama ! i want some milk . and you know where milk comes from ! breasts . 
6779	2	a	hey . 
6780	2	a	just about . . . yup . now . 
6781	2	a	yes . i have started to see karen . it's very new , and . . . not really ready to talk about it openly yet , just because , i think , once the word gets out there , it might affect the way people behave around us or . . . i dunno . just , not yet . 
6782	3	a	yeah , jan , it um . . . looks like a check , piece of paper of some sort . receipt . i don't know . 
6783	3	a	i didn't hire an ex-convict . unless they mean toby . convicted rapist . . . . i'm just kidding . 
6784	3	a	hey jan , speaking of stamford , hannah brought in her baby . 
6785	4	a	 who is it ? 
6786	3	a	hannah ? 
6787	3	a	kuhhhh . . . you are such a racist . 
6788	3	a	because you think he's black . 
6789	3	a	stop it . stop it right-stop it right now . 
6790	3	a	why did the convict have to be a black guy ? it is such a stereotype . i just wish that josh had made a more progressive choice . like a white guy . . . who went to prison for . . . polluting a black guy's lake . 
6791	3	a	in our society , a black man can be arrested for almost anything . he was probably at a sporting event and . . . saw some people pushing each other , and he intervened . 
6792	4	a	why would anyone go to jail for that ? 
6793	3	a	sssssso , what we need to do . . . is to forget about this whole martin in prison thing . people will draw unfair conclusions about martin and or black people . 
6794	4	a	okay . angela ? 
6795	3	a	good . all right . 
6796	2	a	 jim halpert . 
6797	0	a	 i am so horny .

6802	2	a	she's . . . high-maintenance . 
6803	0	a	next . how about . . . . blondes are more fun . c'mon , trust me on that . 
6804	2	a	yeah , trust me , that would be fun for no one . 
6805	0	a	okay fine . um . pam , the receptionist . paaam . should i go for it ? 
6806	2	a	 . . . absolutely you should .

6810	3	a	okay , are you cool , really ? 
6811	1	a	i'm cool , i'm cool , i'm so cool . tell me what is going on . 
6812	3	a	um . . . martin , from stamford , was , at one time , in prison . no . dwight ! be cool ! be cool ! 
6813	1	a	i am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office . and i do not care if that convict is white , black , asian , german , or some kind of halfsy . i do not like criminals . 
6814	0	a	all . . . righty , let's get started . what is she into ? 
6815	2	a	i know pam pretty well . i know the things that she likes , and , just as important , i know the things that she hates . so , one of the things that she likes is pranks . and , the things that she hates . . . 
6816	2	a	frisbee-based competitions . . .

6818	2	a	she . . . 
6819	0	a	i started the main frisbee golf club at cornell . where i went to college . i live to frolf . 
6820	2	a	lead off with that . she loves hunting . she also loves those ads for six flags , with the old guy . got it . also . . . do you speak pig latin ? 
6821	3	a	hey martin , how's it going ? 
6822	4	a	my dad .

6838	3	a	ah . well . that's not true . 
6839	3	a	no you would not . 
6840	3	a	this place is not prison . it's . . . way better than prison . 
6841	0	a	pam-a-lama-ding-dong . listen , you're cute . there is no gettin' around it . so . . . i don't know if you like country music , but i was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field , crank up some tunes , smoke a few macanudos . . . maybe even toss a disk around . utway ooday ooyay inkthay , ampay ? 
6842	4	a	wow . . . i--
6843	0	a	shh . think about it . i'll hit you back . 
6844	4	a	wow . that was . . . wow . 
6845	3	a	okay ! listen up everybody ! um , you guys said that prison was better than this place , and i heard ya , loud and clear , so , i am instituting some changes to make this more like prison . we are going to start with an hour of outdoor time . so let's go ! 
6846	4	a	michael , it's freezing out . 
6847	3	a	why don't we . . . pump some iron ? anyone wanna . . . pump up ?

6852	3	a	ah . a ten inch black and white ? 
6853	3	a	these people don't realize how lucky they are . this office is the american dream . and they would rather be in the hole . 
6854	2	a	oh . andy . i thought of one last tact you can take with pam . 
6855	0	a	yeah . 
6856	2	a	quick question - do you play the guitar ? 
6857	0	a	i play the banjo . 
6858	2	a	hold on , let me think about that , yes , that'll work . but can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice ? 
6859	0	a	 you know i can , my man . 
6860	2	a	yup . that's perfect . 
6861	2	a	hey . 
6862	0	a	i'm gonna go get my banjo out of my car . 
6863	2	a	perfect . 
6864	2	a	 . . . i'm messing with andy . i'm sending him to all the women in the office with . . . just . . . terrible information on how to get them to go out with him . 
6865	2	a	 . . . oh , you know what ? . . . it was . . . gonna be pam , but . . . 
6866	2	a	uh , you know what though ? i feel like i already sicked him on pam . . . we'll give her a break . let's think of someone else . 
6867	2	a	where . . . did you learn all of this ? 
6868	3	a	internet . 
6869	2	a	so , not prison . 
6870	3	a	and prison . eh , fifty-fifty , both . look , prison stinks , is what i'm saying . it's not like you can go home , and , recharge your batteries , and come back in the morning and , be with your friends , having fun in the office . 
6871	2	a	what'd you do , prison mike ? 
6872	3	a	i stole . . . . and i robbed . and i kidnapped . . . the . . . president's son . and held him for ransom . 
6873	2	a	that is . . . quite the rap sheet , prison mike . 
6874	3	a	and i nevah got caught , neither . 
6875	2	a	well , you're . . . in . . . prison , but , mmhmm . 
6876	4	a	prison mike ? what was the food like in prison ? 
6877	3	a	gruel . sandwiches . gruel omelettes . nothing but gruel . plus , you can eat your own hair . 
6878	0	a	wow . prison sounds horrible . 
6879	3	a	yeah . yeah . well , thank you , andy . tanks . 
6880	1	a	prison mike . what's the very very worst thing about prison ? 
6881	3	a	the worst thing about prison was the . . . was the dementors . they . . . were flying all over the place , and they were scary . and they'd come down , and they'd suck the soul out of your body , and it hurt ! 
6882	4	a	wow . thank you . um , that must have been hard for you to relive that . both of you . 
6883	3	a	okay . okay , fine . you guys think prison is so great ? all right . well , here you go . 
6884	2	a	okay , michael . come on . let us out . 
6885	3	a	no ! if you think is prison is so wonderful , then , enjoy prison ! they are such babies . i am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom . and if this doesn't bother them , then i am out of ideas . 
6886	3	a	they were very disrespectful to me , and to the office . and martin has had a bad influence , to think that i gave him the benefit of the doubt . 
6887	3	a	okay . you know what toby ? i am teaching them a lesson , so . 
6888	3	a	 okay nutcases , get out of there ! good work . long day . really long . why don't you guys head home . early . time off for good behavior ! heh . good job . enjoy your freedoms ! 
6889	3	a	martin went from being a new guy from stamford . . . to a convict , to . . . my friend . back to a convict . then to . . . a kind of a nuisance , actually , to be completely honest . and finally , to . . . a quitter . and i will not miss him . and that is not because he is black . 
6890	0	a	 so we've been told , and some choose to believe it , i know they're wrong , wait and see , 'cause one day we'll find it , the ainbowray onnectionkay , the lovers , the dreamers , and meeee . . . 
6891	1	a	merry christmas ! 
6892	4	a	merry christ-- no ! why . . . why did you bring that here ? 
6893	1	a	don't worry , she's dead . oh wait . he's dead . 
6894	4	a	dwight , what uh . . . 
6895	1	a	i accidentally ran over it . it's a christmas miracle ! 
6896	4	a	well , get it out of here . 
6897	1	a	relax , ok . and because this is christmas , i am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing . do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen ? 
6898	2	a	merry christmas dwight . 
6899	1	a	jim . 
6900	2	a	wow . what have we got here ? 
6901	1	a	what does it look like ? 
6902	2	a	dead goose . 
6903	1	a	and circle gets the square . 
6904	2	a	all right . 
6905	1	a	 so can you watch this ? i'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk . 
6906	1	a	no , toby , this is different . he's already dead . 
6907	1	a	once i brought in a duck . to prepare for lunch . and people got upset . apparently , they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed . 
6908	1	a	he was already dead . and we schrutes use every part of the goose . the meat has a delicious , smoky , rich flavor . plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator , thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease . 
6909	2	a	wow . win-win . 
6910	1	a	exactly . thank you , jim . 
6911	1	a	ok , that is ridiculous . and totally against the spirit of christmas .

6920	4	a	it's behind you . 
6921	3	a	ok . . . well , i need to put this bike in there . i hope it'll fit , with all these little knickknacks . 
6922	2	a	wow . what kind of bike is that ? 
6923	3	a	umm . . . i don't know ? average kind ?

6952	3	a	and next to your kids . what ? 
6953	3	a	i don't understand ? 
6954	2	a	it's a bold move , to photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father . but then again , michael's a bold guy . is bold the right word ? 
6955	3	a	ok
6956	3	a	no , no no no ok , ok , you know what , you're not thinking straight . you know what you need ? you need to think this through in jamaica's largest fresh water pool .

6982	3	a	fine ! have your party . just no guests .

6988	3	a	 thanks . how did you push away the bad thoughts ? 
6989	4	a	like what ? 
6990	3	a	like maybe , the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed , that were , foreign , and scary ? 
6991	4	a	well . . um i , i don't . . . 
6992	3	a	and not that you didn't want to try them . some wine may have helped . do you know what i'm referring to ?

7010	4	a	i feel like i've been kinda cold to karen and there's no real reason for it . i mean it's not like she's ever done anything to me . so , i think i probably shouldn't be cold to her .

7349	4	a	michael sends me a postcard from every vacation he goes on . atlantic city , he wishes i was here . busch gardens , virginia , all i got was this lousy postcard . and this time , i'm jamaican-him-crazy . i don't know how far away he thought he was , because he put $10 worth of stamps on this . 
7350	1	a	hello , you're back . 
7351	3	a	yeah , mon . me just got back to the office . 
7352	1	a	while you were gone . . .

7374	3	a	i would love to take them all to jamaica , but is that good management ? yes . but is it the best management ? well , i can't afford it , and corporate won't pay for it . so who's the real criminal ? 
7375	3	a	how many of you know the meaning of the jamaican term , hakuna matata ? 
7376	2	a	 are you stoned ? 
7377	3	a	i . . . 
7378	2	a	in the picture , are you high ? 
7379	3	a	oh , that's red eye . 
7380	2	a	is that not what happens when you're high ? 
7381	3	a	well . . . 
7382	3	a	hey , can we just focus ? 
7383	4	a	michael and jan together in jamaica . i guess i would just need a little bit more evidence than seeing it with my own eyes . 
7384	1	a	come on . come on . 
7385	3	a	okay . well , jan's email password is not dunder mifflin , sandals , jamaica , michael , michael scott , jan scott , or mrs . jan scott .

7387	3	a	her passwords aren't going to be dwight , dwight . that's stupid . okay .

7389	4	a	okay . so i went on the internet , and she is not gonna find another apartment for that price . i mean this one is twice as much , and it doesn't have parking . does she like to park ? 
7390	2	a	oh , loves it . 
7391	4	a	okay . this one is the same price but it's got . . . 
7392	2	a	green walls . 
7393	4	a	i think that's mold . 
7394	2	a	ooh . . . fancy . 
7395	1	a	spiderman , peter parker , would not reveal his love for mary jane for fear that she might be captured and harmed by the green goblin . now , if michael had studied the spidey principles that i'd drawn up for him , jan's boobs might not be all over the internet . 
7396	4	a	yes , it is the island luau inventory '07 . it's actually a success compared to disco audit '05 . 
7397	3	a	 hey ! hey ! stop your mouth , please . 
7398	0	a	hey dwight , i bet i can stack faster than you can .

7449	2	a	dwight and i used to go on sales calls all the time . in fact , i have a picture to remember that time . oh young jim . there is just so much i need to warn you about . and yet , tragically , i cannot . 
7450	0	a	sebring by chrysler . heck of a . . . motor . . . carriage .

7460	1	a	come on ! ! 
7461	3	a	whoah , whoah . oh hahahaha . vamanos ! 
7462	0	a	bueno . 
7463	2	a	seriously ? you're going to sit in the back ? 
7464	1	a	uh , yeah . it's the safest part of the car . in the event of a crash , the driver always protects his side of the car first . 
7465	3	a	here we go . 
7466	0	a	in order to take down dwight , i have to chip away at his ally , which , in this case , is michael . here's the good news . every success i've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down . 
7467	0	a	what's the deal with dwight doing your laundry ? 
7468	3	a	ugh . . . that is a long story . um , couple of months ago , dwight tried to go behind my back with jan and get my job and i am now having him do my laundry as punishment . 
7469	0	a	wow , that is a long story , but quite well told , michael . i find it very interesting . especially about the part dwight going behind your back and basically , like , being a terrible person . you know if you want your laundry done right ? i used to work at abercrombie . so , pretty good folder . 
7470	4	a	really ? 
7471	4	a	ok . sure . 
7472	1	a	leave the keys . 
7473	2	a	you still do that thing ? 
7474	1	a	leave the keys ! 
7475	3	a	hawkman . 
7476	0	a	my plan is taking longer than i thought but i don't give up easily . i have walked two marathons . 
7477	3	a	 let's go . the men's room was disgusting . 
7478	2	a	after you sir . 
7479	1	a	no thank you , i never let anyone walk behind me . seven out of ten attacks are from the rear . 
7480	2	a	ok , well , that still leaves a 30% chance that i will attack you from the front . 
7481	1	a	uh , yeah , but it will be easier to stop . i can always block the blow . i can counter it with . . . 
7482	4	a	angela , you seem so happy . i bet you wish you were like this all the time . 
7483	4	a	that's great . 
7484	3	a	hey , did you catch that up at lake wallenpaupack ? 
7485	3	a	you know , i used to go up there all the time with my step-dad , and i never caught anything that big . 
7486	0	a	caught an eighty-pound shark off of montauk . it's in the hamptons . my dad's got a 42-ft bayliner . sniped it with a rifle from the crow's nest . also shot a deer once . 
7487	3	a	you know what ? let's get right down to it . dunder-mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse , but what we lack in flash , we will make up for with hardwork and decency . 
7488	0	a	ok , this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin . we trade on the new york stock exchange . ever heard of it ? it's in new york . 
7489	3	a	i think what andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company , we will give you the care and attention of a small company . 
7490	0	a	oh , man , that is , like , poetry . 
7491	3	a	no . 
7492	0	a	i swear , this guy could sell paper to a tree . 
7493	3	a	stop it . stop it . 
7494	0	a	ow . 
7495	0	a	oh man . talk about your classic 'lame dash o . ' do we even want that guy buying our paper ? 
7496	3	a	yes . 
7497	0	a	i . . . i'm so sorry man . i really screwed that up . 
7498	3	a	ah , no . don't worry about it . 
7499	0	a	i really 'schruted' it . 
7500	3	a	what ? 
7501	0	a	schruted' it . it's just this thing that people say around your office all the time . like , when you screw something up in a really irreversible way , you 'schruted' it . i don't know where it comes from though . do you think it comes from dwight schrute ? 
7502	3	a	i don't know . who knows how words are formed . 
7503	2	a	we can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser . 
7504	1	a	can i use your phone ? 
7505	1	a	thanks . 
7506	2	a	let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer . namely , we know the tax season is coming up , so by april 1st we can have you fully stocked . 
7507	1	a	 one . . . 
7508	2	a	we have discount prices on ink cartridges . . . 
7509	1	a	three . . . 
7510	2	a	and , also , any forms that you are going to need . . . 
7511	1	a	seven . . . 
7512	2	a	we can custom make them . 
7513	1	a	sure . 
7514	2	a	sure , that's true we can't compete with their prices . but let me ask you something . how important to you is customer service ? 
7515	1	a	erm , that's one of the 'big guys . ' been on hold this whole time . 
7516	2	a	 and this is dunder-mifflin . 
7517	2	a	hey , kelly , it's jim . 
7518	1	a	here is my card . it's got my cell number , my pager number , my home number , and my other pager number . i never take vacations , i never get sick , and i don't celebrate any major holidays .

7520	0	a	hey boss . got a minute ? 
7521	3	a	yes , andy . 
7522	0	a	i forget , why did dwight say he was late this morning ? 
7523	3	a	he didn't say . 
7524	3	a	no , you are remembering it wrong . 
7525	3	a	dwight betrayed me once before . so this is his strike two . you know what they say ? fool me once , strike one . but fool me twice , strike three . 
7526	1	a	i like karen . she's pretty and appears intelligent . 
7527	2	a	well , i like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence . 
7528	1	a	my girlfriend is also beautiful and smart . she could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys . 
7529	2	a	we should go on a double date . 
7530	1	a	no thank you . 
7531	3	a	i knew it . 
7532	0	a	oh , doggie . 
7533	2	a	sure . look at you !

7538	1	a	i am not a liar . 
7539	3	a	you are lying right now . 
7540	0	a	it sure seems like he is lying . 
7541	1	a	stay out of this , you ! 
7542	3	a	i know that you went to corporate this morning , and i know that you lied about it . and given our history , i need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing . 
7543	1	a	michael , i cannot tell you what i was doing there . but you have to trust me , i would never do anything to hurt you or this company . 
7544	3	a	ok , you know what ? i want you to think about your future in this company . i want you to think about it long and hard . 
7545	1	a	that's what she said . 
7546	3	a	don't . don't you dare . i want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day . 
7547	1	a	it's going to be ok . 
7548	1	a	that's not the worst thing in the world . i'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love . it won't be that bad . look at kelly and ryan . 
7549	1	a	well , i don't have a lot of choices .

7858	3	a	so you know who turned out to be kind of a creep ? ben franklin . and elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice . which rhymed . really makes you wonder how ben franklin can become president , but someone like elizabeth can't . 
7859	1	a	are you near sighted or far sighted ? 
7860	1	a	gah ! ! ! 
7861	2	a	damn , lost another file . going to have to reboot . again . hey , dwight , do you want an altoid ? 
7862	1	a	what do you think ? 
7863	2	a	in school , we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang . for the last couple of weeks i've been conducting a similar experiment . 
7864	2	a	 dwight , want an altoid ? 
7865	1	a	okay . 
7866	2	a	 altoid ? 
7867	1	a	sure
7868	2	a	 mint dwight ? 
7869	1	a	inbwit ? yes . 
7870	1	a	 
7871	2	a	what are you doing ? 
7872	1	a	i . . . 
7873	2	a	what ? 
7874	1	a	i don't know . my mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden . 
7875	3	a	always the bridesmaids , right ladies ? 
7876	4	a	phyllis . . . ended up using the exact same invitations as roy and me . so it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding . and i was like 'wait , thought i called that off' . 
7877	2	a	so what's in the box ? 
7878	1	a	hello , angela . 
7879	1	a	you look as beautiful as the queen of england . 
7880	1	a	the shrutes have their own traditions . we usually marry standing in our own graves . makes the funerals very romantic , but the weddings are a bleak affair . 
7881	2	a	those flowers are nice . 
7882	2	a	phyllis and robert . 
7883	4	a	also , pam and roy . 
7884	3	a	there she is . i swear phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at dunder mifflin . 
7885	3	a	how you doin' ? you excited . 
7886	3	a	me , too . if you need to vomit , that is ok . i did . do you want to talk about tonight ? 
7887	3	a	you're probably worried about pleasing bob . a lot of pressure . phyllis , did you break wind ? it's okay , if you did . it's a very natural reaction . it's your wedding . and you're nervous . . . 
7888	3	a	okay . . . umm . . . i'm sure that bob . . . wow . that is . . . that is pungent . i lost my train of thought . aaah . . . are you set on that hairstyle ? 
7889	3	a	here , let me . . . 
7890	3	a	just cover up that bald patch . 
7891	3	a	okay . 
7892	3	a	you might be surprised to learn that i've only been to one other wedding . it's actually a very cute story . my mom was marrying jeff . and they asked me to be ring bearer . i was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet . 
7893	3	a	 i hate you ! 
7894	3	a	long story short: jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer . and the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said 'boo' . 
7895	1	a	why are all these people here ? there are too many people on this earth . we need a new plague . who are all these people ? 
7896	2	a	you know what ? i bet a lot of them are wedding crashers . 
7897	1	a	no way . 
7898	2	a	did you ever see that movie ? 
7899	1	a	of course i saw it . 
7900	1	a	i saw wedding crashers accidentally . i bought a ticket for grizzly man and went into the wrong theatre . after an hour , i figured i was in the wrong theatre , but i kept waiting . that's the thing about bear attacks , they come when you least expect it . 
7901	2	a	you know i just wish , i wish , i had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out . 
7902	1	a	once again , jim , i will take care of this . i will locate the wedding crashers and report them to phyllis . that way i won't have to get her a gift . 
7903	3	a	this strappy young lad sitting here is phyllis' father , albert , and he is quite the ladies' man , aren't you albert , hah ? ah , ringbearer . i could have done better . i will do better . i am going to be better . i can't believe i'm actually doing this ! ooh ! are you ready for this , albert ? i am . let's do it . 
7904	4	a	that's my dress . 
7905	3	a	 that's ok . 
7906	1	a	it's a miracle . 
7907	3	a	this is bull**** ! 
7908	3	a	me walking phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding . and now . . . the wedding has no highlight . 
7909	3	a	i can't believe i pushed that . . . that guy's lazy ass around all day . . . until he was ready to stand up and steal the show . that's . . . well . . . i got news for you , albert . if that's your real name . the show's not over . 
7910	3	a	ladies and gentlemen , may i present to you for the first time as a couple , mr . and mrs . bob vance ! 
7911	3	a	oh , shiii . . . 
7912	3	a	ladies and gentleman , for the first time as a couple , mr . and mrs . bob vance . yeah ! that's what i'm talking about ! 
7913	3	a	congratulations , bob . you're a good man . but just know . . . if you ever lay a finger on phyllis , i will kill you . 
7914	3	a	agreed . no fingers will be laid on phyllis . oh , decided to sit down again , huh ? great . bet you can hear me , too . 
7915	1	a	best of luck , phyllis . also i'm going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers . 
7916	1	a	dammit , phyllis ! 
7917	4	a	what do you mean ? 
7918	4	a	oh . . . um . . . no . that's . . . um . . . that's actually fine
7919	4	a	okay , that's a lot of good ideas . thanks
7920	1	a	scuse me , sir . how do you know the happy couple ? 
7921	1	a	the bride and groom ? what are their names ? 
7922	1	a	oh i get it , i get it , come on , freeloader . let's move it . come on . come on . 
7923	1	a	got to find yourself another wedding to crash , my friend . 
7924	3	a	phyllis ! are you happy with everything ? what can i do to make it more perfecter ? 
7925	3	a	i'm already on it . the chicken ? totally undercooked . i sent it back . 
7926	3	a	i will take care of that . 
7927	3	a	i do . i know a fair amount about fine food . . . and drink . this is a white . 
7928	4	a	hey . 
7929	4	a	you're kidding me , right ? 
7930	4	a	roy , i picked those flowers . phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding . 
7931	4	a	yeah . 
7932	4	a	it's okay . 
7933	3	a	the most important part of a speech is the opening line . when time is not a factor , i like to try out three or four different ones . 
7934	3	a	phyllis and bob: their celebrity couple name would be phlob . you look at her . . . and she's kind of matronly today , but back in high school , i swear , her nickname was 'easy rider' . now as for bob . . . bob vance . . . 
7935	3	a	is a guy that . . . 
7936	3	a	he works . . . okay hold , hold on , hold on . look . look . i didn't say anything when phyllis' dad upstaged me at the ceremony . and i think you owe me this . kay . 
7937	3	a	no . i'm not going to . . . 
7938	3	a	ok . all right . 
7939	3	a	oh . yeah . you're out of here ! you're . . . yeah . i hate you ! 
7940	2	a	hey .

7943	4	a	oh . . . i'm pacing myself . 
7944	2	a	come on . get out there . give the people what they want . 
7945	4	a	no . i'm such a dorky dancer . 
7946	2	a	i know . it's very cute . 
7947	2	a	hypothetically , if i thought pam was interested , then . . . no , it's totally hypothetical . 
7948	3	a	come . . . come on ! 
7949	1	a	i can't let you in , michael . 
7950	3	a	dwight , just . . . 
7951	1	a	no , it's bob and phyllis' orders . 
7952	3	a	look , i just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake . i'm not even going to dance one song . 
7953	1	a	you are a real life wedding crasher and i must bounce you . i'm sorry , it gives me no pleasure . 
7954	3	a	ok . 
7955	4	a	yeah , that's weird . i thought they only played the police . 
7956	3	a	 ee . . . i was meant for you . . . buppity du bom bu . 
7957	2	a	here's a 'not hypothetical' . i'm really happy i'm with karen . 
7958	3	a	i just want phyllis to have a great day . 
7959	3	a	we are great together . we are a great team . 
7960	3	a	yes . yes . they were . robert parrish ! i should talk to her . i don't want this to ruin her honeymoon . 
7961	3	a	dude , keep it together . i listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head . 
7962	3	a	phyllis . phyllis ! wait ! please . i'm sorry . i just . . . i just wanted to make this a day to remember . 
7963	3	a	yeah . yeah . he's kind of a weirdo . 
7964	3	a	you're . . . you're welcome . 
7965	3	a	they say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake . i say that's crazy . i say let them eat cake . margaret thatcher said that about marriage . smart broad . 
7966	3	a	be careful . oh no ! ! oh wow ! phyllis ! phyllis ! you look like a clown ! here . get me ! get me ! 
7967	3	a	oh hey , kevin , nice of you to join us , where were you ?

7974	1	a	don't be an idiot . ' changed my life . 
7975	1	a	whenever i'm about to do something , i think , 'would an idiot do that ? ' and if they would , i do not do that thing . 
7976	3	a	will they throw their hats , you think ? 
7977	3	a	a lot of times , at a . . . school , or naval academy , after a rousing speech , the crowd would throw its hats high into the air . 
7978	3	a	yeah , i know , i know . i'm just saying if they did throw their hats i've got a great line for that: 'may your hats fly as high as your dreams . ' . . . that was a pretty good line . 
7979	3	a	i understand ! wow . relax , spazzy boy . sometimes you're such a little spaz ! whoa , hey ! 
7980	3	a	we have fun . 
7981	4	a	okay , just so you know , it's just the students from my class in a little studio . 
7982	4	a	thanks . 
7983	4	a	i'm really happy to be back with roy . i think it shows maturity . maturity and dignity . . . . is that braggy ? i don't mean it to be braggy .

7986	4	a	oh , yeah ! we have such a solid foundation , you know . 
7987	4	a	yeah . oh , you should come to my art show , by the way . 
7988	4	a	i mean , it's not a big deal , but i think a lot of people from the office will be there . 
7989	3	a	campus . brings back so many memories . . . . that i would have made . hey . frisbee . check that out . aww ! what do you say we get our fris on before class ? whoo ! 
7990	1	a	 . . . oh my god . animal stool . 
7991	4	a	dwight , what are you doing ? 
7992	1	a	solving a mystery , if that's quite alright with you . come to papa . okay , ladies and gentlemen , what we have here is a bird that has been trapped in a vent . fortunately i have found it befo--bat ! baaat ! bat ! 
7993	1	a	baaaat ! bat ! no ! everyone remain calm ! there it goes ! 
7994	3	a	okay , this is it . ryan is doing my intro right now . 
7995	3	a	i can't hear what he's saying , but he looks like he's really into it . 
7996	1	a	we have . . . a bat . . . in the office . 
7997	2	a	okay . thanks . animal control will be here at six . 
7998	1	a	at six ? ! no , that is unacceptable . okay , jim , you are the number two in this office . you need to step up and show some leadership . 
7999	2	a	i'm sorry what did you say ? so wierd . . . 
8000	1	a	what ? what's so wierd ? 
8001	2	a	the bat , i mean , i know i felt it bite me , but look . there's no mark . i feel so . . . tingly . . . so strangely powerful . . . oh well . 
8002	1	a	 this is your job , halpert . 
8003	2	a	ow ! 
8004	2	a	that bread on your desk ? i just picked it up . it's white hot . 
8005	2	a	what ? . . . no . it burned me . i . . . bizarre . 
8006	1	a	no . . . no . one crisis at a time . 
8007	1	a	if a vampire bat was in the u . s . , it would make sense for it to come to a 'sylvania . ' like penn-sylvania . now that doesn't mean that jim is going to become a vampire . only that he carries the vampiric germ . 
8008	4	a	oh ! no , you should go . 
8009	3	a	okay , i'm seeing some confused . . . faces out there . let me slow down a little bit . break this down . okay . the more stickers you sell , the more profit , fancy word for money , you have to buy playstations and beanie babies . 
8010	3	a	 . . . and products ! 
8011	3	a	well . . . okay , i was just kind of getting it going . um , alright . well , okay , we can do questions . okay . very good . first hand up . 
8012	3	a	we can't overestimate the value of computers . yes , they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails . but real business is done on paper , okay ? write that down . 
8013	2	a	oh , thank god . i have such a headache from that glare . 
8014	2	a	the glare off angela's crucifix ? it's blinding . 
8015	1	a	i don't have a lot of experience with vampires , but i have hunted werewolves . i shot one once . but by the time i got to it , it had turned back into my neighbor's dog . 
8016	1	a	extraordinary events call for extraordinary actions . we form an allegiance--
8017	1	a	--to use sudden violence . 
8018	1	a	do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake ? 
8019	3	a	 . . . i say you will miss our service , and i absolutely guarantee you'll come back . 
8020	3	a	 . . . we don't want them back , 'cause they're . . . stupid . 
8021	3	a	nice try , how's your pollack-says-what index ? 
8022	3	a	thanks , kowalsky . um , can we get on track here ? 
8023	3	a	 . . . wait , ryan said that ? 
8024	1	a	flush him towards the door . on my go . . . now ! 
8025	3	a	yeah sure , you know business , sitting up here in your ivory tower . and your ebony tower . you know what ? tell you one thing , dunder-mifflin is here to stay . 
8026	3	a	david will always beat goliath . 
8027	3	a	yeah , yeah . you know what else is facing five goliaths ? america . al-qaeda , global warming , sex predators . . . mercury poisoning . so do we just give up ? is that what we're learning in business school ? 
8028	3	a	dunder-mifflin is the big picture ! can't you understand that ? no , you can't . you're too young . ryan . . . has never made a sale . and he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita . and everybody thinks he's a tease . well you know what ? he doesn't know anything , and neither do you . so suck on that ! 
8029	3	a	business is always personal . it's the most personal thing in the world . when we get back to the office , pack your things . 
8030	3	a	you heard me , pack your things . 
8031	2	a	so . . . you're cool to just wait here for animal control ? 
8032	1	a	animal control ? i've been controlling animals since i was six . 
8033	2	a	cool . okay . i'm gonna go home and lie down , draw the shades . . . there's just so much sun in here . . . bye dwight . 
8034	1	a	goodbye jim . and good luck . 
8035	1	a	jim is on a path now . an eternal journey , and i wish him well . but i have a destiny in this realm . specifically , in the kitchen . 
8036	4	a	 . . . and it's all from the same series . 
8037	4	a	called 'impressions . '
8038	4	a	not that i call myself an impressionist , per se . 
8039	4	a	i hope so . 
8040	4	a	i still need . . . you know , my breakthrough , or whatever . hey , babe , how are you ? 
8041	4	a	hey , kenny .

8047	4	a	thank you . 
8048	3	a	fire you ? no , no no . you are moving . . . to the annex . 
8049	3	a	a good manager doesn't fire people . he hires people and inspires people . . . . people , ryan . and people will never go out of business . 
8050	3	a	pam-casso ! sorry i'm late , i had to race across town . 
8051	4	a	oh , michael . 
8052	3	a	wow ! you did these . . . freehand ?

8066	3	a	okay . 
8067	3	a	it is . . . a message . it is an inspiration , it is . . . a source of beauty . and without paper , it could not have happened . unless , you had a camera . 
8068	3	a	well ultimately i went into business to inspire people . they say those who can't do , teach . i can do both . i teach doing . 
8069	2	a	ok , here we go . . . digest of business terms , cliffsnotes on business economics , and a sales encyclopedia . 
8070	3	a	wow ! that's a lot of books , do you have , umm , one book that sums up all of these . 
8071	2	a	those are the books that sum up the other books .

8074	3	a	oh , umm , ever since i started here , i've kept a diary of all my sales .

8088	3	a	i have a lot of big ideas , and the trick is to get it out of my brain and into theirs , in a way that is easy to swallow . simple . . . kids love candy bars . 
8089	3	a	oh , oh , i take umbrage to that premise . . . ses . umm , let me ask you this: how many people exist in the world ? over forty billion . what are they going to be writing on . . . rocks ? any one else ? yep .

8103	1	a	yes . but this seems to be . . . 
8104	3	a	and now , the chains . 
8105	3	a	a lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids . and that's why so many other people in my class were kids . self fulfilling prophecy . it's um , it's really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school . 
8106	3	a	magic magic magic magic magic magic . . . and now , michael the magic , will attempt to escape from extreme bondage . can he do it ? i don't see how he can .

8220	3	a	ok . excuse me . what's going on ? what is it ?

8223	3	a	what has gotten into you ? 
8224	3	a	no , no , no . 
8225	3	a	come on , let's go back to the party . 
8226	3	a	don't take that dress . stop it , jan . 
8227	3	a	no , no , no , means please don't . please . 
8228	3	a	i'm not going to slam you up against the wall . 
8229	3	a	you're acting inappropriate . jan . 
8230	4	a	hey , where have you been all night ? i was looking forward to hanging out with you . 
8231	4	a	hey , don't you have a daughter ? 
8232	1	a	oh good , you're up . hey , who makes this chair ? 
8233	1	a	i want one . it's got good solid construction . comfortable . what is this ? oak ? 
8234	1	a	what do you know ? 
8235	2	a	you stay here and have fun , because i'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with david wallace . 
8236	2	a	wallace ? what the hell , have you dated like every guy here ? wow . ok . you got me . 
8237	2	a	so , none of them ? 
8238	2	a	really ? 
8239	2	a	ok . 
8240	3	a	rachel thinks that i brought homemade potato salad and i just picked it up at the supermarket . it's funny . i wish i could make potato salad that good . it's just potatoes and mayonnaise . there is something wrong with jan . 
8241	2	a	i don't know . where to begin ? my ball . 
8242	1	a	the chimney is in decent shape . not great . i found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all , it was a pretty fun cocktail party . 
8243	4	a	i want us to make it . i want a fresh start . 
8244	4	a	oh ok , but in order for us to make it , there can't be any secrets between us . 
8245	4	a	just listen . remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married ? i kissed jim . 
8246	4	a	he told me how he felt and i guess i had feelings too , and we kissed . 
8247	4	a	just listen . 
8248	4	a	don't yell ! 
8249	4	a	this is over . 
8250	3	a	our first fight . if this is about what happened in the bathroom , there was no place to cuddle . . . 
8251	3	a	you didn't have any of the potato salad did you ? 
8252	3	a	well , if that's the way you feel , my lady , then you have hurt me greatly . 
8253	3	a	i'm not going to cry . i feel like it but i am not going to . why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces . 
8254	3	a	i want the house , jan . i want the picket fence . i want the ketchup fights and the tickling , and the giggling . 
8255	3	a	whatever . 
8256	3	a	that's all , you didn't mean it ? 
8257	3	a	i love you , jan . 
8258	1	a	don't break up you guys , you're great together . 
8259	2	a	ok , so promise that you'll wait till we leave the parking lot before you go to the bar . 
8260	4	a	yes boss . 
8261	1	a	why would the architect design stairs this wide ? was there an obese family in here before you ? 
8262	1	a	how convenient . 
8263	1	a	space shuttle . which one ? oh , atlantis . good thing it's not the discovery . you play soccer ? 
8264	2	a	i don't know . feel like . . . friday night crowds . . . 
8265	2	a	agoraphobic ? 
8266	2	a	really ? 
8267	2	a	absolutely correct . 
8268	2	a	kev , have a good weekend . 
8269	2	a	here we go . . . 
8270	2	a	ok . . . 
8271	2	a	sounds good . 
8272	2	a	hey . . . 
8273	4	a	roy ! 
8274	4	a	roy don't ! 
8275	1	a	pam , please call security ! 
8276	1	a	everyday , for eight years , i have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees . and everyday , for eight years , people have laughed at me . well , who's laughing now ? 
8277	3	a	no need for consternation , everything is under control . 
8278	3	a	it was a crime of passion , jan , not a disgruntled employee . everyone here is extremely gruntled . 
8279	3	a	no . . . 
8280	3	a	no , he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this roy thing as leverage . 
8281	3	a	yeppers . 
8282	3	a	i don't . . . remember . 
8283	3	a	yeesh . . . 
8284	4	a	i really don't want to talk about it . i don't mean to be rude , but i just . . . i don't want to comment on what happened . it
8285	2	a	i guess . . . all things considered , i was lucky dwight was there . and roy was lucky that dwight only used pepper spray . and not the nunchucks or the throwing stars . 
8286	2	a	hey man , i never got a chance to thank you . . . for stopping roy . thank you . 
8287	1	a	thank you not necessary and thus , not accepted . i saw someone breaking the law and i interceded . 
8288	2	a	okay . um . . . got you something . 
8289	1	a	don't want it . 
8290	2	a	you don't know what it is . 
8291	1	a	don't want it . won't open it . don't need it . won't take it . citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens . 
8292	2	a	it was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead . that would have made us even , i think . he saves my life , i get him a box for his desk toy . even steven . 
8293	1	a	no , don't call me a hero . do you know who the real heroes are ? the guys who wake up every morning , and go into their normal jobs , and get a distress call from the commissioner , and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime . those are the real heroes . 
8294	3	a	ok i want you to be darryl and ask me for a raise , because i want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you . 
8295	2	a	where'd you get that ? 
8296	3	a	wikipedia . 
8297	3	a	wikipedia . . . is the best thing ever . anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject , so you know you are getting the best possible information . 
8298	3	a	ok , darryl , ask me for a raise . 
8299	2	a	hey , mike . since roy left i've been doing a lot more work , and i need a raise . 
8300	3	a	hmm , well that's interesting darryl . i think . . . that maybe you should . . . 
8301	2	a	i can't hear you . 
8302	3	a	what i'm saying is that , 
8303	2	a	still nothin' . 
8304	3	a	ok , see what i did ? 
8305	2	a	no . 
8306	3	a	by leaning back , and by whispering , i established a dominant physical position . 
8307	2	a	nice . 
8308	3	a	ok , let's try another one . um . . . 
8309	2	a	okay . 
8310	3	a	walking out of the room unexpectedly . 
8311	2	a	and what happens in this one ? 
8312	3	a	it's a surprise . 
8313	2	a	okay . 
8314	3	a	go ahead , ask me for a raise . 
8315	2	a	can i have a raise ? 
8316	2	a	 sex , steve martin , terri hatcher . 
8317	3	a	what ? 
8318	2	a	what ? 
8319	3	a	no , what did you say ? 
8320	2	a	i didn't say anything . i was waiting to see what happened . 
8321	3	a	oh it . . . sounded interesting . . . what you were gonna . . . 
8322	1	a	i saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed . his head was thrown back , his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position . perp grabbed the victim . i removed my weapon from its secure hiding place . 
8323	1	a	irrelevant . discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes , nose , and face area . rendering him utterly and completely disabled . then i contacted the authorities . the end . 
8324	3	a	 yeah . 
8325	3	a	yes , yeah , absolutely . have a seat . 
8326	3	a	you know what ? actually , let's go into the conference room . 
8327	3	a	no , you know what ? let's stay here . no let's go . . . yeah let's go to the conference room . 
8328	3	a	tactic number six . change the location of the meeting at the last second . totally throws 'em off . 
8329	3	a	number 14 , declining to speak first . makes them feel uncomfortable , puts you in control . 
8330	3	a	 i am declining to speak first . 
8331	3	a	hmm . ohh , darryl . you are a good worker , and a good man . i just , you know , times are tight . and i just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now . 
8332	3	a	what ? 
8333	3	a	no , this is a power suit . 
8334	3	a	 i do not buy woman's clothes . i would not make that mistake again . 
8335	3	a	ohh . . . kay . 
8336	3	a	all right . 
8337	3	a	alright , you know what ? pam , could you please tell darryl that this is not a woman's suit ? 
8338	4	a	oh my god , that's a woman's suit ! 
8339	3	a	no , i do , i , i wear men's suits , ok ? i got this out of a bin . 
8340	3	a	there were these huge bins of clothes , and everybody was rifling through them like crazy , and i grabbed one . and it fit ! so i don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit . at the very least it's bisexual . 
8341	3	a	uh , missterious . and it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side . . . that's the mystery . 
8342	3	a	okay . 
8343	3	a	would you stop it , please ? 
8344	2	a	so , none of that tipped you off ? 
8345	3	a	it's european , ok ? it's a european cut . 
8346	4	a	michael , the pants don't have any pockets . 
8347	3	a	no , they don't . see ? 
8348	3	a	italians don't wear pockets . 
8349	4	a	it's been a really rough couple of days . . . this helps a little . 
8350	3	a	no , i don't want to do that because i'm twice your size anyway . 
8351	3	a	um , let's just do this in 15 minutes . 
8352	3	a	negotiations are all about controlling things . about being in the driver's seat . and make one tiny mistake , you're dead . i made one tiny mistake . i wore woman's clothes . 
8353	3	a	let's get down to business . why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise . 
8354	3	a	 that was a very good point . 
8355	3	a	 you make a very compelling argument . 
8356	4	a	sorry i almost got you killed . 
8357	2	a	yeah , that was nuts . 
8358	4	a	he could have broken your nose or something . crazy . it's just so stupid . i mean , getting back with roy and everything . i mean , what was i thinking , right ? 
8359	2	a	no , i mean , you guys really seem to have a strong connection . 
8360	4	a	not anymore . it's , um . . . it's completely over now . 
8361	2	a	we'll see . i'm sure you guys will . . . find you way back to one another someday . 
8362	4	a	jim . . . i am really . . . sorry . 
8363	2	a	oh , yeah . don't worry about it . 
8364	3	a	i am going to give you a piece of paper . i want you to write down how much you want , and i want you to slide it back across the desk to me . 
8365	3	a	because , that is the way these things are done . in . . . films . no , slide--- slide it , yes . 
8366	3	a	oh . come on . be serious . 
8367	3	a	i . . . i can't give you that , i--- i don't make this much . 
8368	3	a	i don't . want me to prove it to you ? there is . . . a pay stub . 
8369	3	a	plus perks , yes . 
8370	3	a	fourteen years . 
8371	3	a	no , please , please . . . 
8372	3	a	ok , let's take 15 , again . 
8373	3	a	a boss's salary isn't just about money , it is about perks . it . . . for example , every year i get a $100 gas card . . . can't put a price tag on that . 
8374	2	a	ok , if you don't want a gift , at least let me buy you a beer , or lunch or something . 
8375	1	a	when han solo returns to the death star in the millennium falcon , and shoots down the tie fighters and saves the rebel cause , do you think he does so for a free beer ? 
8376	2	a	boy i---
8377	1	a	no . and why are you so interested in buying me something jim , what's your angle ? 
8378	2	a	it's like when he annoys me and i want to screw with him to get him back , he never sees it coming . but now , i want to be nice to him , and actually give him something , and he's like an eel . i just can't grab onto him . it's infuriating . 
8379	2	a	well . . . yes , that's probably what it is . so what do i do ? 
8380	3	a	oh , thank you . 
8381	3	a	i didn't give you $40 . 
8382	3	a	okay . okay , here's the straight . . . dope . no tricks . no wikipedia . 
8383	3	a	i talked to corporate , and they told me that i can only give you a 5% raise . 
8384	3	a	well what am i supposed to do ? 
8385	3	a	i'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now . that is ridiculous . 
8386	3	a	 that's true . 
8387	3	a	you know what ? i should . 
8388	3	a	i have been a loyal employee for a long time . 
8389	3	a	you know what ? i deserve a bump .

8459	1	a	jim , could you please inform andy bernard that he is being shunned . 
8460	2	a	andy , dwight says welcome back , and he could use a hug . 
8461	1	a	ok , tell him that's not true .

8469	3	a	i can , and i have . 
8470	3	a	guys , i'm not the only one who's driven the forklift . pudge has driven the forklift .

8482	2	a	i don't know , we'll figure somethin' out . 
8483	3	a	yes , yes . but it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world . . . if somebody . . . 
8484	3	a	it's a big red trash compactor ! 
8485	3	a	okay , okay ! i got it . i got it . . . . only on the rarest of occasions . . . 
8486	3	a	 . . . would i go near---
8487	3	a	toby now has the floor . . . and he is going to try not to screw this up , like everything else in his life . let me rephrase that . i believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as darryl . here we go ! 
8488	3	a	yes , good . fine . like stretching and . . . 
8489	3	a	wow , that is . . . that time really adds up . that's like . . . a half an hour , every hour ? 
8490	3	a	ok , you know what ? you're making it sound kind of lame . so , skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff . like sometimes computers can explode , can they not ? 
8491	3	a	ok , you know what ? i think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom . sorry , he is very lame . um , let's see . 'seasonal affective disorder ! a depression that includes weight gain , fatigue , irritability , brought on by the low light of winter . '
8492	3	a	ok guys , you know what ? i didn't--- i didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation .

8494	3	a	yes . 'which can contribute to heart disease . ' heart disease kills more people that balers . 
8495	3	a	mmmm , no , no , it's . . . sedentary . . . 
8496	3	a	no . 
8497	3	a	darryl , i did not walk out in the middle of yours . so , i---
8498	3	a	okay . . . . what , nerf isn't cool anymore ? 
8499	2	a	there's like ten green ones .

8505	2	a	kev's out . 
8506	4	a	47 , 48 , 49 ! jim wins ! 
8507	2	a	okay , okay . 
8508	2	a	okay . 
8509	3	a	pam , depression is as scary as a baler , right ? 
8510	4	a	i don't understand the question . 
8511	3	a	working in an office can lead to depression . which can lead to suicide . i mean this is really serious stuff . 
8512	4	a	yeah . . . 
8513	3	a	i--- i--- nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler , and yet those guys are makin' fun of me , calling me a nerf , that . . . 
8514	4	a	it's really hard to demonstrate depression . their safety training had visuals . 
8515	3	a	yeah . . . you are . . . ah , so right . they had visual aids . and all we had were the facts . you don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity . you go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball , your hair sticks up straight . . . and you know science . 
8516	4	a	so , you're okay ? 
8517	3	a	indubitably . 
8518	3	a	they use props . they use visual aids , and they just made us look like dopes . 
8519	1	a	idiots ! god , what are we gonna do ! ? 
8520	3	a	i don't know , i don't know . because you know what our killer is ? depression---
8521	1	a	wolves .

8526	3	a	no time to sew a quilt . . . . i got it . give me the number for the giant big box toy store . 
8527	1	a	 okay , let's do this thing ! i'll go summon the troops ! 
8528	3	a	maybe we should test it first . letterman-style . throw a tv over , or . . . 
8529	1	a	we measured it once . . . 
8530	3	a	go buy some watermelons . 
8531	1	a	seedless ?

8793	3	a	i know , i know you're angry . and we are truly , truly sorry . 
8794	3	a	well , we are extremely sorry . 
8795	2	a	all right . 
8796	0	a	who was that guy she was talking to ? at her locker . 
8797	2	a	not important . because you're not dating her . because it's a felony . 
8798	0	a	but who
8799	2	a	probably
8800	2	a	absolutely . 
8801	2	a	and you should . 
8802	0	a	 pfft . you don't teach it well enough . one of your students is a

8808	3	a	the watermark . . . it's a one time thing . 
8809	1	a	may i point out that the sex appeared to be consensual ? both animals were smiling .

8817	3	a	no--- my--- ok , this is insane . you can get out of here . get out ! 
8818	3	a	that's insane . we'll give this to somebody who will appreciate it .

8820	3	a	doesn't matter . out please ! 
8821	3	a	yeah , well i'm calling the ungrateful bi-atch hotline ! did you get all that ? 
8822	3	a	we gotta do something . this is spinning out of control , pam . this is just , not . . . 
8823	4	a	it's just the scranton times . . . 
8824	3	a	no , then newsweek picks it up . and then cnn does a story about it . then . . . youtube gets a hold of it . . . 
8825	4	a	you know what ? i really think the whole thing is just gonna blow over in like a week or two . 
8826	3	a	you're right . it will blow over . but it's not . . . going to take . . . a week or two . do you know what this is for ?

8832	1	a	i'm just saying . . . 
8833	3	a	i know . 
8834	1	a	they would flank you . throw in a concussion grenade . 
8835	3	a	i understand that , dwight . 
8836	1	a	you would be on the ground , blind , deaf , dumb . 
8837	3	a	do you think you're taking it a little . . . literally , dwight ? and now we're wasting tape . i'm gonna have to cut this all out . can you say cut ? 
8838	1	a	cut .

8860	2	a	a-wimowheh , a-wimowheh , a-wimowheh , a-wimowheh , a-wimowheh . . . 
8861	0	a	sweet . 
8862	1	a	 pam . 
8863	4	a	hey , dwight . you look really nice today . 
8864	1	a	 pssssh . i look like an idiot . hey karen . 
8865	1	a	yeah , that's cause i'm . . . you're boyfriend , jim halpert . hey , karen , wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend ? 
8866	2	a	do you ? 
8867	2	a	ok .

8869	1	a	i'm jim halpert . 
8870	2	a	spot on . 
8871	1	a	ah-luh-luh , a little comment . muh . 
8872	3	a	the key to a crisis is dealing with it right away . like that aspirin company that sent out the poisoned aspirin in the regular aspirin bottles . if you don't act fast , you will lose customers . 
8873	1	a	hello , cnn ? i need to speak to your scranton-area bureau chief ? all right , then the bureau chief for the greater wilkes-barre area ? how about , ah , lackawanna county . okay , northeastern pennsylvania then . this is extremely urgent ! no . . . you put
8874	0	a	oh , my god ! 
8875	2	a	oh , my god ! wow . 
8876	0	a	i had no idea . 
8877	2	a	then you did nothing wrong . we should go . 
8878	0	a	how could i not have realized ? 
8879	2	a	she looks older . 
8880	0	a	yeah , she does , doesn't she ? 
8881	2	a	no . 
8882	0	a	she acts older , too . she knows everything about european history , and photosynthesis , and she made me this lanyard with , like , a fimo clay thing . she's a real renaissance woman . 
8883	2	a	or a high school girl . let's go . 
8884	0	a	chicken pot pie . 
8885	2	a	what's that ? 
8886	0	a	that's what i was eating , in the parking lot of a 7-eleven for dinner . and i got out of the car to shake the crumbs off my shirt , and this smoking hot woman comes up and we strike up a conversation . 
8887	2	a	oh . you don't have to tell me this . 
8888	0	a	she lets me buy her and her friends some wine coolers for a dinner party she's going to . 
8889	2	a	you shouldn't be talking about that . 
8890	0	a	i threw in some scratch tickets , 'cause generous guy , and next thing you know we're making out in the woods . 
8891	2	a	hypothetically . hypothetically you were making out in the woods . 
8892	0	a	no , we were really making out in the woods . 
8893	2	a	no , can't help you now . 
8894	0	a	i gotta go talk to her . 
8895	2	a	no . d-
8896	3	a	with dissatisfied clients , it doesn't matter what you did . all they wanna hear is that you're sorry . they're like women that way . and this client is a woman . so when i say i'm sorry , it will be twice as effective . 
8897	3	a	so we're good ? 
8898	3	a	i'm sorry . 
8899	1	a	 say you're sorry times infinity . . . 
8900	3	a	okay . 
8901	1	a	 . . . 'cause there's no comeback for that . 
8902	3	a	all right . we are infinitely sorry . 
8903	3	a	you understand ? you . . . you get this check . 
8904	0	a	yeah . i'm mr . bernard johnson , md . i'd like to talk with jamie about a certain heart condition . diagnosis: broken . 
8905	0	a	who's this guy ? 
8906	0	a	you're such a liar . 
8907	0	a	yeah , maybe you should call the police . see whose side they take . warning , most cops are dudes . 
8908	2	a	dr . johnson , we need you in surgery right away . 
8909	1	a	i don't believe in apologies . when someone in the yakuza makes a mistake , they cut off a portion of their own pinky finger . and in that way , save face . and knowing the japanese , they probably get an even better prosthetic finger . with a knife you can take out of it , or a screwdriver or a corkscrew . 
8910	3	a	the customer is always right . mrs . allen was our customer . she was wrong . is that a contradiction ? no . because she's not our customer anymore . 
8911	4	a	michael likes me to run the camera when he makes his apology videos . my favorite is the one for his mother . 
8912	3	a	hey , mom . happy birthday , belatedly . sorry i forgot . i had put it on my calendar and pam threw that out . 
8913	4	a	my personal favorite is the one he made for his condo association . 
8914	3	a	and without denying the seriousness of the situation , i would just like to remind you that in much of the netherlands , swimming naked is the norm . so in norway , you'd be the weirdos . 
8915	2	a	okay , andy , we need to go . seriously . 
8916	0	a	dude , there she is . don't look , don't look . she's sitting with denise . how am i supposed to do this ? denise hates me . 
8917	2	a	don't do it . 
8918	0	a	what is your problem , man ? can't you support a bro ? that's why you don't have any friends , tuna . i'm sorry . i'm sorry . i just , i need . . . 
8919	2	a	that's okay . 
8920	0	a	 . . . your help . i love her . 
8921	2	a	what ? 
8922	0	a	yeah . i lo- i love her . is this what love is ? this , like , horrible feeling in my stomach ? 
8923	2	a	no , that's your conscience . listen to it . 
8924	0	a	look , okay , just be my wingman . beer me five minutes . talk to denise . she's really into white russians and whippets . 
8925	0	a	jamie , can i talk to you for a second ? 
8926	2	a	 so , high school . 
8927	2	a	oh , i don't smoke . sorry . 
8928	2	a	you should take up a musical instrument . 
8929	2	a	hey , uh , does mr . nortman still teach here ? he's a jerk , right ? 
8930	2	a	no , nope . what else ? what else ? you watch the hills ? what is heidi thinking ? 
8931	2	a	how old do you think i am ? 
8932	2	a	not that i know of . 
8933	2	a	i drive a saab station wagon . 
8934	2	a	really ? way to earn it . hey , andy ? 
8935	0	a	what ? 
8936	2	a	yup . 
8937	1	a	very well . i just got a call from debbie brown over at the mill . she claims innocence and is willing to come over here and defend herself . 
8938	1	a	you're right . mercy is for girl-babies . time to put this dog down . 
8939	3	a	are we ready ? 
8940	1	a	final touch-ups . 
8941	3	a	okay . am i shiny ? 
8942	1	a	yeah . 
8943	3	a	okay . we good ? okay , that's enough aqua net . 
8944	1	a	i don't know . . . 
8945	3	a	 stop it . 
8946	2	a	 hey . 
8947	2	a	 oh , what's this ? 
8948	1	a	that is a demerit . 
8949	2	a	 'jim halpert , tardiness . ' ugh . i love it already . 
8950	1	a	you've gotta learn , jim . you are second in command , but that does not put you above the law . 
8951	2	a	oh , i understand . and i also have lots of questions , like , what does a demerit mean ? 
8952	1	a	 let's put it this way . you do not want to receive three of those . 
8953	2	a	lay it on me . 
8954	1	a	three demerits and you'll receive a citation . 
8955	2	a	now that sounds serious . 
8956	2	a	which would be me . 
8957	1	a	that is correct . 
8958	2	a	ok , i want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation . 
8959	1	a	what's a dis . . . what's that ? 
8960	2	a	oh , you don't want to know . 
8961	4	a	 hey , phyllis . you all right ? 
8962	4	a	what ? really ? 
8963	4	a	oh , my god . 
8964	1	a	 move ! 
8965	2	a	ok , i'll call the
8966	0	a	what happened ? what can i do to help ? 
8967	2	a	 ok .

8969	2	a	 thank you . the police are on it . they say they've already had three calls . 
8970	4	a	 can you tell us what happened ? 
8971	4	a	 it's just , like , so creepy .

8973	4	a	oh , some guy exposed himself to phyllis in the parking lot . 
8974	3	a	really ? is she ok ?

8976	3	a	ok . phyllis , you say ? hmm . 
8977	3	a	um . . . i mean did he even see pam ? or , uh . . . karen from behind ? 
8978	3	a	 i'm sorry . it's pretty funny when you think about it . 
8979	2	a	mm . . . not really , no . 
8980	4	a	it's disgusting and demeaning . 
8981	3	a	oh , ok . masters of comedy . a guy dropped his pants . have you ever been to the circus ? ok . he's back ! ok . hmm . waagh ! 
8982	3	a	what ? oh . 
8983	3	a	oh , phyllis got flashed . it's , uh . . . 
8984	3	a	oh , come on . we are laughing at phyllis , but she's not even here , so no harm , no foul . 
8985	3	a	incidentally , where were you during all of this ? maybe you're the flasher . 
8986	3	a	uh-huh . prove it . let's see your penis . i . . . you know , as that was coming out of my mouth , i knew that it was wrong . 
8987	3	a	huh ?

8989	3	a	um , that . . . i don't know . that makes me kind of uncomfortable . 
8990	3	a	i . . . uh , well , i don't know . 
8991	1	a	employees of this office are very small and delicate . deserve protection from local pervs . better 1 , 000 innocent men are locked up than one guilty man roam free . 
8992	3	a	 i am sick over this thing . those people out there are clearly afraid . and that can't happen . not in my house . 
8993	1	a	agreed . let me show you what i've been working on . 
8994	3	a	ok . 
8995	1	a	 there are several penises there i'd love phyllis to run her eyes over . you know , see if we can catch this pervert .

8997	1	a	look at that one . 
8998	3	a	dwight , are those your pants ? that's a polaroid . 
8999	3	a	attention , everybody . dwight has something he would like to say . 
9000	1	a	due to a recent incident involving phyllis , a man , a map , and his penis - i think you know what i'm referring to - michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force . 
9001	2	a	 question . won't that interfere with your other task forces ? 
9002	4	a	phallus ? 
9003	1	a	phyllis , sorry . i've got penises on the brain . back to work , everybody . 
9004	4	a	that's ok . i don't feel like answering phones . 
9005	1	a	attention . i am removing all bananas from the kitchen . 
9006	1	a	desperate times call for desperate measures . 
9007	4	a	 'sleeves down to the wrists , buttoned-up collars , and muted colors . ' nobody dress like that .

9013	1	a	 mm , less than three . 
9014	3	a	that is not current . 
9015	1	a	you know what ? why doesn't oscar run the meeting ? he's a homosexual . 
9016	2	a	why don't you run the meeting ? you play with dolls . 
9017	1	a	those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car . 
9018	3	a	you know what ? i am the expert . i will conduct it . i know the crap out of women . 
9019	3	a	i , um . . . would like to apologize for all of the men who thought this was a laughing matter . 
9020	3	a	nobody likes to be flashed . when meredith flashed me at that christmas party , i nearly vomited . 
9021	3	a	ok , no catfights . please . let's - my point is . . . my point is . . . a penis , when seen in the right context , is the most wonderful sight for a woman . but in the wrong context , it is like a monster movie . 
9022	1	a	alien
9023	0	a	if it were up to me , you ladies would be the fashion models . 
9024	3	a	yes . thank you . that was not necessary , but i appreciated it . and i proves my point . women can do anything . 
9025	3	a	no . i'm being misogynistic . that is insane . i am not being sexist . 
9026	3	a	yes . 
9027	3	a	because wha . . . that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut . 
9028	3	a	i have to know whether you're serious or not . 
9029	1	a	i wish i could menstruate . 
9030	1	a	if i could menstruate , i wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore . i'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle . plus , i'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides . 
9031	3	a	ye - ok , yes . 
9032	3	a	you're right . you're right , you're right . and you know why ? it's because of where we are . this is a masculine environment . we need to find a place where you feel comfortable . you know where we're gonna go ? the steamtown mall . 
9033	3	a	ok , let's go , ladies of dunder-mifflin . hey , we should have a calendar printed up . pam , put that in my good idea folder . let's go !

9046	0	a	i really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today . 
9047	1	a	of course you do , moon face . that's because you're a preppy freak , you're the office pariah , and nobody likes you . so start hanging these all around the building . 
9048	0	a	this guy looks like a real deviant . 
9049	1	a	no , duh . that's why we gotta catch him . start hanging those . 
9050	0	a	aye , aye , cap'n .

9062	4	a	what do you want to dish about ? 
9063	3	a	anything you guys want . this is your time . mm . what is a pap smear ? or is it 'shmear ? ' like the cream cheese . 
9064	4	a	ok . new topic . kelly , how are things with ryan ?

9068	4	a	michael , you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with . 
9069	3	a	jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing . i don't know . maybe we're different people . i like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex . 
9070	4	a	oh , my god . 
9071	3	a	 and then watching it back right afterward to improve my form . 
9072	3	a	no , it's not that bad . the worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it . 
9073	4	a	michael , you need to get out of this . 
9074	3	a	no , she's . . . she's fooling around . it's a woman thing .

9081	3	a	she's totally flat . shrunken chesticles . 
9082	3	a	i'm unhappy when i'm with her . 
9083	4	a	michael . . . you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy . 
9084	3	a	i'm happy sometimes . um . . . when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex . 
9085	3	a	yeah , that's smart . 
9086	4	a	maybe . but it sounds like you're just wrong for each other . 
9087	3	a	that sounds good too . i don't know who's right . i just don't - i don't know . i don't know . 
9088	3	a	i wanna break up with jan . wow . i wanna break up with jan .

9092	3	a	let's face it , most guys are from the dark ages . they're caveman . and they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels , and to be wearing , um , see-through underpants . but . . . for me , a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked . 
9093	3	a	mm . you don't want anything ? my treat . some panties or . . . pick a thong or . . . g-string . t-back . get a nice bra . padded bra . see-through , push-up , lace ? thigh-high ? bustier ? any - it just - you know what , i would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear . 
9094	4	a	i'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now . so i don't need anything sexy . but i do need some new hand towels . i figure i can cut up this robe . 
9095	3	a	oh . oh , no . it's jan . what do i do ? 
9096	4	a	don't answer it .

9277	1	a	damn it ! 
9278	1	a	sabotage . 
9279	1	a	no . i was saying that before . not now . now i am saying sabotage . the ancient dutch art of screwing up your own team . 
9280	1	a	if michael organizes some kind of group hug , stand next to me . 
9281	3	a	it's very simple . there are only three rules . you must not touch the ground . you must not step outside of the ring . and you must always wear the safety mittens . 
9282	3	a	probably left them in the trunk of my car . it's alright . it's alright . here we go . 
9283	3	a	aaaaaand , go ! 
9284	2	a	what are you doing ?

9288	1	a	 gaaaaa . . . . 
9289	3	a	one . two . three . 
9290	1	a	yaaaaa ! yaaaaa ! 
9291	3	a	excellent ! 
9292	1	a	gryffindor ! gryffindor ! 
9293	0	a	i didn't win . but the only reason i didn't win is because i recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words . 
9294	1	a	that's not why you lost . 
9295	0	a	yeah it is . i totally could have kicked your butt so bad . 
9296	1	a	yeah , right . 
9297	0	a	yeah , right , c'mon ! c'mon !

9301	0	a	angela , it's pretty simple ! look at what i'm doing and go tell somebody about it ! 
9302	0	a	angela ! 
9303	4	a	i think they're even . at various times you gave jim ten points , dwight a gold star , and stanley a thumbs up . and i don't really know how to compare those units . 
9304	3	a	check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook . 
9305	4	a	i really doubt it , michael . 
9306	3	a	please just check . 
9307	2	a	 great . yeah , i'll see you next week . thank you , and here is karen filipelli . bye . 
9308	2	a	in well ? 
9309	2	a	how would that work in well ? i just want to know . 
9310	2	a	wait a minute . 
9311	2	a	if this job is in a well , i don't want it . 
9312	2	a	i don't ! 
9313	3	a	what does a great manager need most of all ? courage . 
9314	3	a	your loss , stanley . meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory . walking through fire ! 
9315	3	a	who among you has the guts to replace me ? let him walk across these coals . 
9316	4	a	i'm gonna do it . and i fully expect to burn my feet and go to the hospital . that's the right spirit when doing a coal walk , right ? 
9317	3	a	no . no , not you , pam . you have to keep score . 
9318	4	a	i'd like to try it . 
9319	3	a	pointless . 
9320	4	a	but i'm not kidding . i really want to do it . 
9321	3	a	blah , blah , blee blup , blup , okay ? this is about guts . it takes guts to be a regional manager . jim , you're up . 
9322	2	a	nope . 
9323	3	a	ji . . why not ? c'mon . 
9324	2	a	oh , 'cause i don't want my feet to get burned . 
9325	3	a	you do not have what it takes to be a regional manager . 
9326	2	a	that's harsh . 
9327	3	a	who's next ? andy ? where's andy ? andy is never here today . 
9328	0	a	 hello ? who's there ? my name is andrew bernard , i was with a group called dunder mifflin . hello ? 
9329	3	a	because i already did . remember ? i burned my foot on a george foreman grill . 
9330	2	a	and that is not the same at all . if you're going to ask other people to do it , you should do it yourself . 
9331	3	a	alright . okay . alright . fine . 'kay . the mind has to wrap around the foot . okay . 
9332	4	a	do you want us to count to three ? 
9333	3	a	yes . count to three , please . 
9334	3	a	count the other way . count . . . no , no , count one , two , three , not three , two , one . 
9335	3	a	wait ! am i going on go ? or am i going on three ? 
9336	3	a	okay . 
9337	1	a	no ! it's okay . i will do this michael . 
9338	3	a	don't , don't . 
9339	1	a	 i will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager ! 
9340	1	a	 give me the job ! give me the job ! 
9341	3	a	i'm not going to give it to you . 
9342	1	a	 aaagh , aaagh ! 
9343	4	a	michael , do something ! 
9344	1	a	aggggh , that stings ! 
9345	3	a	being the boss is also about image . i've never looked like that . that was gross . i just , i don't see the connection between a firewalk and management . worst seventy-five bucks i ever spent . you know what , if i had to pick my replacement based on today , it would be mr . 'outside hire . '
9346	3	a	god ! he's a comedian . 
9347	3	a	who's amanda bynes ? 
9348	3	a	oh , i love that movie . yes , kelly is right , the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a bynes or a hope . so without further ado , jim and dwight show us what you got . 
9349	2	a	hey , i know what you're looking for , but um , i got to be honest , i really don't think i should be considered as your replacement . 
9350	3	a	you are being too modest . 
9351	2	a	michael , on thursday i'm going to drive down and interview with david for the open position in new york . 
9352	3	a	hhhh . . . okay . that is not funny . i am deducting sixty points from voldemort for false pretenses . okay , dwight your turn . wow us . 
9353	1	a	the aristocrats . a man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency . and the talent agent says , 'describe your act . ' and the man says something really , really raunchy and the talent representative says , 'what do you call yourselves ? ' and the man says , 'the aristocrats ! '
9354	4	a	 oooh , uh hah , ooh ! wha-hoo ! ahhhh . . . 
9355	1	a	 i mean truly repulsive acts . 
9356	3	a	that is a very , very funny story . 
9357	3	a	pam , that was amazing . but i am still looking for someone with a sales background . 
9358	3	a	wwwwiiiillllmmmmaaaa ! 
9359	0	a	nice ! 
9360	3	a	so we have about an hour and a half . i suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the party bus . fun on wheels . only way to travel . besides a monorail . 
9361	3	a	no . no , no , no . no guests today . classic gang only . just us good friends , and karen and andy . 
9362	4	a	sometimes michael gets nostalgic and he talks about the classic gang . that's michael , me , jim , dwight , angela , kevin , oscar , stanley , phyllis , creed , meredith , kelly and ryan . we're a regular ocean's eleven . 
9363	4	a	jim , david wallace is calling for you . 
9364	2	a	oh , okay . hello . hey , david . sure . 
9365	3	a	pam , you broke up with your boyfriend and then kept working together . how did that work out ? 
9366	4	a	you remember you fired roy for attacking jim and i don't talk to him anymore really . 
9367	3	a	acrimonious . 
9368	3	a	this way to the party bus . good . 
9369	3	a	it's a bus that takes you to a party . here we go . 
9370	3	a	here we go . come on . okay , everybody here ? 
9371	3	a	then , mr . driver , we are off like a herd of turtles ! johnny carson . 
9372	1	a	seat belts fastened , folks . safety first . hey what is all this ? 
9373	3	a	nothing . 
9374	1	a	if i guess , will you tell me ? 
9375	3	a	no . 
9376	1	a	please ? 
9377	3	a	no ! 
9378	1	a	is that a sumo suit ? 
9379	3	a	no . 
9380	1	a	i know , we're putting on a play for japanese investors . 
9381	3	a	no , we are not . 
9382	1	a	please tell me . i've been so good . . . 
9383	3	a	you are really annoying me . if you don't knock it off . . . 
9384	1	a	please . 
9385	3	a	 . . . i'm never gonna tell you anything ever again . stop it ! stop it ! stop it ! 
9386	1	a	please . 
9387	3	a	no . we're only 10 minutes from the lake . 
9388	3	a	yes , i am choosing my apprentice . which is why i have modeled all my games after survivor . 
9389	3	a	any questions ? 
9390	2	a	just one . 
9391	3	a	yup . 
9392	2	a	the torches are lit . 
9393	3	a	yes , for dramatic affect . 
9394	2	a	no , michael , people are blindfolded . that's a hazard . 
9395	3	a	very good , jim . pam , please note that jim is very astute . all right , are we ready ? 
9396	2	a	are you not gonna put out the torches ? 
9397	3	a	set ! 
9398	2	a	okay . 
9399	3	a	go ! 
9400	0	a	it is an honor just to be considered for michael's job . honestly . and if i win it , then i will be ordering a pretty sizeable most improved player plaque to put over the hole i punched in the wall . 
9401	3	a	 okay . pam , who came out best in the race , in your opinion ? 
9402	4	a	um , karen left her blindfold on the longest but she also threw her egg at jim . 
9403	3	a	because he wasn't following the rules . 
9404	4	a	i think they were just having fun . 
9405	3	a	but they didn't complete their task , pam ! if people can't carry an egg in a spoon , blindfolded , then what does that tell you about how they will be able to manage a sales report , or conduct a business call ? 
9406	4	a	it tells me nothing . 
9407	3	a	exactly . are you sure you're doing that right ? taking an awfully long time . 
9408	4	a	there's 800 of them ! 
9409	3	a	okay , all right . 
9410	3	a	it's very important that you all try to eat as many hotdogs as you can . . . 
9411	3	a	son of a bitch . god ! okay . all right you know what ? here we go . on your mark ! get set ! 
9412	3	a	no mustard ! no mustard ! just . . . eat it . eat it , phyllis . dip it in the water so it will slide down your gullet more easily . 
9413	3	a	no , no , no , no , not that--- just . . . come on , you guys , let's do it ! i'm serious . who's got the hungry ? 
9414	1	a	i do ! 
9415	3	a	who's got the hungry ? 
9416	1	a	i do ! 
9417	3	a	come on , ryan . . . 
9418	1	a	let's go .

9420	2	a	karen and i are having our own contest to see who can eat the most normal amount of tuna salad in an unspecified but very cofortable amount of time . i don't know what to tell you . right now ? dead heat . 
9421	0	a	keep eating tuna , big tuna . loser !

9863	3	a	 oh , sh . . . i'm sorry angela . man what a day huh ? how could it get any worse ? her computer crashes with the porn , and then meredith with the accident , and then . . . sprinkles ! god , that's 3 things . i'll tell you what's going on . this office is cursed , and we need to do something about it . 
9864	3	a	well , i am taking responsibility . it is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit meredith with my car . i'm not superstitious , but . . . i'm . . . i am a little-stitious . 
9865	3	a	did anyone do anything involving an indian burial ground ? 
9866	3	a	like park on it . or dig up a body . . . toby ? anything you want to tell us ? 
9867	4	a	that's cool . 
9868	3	a	perfect . so our tragedy is your good luck . satan . 
9869	1	a	she's only a cat . 
9870	1	a	cats do not provide milk or wool or meat . 
9871	3	a	dwight , you haven't seen meredith yet , have you ? 
9872	1	a	no , i have not . 
9873	3	a	well , i think you should go to the hospital , and pay your respects . 
9874	1	a	i do not respect her , but i will go . 
9875	3	a	alright , i would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs . 
9876	3	a	satan is a master of lies . everything he says is the opposite . 
9877	3	a	thank you for the permission . psych ! alright let's just go around the room , and tell me what you believe in . 
9878	3	a	ok . 
9879	3	a	alright . 
9880	4	a	oh me too . 
9881	4	a	 same religion . 
9882	3	a	kelly , you are hindu , so you believe in buddha . 
9883	3	a	are you sure ? 
9884	3	a	what are you ? 
9885	3	a	ok , 1 sikh , and . . . 
9886	1	a	as a farmer , i know that when an animal is sick , sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery . with the electricity we're using to keep meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days . you tell me what's unethical . 
9887	1	a	blink once if you want me to pull the plug . 
9888	1	a	are you a doctor , or a male nurse ? 
9889	1	a	pfft . . . her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did , or at least she got time off for one . 
9890	1	a	just doing my job . 
9891	3	a	you spend your whole life trying to get people to like you , and then you run over one person with your car . and it's not even one of the popular ones , and everybody gets on your case . doesn't make any sense . . . god is dead . 
9892	2	a	i will do some research . 
9893	4	a	i can help you with that . 
9894	1	a	so , just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine . 
9895	3	a	oh god , rabies ? 
9896	1	a	mm-hmm . 
9897	3	a	i was in the hospital room with her . how contagious is that , is that like an std ? 
9898	1	a	no , no . you've gotta be bitten by something . 
9899	3	a	this place is so cursed . 
9900	1	a	actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital , cause the only way to beat rabies , is to start treatment before the symptoms set in . . . lock jaw . 
9901	3	a	 i know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering meredith's life by hitting her , with my car . but it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened , dwight endangered her life , by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it . 
9902	2	a	six of one , really . 
9903	3	a	is there a god ? if not , what are all the churches for ? and who is jesus' dad ? 
9904	4	a	michael scott's dunder-mifflin , scranton , meredith palmer memorial , celebrity rabies awareness , fun run race for the cure , this is pam . 
9905	3	a	pro-am . 
9906	4	a	pro-am race for the . . . they hung up . 
9907	3	a	hi stanley , how many sponsors so far ? 
9908	3	a	come on man , gotta step it up ! it's for a good cause . jan called this morning and pledged $500 . 00 . 
9909	0	a	isn't that your money ? 
9910	3	a	that . . . is for a good cause . phyllis , how's the rabies quilt coming ? 
9911	3	a	oh , look at that , 3 . way to honor meredith , phyllis . 
9912	3	a	yes . 
9913	3	a	ok . 
9914	3	a	alright , alright . 
9915	3	a	shhh . . . 
9916	3	a	i know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts . 
9917	3	a	ok , well back in olden times , a large fat person , like this , was a person of power . a person who had money , could buy food , person of respect . like the regional manager of the day . whereas , someone athletic and trim , like myself , was someone who worked in the fields . . . and i was a peasant . 
9918	3	a	well , you're going to have to run , or you're going to be in a lot of trouble . it is not olden times anymore . 
9919	0	a	 i'm petrified of nipple chafing . once it starts it is a vicious circle . if you have sensitive nipples , they chafe , so they become more sensitive , so they chafe more . so . . . i take precautions . 
9920	0	a	hey angela . hey , um . . . i'm sorry about your cat . 
9921	4	a	what's wrong ? 
9922	4	a	hmm . . . 
9923	4	a	ah . 
9924	4	a	angela , i'm sorry . 
9925	4	a	i'm more of a dog person . 
9926	2	a	so what's your strategy for this race ? 
9927	4	a	well i'm gonna start fast . 
9928	2	a	mm-hmm . 
9929	4	a	then i'm gonna run fast in the middle . 
9930	2	a	what ? 
9931	4	a	then i'm gonna end fast . 
9932	2	a	why won't more people do that ? 
9933	4	a	cause they're just stupid . 
9934	2	a	 what ? 
9935	2	a	 oh , ah . . . no that's not . . . i mean that wasn't , ah . . . 
9936	4	a	yeah . . . that was um . . . 
9937	2	a	i mean i can see how it would seem a bit like we uh . . . how it looks like um . . . i mean now a days you can edit anything , right ? i mean you can edit anything to look like um . . . anything . 
9938	4	a	yeah , i gave him a ride home because . . . 
9939	2	a	right ! 
9940	4	a	 . . . we're dating . 
9941	2	a	wow ! there it is . 
9942	4	a	ah , yeah . we haven't told anybody , but it's going really great . right ? 
9943	2	a	it is going really great . 
9944	1	a	 oww ! 
9945	1	a	you're taking this out on me , but i was only the messenger . 
9946	1	a	 you'll feel better after the 5k . exercise is good for depression . 
9947	3	a	we have raised , almost $700 . 00 , most of it from me and jan . um . . . when do they put that on the giant check ? or is that something that we write in later ? 
9948	4	a	well a giant check costs about $200 . 00 to make up . i have a print shop standing by but . . . what do you think michael , that's over 25% of our funds ? 
9949	3	a	hmm . . . that's a tough decision . um . . . i always imagined it with a giant check . so . . . 
9950	2	a	yeah , i mean i personally am definitely on board for the giant check . 
9951	4	a	giant check it is . 
9952	2	a	yeah . 
9953	3	a	yep . 
9954	1	a	well i don't know , on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control . 
9955	2	a	bat birth control
9956	1	a	wait , this money is going to bat birth control , right michael , that's what you told me when i contributed . 
9957	3	a	you didn't contribute very much . i was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor . and how's that been going ? 
9958	4	a	not well . a doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700 . 00 , or $500 . 00 if we go with the giant check . 
9959	2	a	which we are . 
9960	4	a	and also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor . 
9961	3	a	what about a rabies nurse ? 
9962	4	a	i don't think so . 
9963	2	a	you know what though , i've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour , for parties and bachelor events . 
9964	3	a	that's possible . look into that . 
9965	2	a	great , it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah . . . oh actually more with tips . 
9966	1	a	maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for meredith's son . 
9967	3	a	have you met that kid ? he's not going to college . 
9968	4	a	michael , 5k means 5 kilometers , not 5 thousand miles . 
9969	3	a	come in . 
9970	4	a	hey . 
9971	3	a	hey , hey , hey
9972	4	a	oh my god . 
9973	3	a	what are you doing ? 
9974	4	a	you said come in ! 
9975	3	a	no i didn't , just please don't . . . 
9976	4	a	oh my god . 
9977	4	a	so i closed the door but the image of his . . . 
9978	2	a	baquette . 
9979	4	a	 . . . dangling participle . . . 
9980	2	a	eww . 
9981	4	a	 . . . still burned in my eyes . 
9982	2	a	i can imagine . 
9983	4	a	 come in . 
9984	3	a	may i enter the room ? 
9985	4	a	yes . or come in . 
9986	3	a	see how i did that . that's the way you should enter a room . you knock and then you wait for the all clear . 
9987	2	a	you couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room ? 
9988	3	a	yes , but i have an office , so why would i do that . 
9989	4	a	on average , how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office ? just ballpark . 
9990	3	a	european offices are naked all the time . 
9991	4	a	they're so not . 
9992	3	a	besides my shirt tail covered most of it so . . . 
9993	4	a	i didn't see where it started but i saw where it ended . 
9994	2	a	 gross . 
9995	2	a	alright . 
9996	4	a	they say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked . i do not recommend this strategy . try picturing them with more clothes on . . . or a funny coat . 
9997	2	a	 oh , i'm sorry , is this a working office , and not a french beach ? 
9998	3	a	check that out . look at me , i'm toby , i'm stretching , i know what i'm doing . why is he even here ? 
9999	4	a	what ? look , no it was not . . . 
10000	3	a	no , don't give him . . . just , did you hear anything i said ? 
10001	3	a	he's happy because he's insane . you know what , that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate . where's the nurse ? this is the reason we're here . 
10002	3	a	oh hey , i know you . . . elizabeth ? 
10003	3	a	right ? wow , very cool you went back and got your degree . i would like you to accept this check , for $340 . 00 made out to science . make sure that , that gets into the right hands . 
10004	3	a	you got it ? 
10005	1	a	mm-hmm . 
10006	3	a	ok , fettuccine alfredo , time to carbo-load . 
10007	3	a	just remember folks , it's not about winning , it is about finishing . 
10008	1	a	on your marks , get set . . . 
10009	3	a	 beow ! 
10010	3	a	on your left ! 
10011	3	a	i am fast ! i'm very fast ! i'm like forrest gump , except i am not an idiot . 
10012	0	a	i've walked 2 marathons . pretty sure i can handle a 5k . key is drafting , eliminate wind resistance . 
10013	4	a	yeah . oh we're in last place . 
10014	2	a	oh , would you look at that . 
10015	4	a	darn it . 
10016	3	a	no , no water for me . not while rabies causes fear of water . . . solidarity ! 
10017	3	a	rabies victims . . . have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives . so . . . least i could do . 
10018	0	a	oh god ! my nipples , it's starting . 
10019	3	a	that fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock . 
10020	1	a	you've got nothing to worry about , i put imodium in toby's coffee before the race . 
10021	3	a	 excellent ! . . . simpsons . wait , imodium or ex-lax ? 
10022	2	a	ooo ! an estate sale . wanna go in ? 
10023	4	a	i don't know i'm really committed to winning . 
10024	2	a	ok , but what if i told you all the money you spend here , goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured . 
10025	4	a	mmm . . . yes . 
10026	2	a	that's what i thought . 
10027	4	a	yeah . 
10028	2	a	right . let's do some good . 
10029	3	a	 oh god , oh , alfredo sauce . i'm getting a stitch . 
10030	0	a	 ah , god watch the nipples , kevin . 
10031	1	a	how ya feeling , better ? 
10032	1	a	well you look cute as a button . you've worked up quite a sweat . 
10033	1	a	i am a farmer angela . 
10034	1	a	ok , when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain , that has no quality of life , that has no utility , a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do . 
10035	1	a	i . . . i sang her , her favorite songs . 
10036	1	a	it was beautiful and gentle and respectful . i fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep . 
10037	1	a	well i'm not responsible for that ! 
10038	1	a	hey , oww ! it's ok . 
10039	1	a	it's nothing , i'm robbing her . 
10040	1	a	it's fine . what ? 
10041	1	a	i thought i was helping you . i expected a hug . i took care of that cat , the best way i knew how . 
10042	1	a	i know a great taxidermist . i'll pay to have her stuffed . well he's not great , but he's pretty good . 
10043	3	a	 take bat bites seriously . don't get bit . 
10044	1	a	or we can have her buried out at the east field , by mother . huh , angela ? 
10045	4	a	 you like it ? it's kinda designy and cool , it was $8 . 00 . 
10046	2	a	oh , and i get to carry it . 
10047	3	a	 i am not going to finish . i can't beat rabies . nobody can beat rabies , rabies has been around for a thousand years . i was a fool to think that i could beat it . 
10048	2	a	 . . . talk about it . 
10049	4	a	yeah probably . hey , michael ? 
10050	2	a	what are you doing here ? did you come back for us , or . . . 
10051	3	a	i can't finish . i feel so weak , i just . . . 
10052	2	a	well , you're probably dehydrated . 
10053	3	a	what do you want me to do jim ? 
10054	2	a	glass of water would be a start . 
10055	2	a	wow ! you are a downer . we were having a pretty nice day . 
10056	4	a	i'm still having a nice day . 
10057	2	a	you are ? 
10058	4	a	yeah . hey michael , look at this lamp . $8 . 00 . 
10059	3	a	that's a good deal . 
10060	4	a	and michael , you don't have rabies . and chances are you're not going to get it anytime soon . so . . . you don't really have to think about it too much . 
10061	3	a	pam , if everybody felt that way , nothing would get done . 
10062	4	a	yeah , but there's other , better people out there who are helping . 
10063	3	a	you just don't think i am capable , of making a difference . 
10064	4	a	i know you michael , i saw you naked . 
10065	3	a	you don't , you don't know me . you've just seen my penis . i can make a difference , remember , i'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting meredith with my car . and i owe it to her to finish this . . . gd 5k no , no ! 
10066	3	a	hey mer . how ya doing ? 
10067	3	a	it's ironic isn't it ? i mean i'm in the hospital for not getting enough water , and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water . 
10068	3	a	thanks , i'm not mad at you anymore . wanna share ? 
10069	3	a	i'm not really sick . nah , i'm good . 
10070	3	a	did you ever think of this ? would a sober person walk in front of a car ? 
10071	0	a	ay-o ! 
10072	2	a	i'm sorry , are you saying that meredith was drunk at 9 am ? 
10073	3	a	well . . . 
10074	4	a	michael . 
10075	3	a	that's not . . . 
10076	3	a	that's not what . . . no , no , i'm not saying that , that's disgusting . 
10077	0	a	then . . . what are you saying ? 
10078	3	a	i am saying . . . that . . . maybe i was drunk . did you ever think of that ? 
10079	2	a	definitely not . 
10080	3	a	okay . 
10081	3	a	maybe she hit me . you ever think of that ? she hit me ? i don't know whose fault it was . i wasn't exactly looking at the road . 
10082	4	a	hey , toby . 
10083	4	a	kelly , we're going to visit meredith at lunch . kelly ? 
10084	3	a	you know what , why don't go around the room and say one memory of meredith . i'll start . i liked her jumpers . they reminded me of kindergarten . jim ? 
10085	0	a	so , how's the view old girl ? oh ! there's a cemetery . you think that's affiliated with the hospital , or is it a like a separate feature . . . 
10086	3	a	hey ! okay , okay , okay , you can just close that . 
10087	3	a	let's just . . . why can't you just forgive . . . why , why are you having such a hard time laughing this off ? how do you know that you weren't born with some sort of abnormal pelvis that it was just bound to crack at some point ? 
10088	3	a	i'm not going to leave until you forgive me . 
10089	3	a	 oh , okay . 
10090	3	a	this office is cursed . and we need to do something about it . 
10091	2	a	conference room ? 
10092	3	a	maybe the conference room , maybe the annex . i'm just saying , at least right here is cursed . conference room , 10 minutes . 
10093	3	a	on the one hand , it's a relief to know that it's not just me , the whole office is cursed . on the other hand , i may have to deal with the dark unknown . 
10094	1	a	question: has anyone recently offended a gypsy ? 
10095	3	a	we have to have done something wrong . 
10096	3	a	that was the curse , stanley , and we are trying to find the cause of the curse . 
10097	1	a	mmm . 
10098	3	a	oscar , are you santaria ? 
10099	3	a	oh . great . we have a secular humanist here , that is disgusting . 
10100	3	a	yes . it is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition . 
10101	3	a	stupid . 
10102	1	a	my cousin mose's best friend was a dog . one day , he was foaming at the mouth , so i had to shoot him dead . turns out , he had only eaten one of mose's cream pies . did i feel bad for killing him ? no . that's how you deal with a thief . 
10103	3	a	whoa , 'scuse me ! oh ! 
10104	3	a	oh , slow ! oh , ho , ho , ho . you guys are going so slow . . . 
10105	3	a	come on , i'm going backwards . 
10106	3	a	oh , all right ! all right ! all right ! all right ! 
10107	3	a	okay ! 
10108	3	a	thanks . 
10109	3	a	well , apparently , my insurance will not be covering this hospital stay . i will be paying out-of-pocket . um . . . i kinda wish i'd been hit by a car . 
10110	3	a	hey , doc ? you forgetting something ? thank you . 
10111	4	a	hey .

10132	2	a	ohh . . 
10133	4	a	phone's ringing .

10135	1	a	i don't see it . i think they both could do better . 
10136	0	a	jim halpert's off the market . guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office ? 
10137	3	a	hey . can you make that straighter ? that's what she said . 
10138	3	a	no . 
10139	4	a	 can you make that straighter ? that job looks hard . you should put your mouth on that . how can you even use that one naturally ? 
10140	3	a	blowing up balloons i thought . 
10141	4	a	you might want to trim it a little . 
10142	4	a	yeah , he is . 
10143	3	a	pam and jim are together . ryan is visiting . only thing that could make this day better is ice cream . 
10144	1	a	to give you this . 
10145	1	a	it's a feral barn cat . i trapped him last night and i'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one i destroyed . 
10146	1	a	and his name is . . . garbage . mose calls him garbage because he likes to eat garbage . don't you garbage ?

10204	3	a	 hey , what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles ? 
10205	3	a	i don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids . 
10206	3	a	oh , i dunno , they're launching a big new business plan . new website , blah blah blah . he's being a real twerp about it , so , it's all about youth , and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people . 
10207	3	a	well . . . 
10208	3	a	what is that . . . word ? 
10209	3	a	so older people have just as many rights as younger people ? 
10210	4	a	michael told us to wait in here . we don't know why . 
10211	3	a	good , we're all here , we can get started . 
10212	3	a	have a seat . 
10213	3	a	have a seat . like everybody else . 
10214	3	a	hey , shut up toby . look , why do we as a society hate old people so much ? 
10215	3	a	no , creed , no they are not . in fact , many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability . like the old lady from titanic . or the funny things that they can do , like 'where's the beef ? ' yeah . 
10216	2	a	why do you have the big picture up again ? you used that already , when you burned your foot . 
10217	4	a	reusing the ben kingsley , too . 
10218	3	a	i was going to put up some new pictures , but umm , all of the ink in the printer was gone . 
10219	4	a	oh . 
10220	3	a	 that is me . come on in . who is this old fart ? did you just stagger off the street ? out of a box or something ? who's this worthless bag of bones ? well , this guy is none other than one of the founders of dunder mifflin , mr . robert dunder . huh ? 
10221	1	a	oh , yeah . yes ! 
10222	3	a	sure thing . 'scuse me . 
10223	3	a	fine . then i will call david wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt . 
10224	3	a	bob , how old are you ? 
10225	3	a	eighty-seven years young . and still active . that is great . did you know , that bob is still a member of the board of dunder mifflin ? 
10226	3	a	ah , still sends his own proxy . good for you . 
10227	1	a	i'm gonna live for a very long time . my grandma schrute lived to be 101 . my grandpa manheim is 103 , and still puttering around in argentina . i tried to go visit him once , but my travel visa was protested by the shoah foundation .

10233	3	a	perfect . 
10234	3	a	inspirational . what have we learned ? well , we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks , because it's illegal , and you will go to jail . 
10235	4	a	i think that i should help him get home . 
10236	3	a	no , no . don't help him . he doesn't need help , pam . what a nice guy . 
10237	3	a	good night guys . 
10238	3	a	i disagree , i think it was very valuable . 
10239	3	a	i happen to think the old ways of doing business are better . and i can prove it . 
10240	1	a	are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles ? 
10241	1	a	dry . delicious . 
10242	1	a	oh , that's funny . 
10243	1	a	are you enjoying your mineral water ? 
10244	1	a	then don't look in my eyes . look right here , it's an old sales trick . 
10245	1	a	no , please don't do this , monkey .

10254	0	a	mmhmm , sweet , chocolate turtles . 
10255	3	a	yes , no ! no , those are for our clients . actually , our exclients . i'll explain , later . 
10256	3	a	ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and im's , but i think he's forgetting about the original instant message . letters attatched to baskets of food . 
10257	1	a	excuse me , angela . michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items . 
10258	1	a	you're welcome .

10263	4	a	hey . 
10264	2	a	alright i just have to ask now that we're public , um , is the magic gone ? 
10265	4	a	it's funny you bring that up because yes it is . 
10266	2	a	i knew it . oh man , just like that huh ? 
10267	4	a	i think . . . i mean , i don't know what it is but . . . 
10268	2	a	be honest . 
10269	4	a	i now find you repulsive . 
10270	2	a	that's honest . alright , fair enough . it was really fun while it lasted though , wasn't it ? 
10271	4	a	eh . . . 
10272	2	a	for me , it was . 
10273	4	a	ok . 
10274	2	a	alright . 
10275	3	a	hey boss , i didn't know you were coming in today . 
10276	3	a	i am glad that you asked , listen up everybody . in the last year , we have lost seven clients to the big chains . these gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives . we are going to show up at these businesses unannounced , and we are going to win them back . 
10277	3	a	with peanut brittle , with macadamia nut cookies , with chocolate turtles , with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what ? that's what people like . 
10278	3	a	ok . we're gonna split up into teams . jim , phyllis . stanley , dwight . me andy . 
10279	0	a	i'll go with you stanley . 
10280	2	a	why don't we just go by ourselves ? 
10281	3	a	why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship ? 
10282	3	a	yes ? 
10283	3	a	ok , that's not helpful phyllis . 
10284	3	a	gift baskets are amazing , phyllis . gift baskets are . . . the essence of class and fanciness . they are the ultimate present that a person can recieve . 
10285	0	a	what about cash ? with cash you can buy anything you want , including a gift basket , so . . . it's kind of the best gift ever . 
10286	2	a	what about a gift basket full of cash ? 
10287	0	a	yes ! cash basket ! nice work tuna . 
10288	3	a	fine , i'm just going to go by myself , and i am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me .

10302	1	a	larry myers . left us six months ago for office depot . 
10303	1	a	why do you use that thing ? let's them know where you are at all times . 
10304	3	a	who ? 
10305	1	a	the government , spy satellites , private detectives . . . exgirlfriends . 
10306	0	a	dude , you are so money , but you don't even know it , but you do . 
10307	0	a	later man . 
10308	2	a	yeah , he's definitely something . 
10309	2	a	that whole lifestyle , his whole vibe , you find that appealing ? 
10310	0	a	ha ! tuna . . . tuna tuna tuna . 
10311	0	a	he has a killer job , he's rich , he smells like what i think pierce brosnan probably smells like , he wears really cool rich guy clothes . 
10312	0	a	so , sorry tuna but if you don't know why that's awesome . . . then . . . you need awesome lessons . 
10313	3	a	 wow , those things are heavy ! there's a lot of stuff in there . we have macadamia nut cookies , um , the honey mustard pretzels . have you ever tried focaccia crisps ? 
10314	3	a	yes we do . 
10315	1	a	yes , yes we know but we just have not gotten over you . 
10316	3	a	well . . . 
10317	1	a	and we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service , the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us . 
10318	3	a	mmhmm . 
10319	1	a	please , come back . 
10320	3	a	ok , you know what ? just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch . 
10321	1	a	remember what we had larry ? 
10322	3	a	well just , uh enjoy the gift basket . 
10323	3	a	alright . 
10324	3	a	 that guy was so . . . how can they not know how much better we are ? 
10325	1	a	i don't know . sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable . 
10326	3	a	that is true . 
10327	1	a	like angela in accounting . 
10328	3	a	yes , she is nuts . 
10329	1	a	ugh . . . no , she's wonderful . . . at accounting . but she drives me crazy . 
10330	3	a	how do they know ? how does this know where to turn ? that's very impressive . 
10331	4	a	uh totally . 
10332	4	a	yeah . 
10333	4	a	thank you . 
10334	4	a	ok . 
10335	4	a	yeah , i'm gonna do some mock ups , and then turn those into thumbnails , maybe do some . . . splash frames . i don't know what i'm talking about but i'm excited . 
10336	3	a	and the last guy says 'no , hairy body' . 
10337	3	a	ah , well it's still very good . i bet i know someone who hasn't heard that joke . . . your daughter emily . how's she doing ? 
10338	3	a	ok , ok ! so you'll reconsider ? 
10339	3	a	ah . . . . is that all you have to say ? 
10340	1	a	you don't know ? 
10341	3	a	look , we want you back . 
10342	3	a	well , no . 
10343	1	a	he's not coming back , it's over michael . 
10344	3	a	no it's not . 
10345	1	a	accept it , why would he come back ? 
10346	3	a	why would he come back ? i will tell you , dwight . he would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us . 
10347	1	a	that's not gonna change his mind . he's moving on . we had our chance and we killed it . 
10348	3	a	look . . . we're also coming out with a website soon . it's a state of the art thing , it'll be up and running , it's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier . 
10349	3	a	great , the magic of the gift basket . 
10350	3	a	ok , good . don't let emily have any of the cajun almonds , she's alergic . 
10351	1	a	 well we're o for six . last chance is the elmhurst country club . other side of the lake , on the southeast side . 
10352	3	a	i don't get it , i really don't get it . i thought this would work . i do everything i had at that guy and nothing . 
10353	1	a	that's how it goes sometimes , you know ? you lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you . 
10354	3	a	that is a very good point , dwight . 
10355	1	a	wait wait wait ! no no no ! it means bear right , up there . 
10356	3	a	no , it said right , it said take a right . 
10357	1	a	no no no , look , it means go up to the right , bare right , over the bridge and hook up with 307 . 
10358	3	a	maybe it's a shortcut dwight . it said go to the right . 
10359	1	a	it can't mean that ! there's a lake there ! 
10360	3	a	the machine knows where it is going ! 
10361	1	a	this is the lake ! 
10362	3	a	the machine knows--- stop yelling at me ! 
10363	1	a	no , it's--- there's no road here ! 
10364	1	a	remain calm ! i have trained for this ! okay , exit the window ! here we go ! look out for leeches ! are you okay ? ! swim for it ! i got you ! michael ! michael ! 
10365	3	a	let go , let go of me ! 
10366	1	a	i got you , i got you ! 
10367	3	a	 you sure you're ok ? 
10368	1	a	fine . 
10369	3	a	good , that is what's most important . 
10370	1	a	did you get the rental insurance ? because that is pretty important too at a time like this . 
10371	3	a	what a disaster , this whole thing . 
10372	1	a	i'll call a cab . 
10373	3	a	these people just don't realize what a gift basket means , they don't get it . 
10374	1	a	look at that , still works . old fashioned cell phone . 
10375	3	a	what about that last guy , aaron ? is he a jerk . 'i don't even know if i want it . they're website is so easy' . yeah , well , you can have your technology jackass , look where it got us . 
10376	1	a	 yes , we need a cab at lake scranton , at the end of east mountain road , in the lake . 
10377	3	a	hang up . you know what we're gonna do ? we're walking back . we're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket ! 
10378	1	a	yes ! 
10379	3	a	we're gonna take what's rightfully ours ! we're gonna take a stand , dwight ! we're gonna take a stand ! 
10380	1	a	take a stand ! 
10381	4	a	so place it on the infinity thing without being obvious , you know ? i'd love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo . 
10382	4	a	thanks . 
10383	4	a	that'd be great . 
10384	4	a	oh . . . is it . . . 
10385	4	a	no . . . 
10386	4	a	um . . . 
10387	4	a	i'm uh , i'm dating jim . 
10388	4	a	we're together . 
10389	4	a	yeah , great . 
10390	4	a	ok great ! 
10391	4	a	great . 
10392	2	a	i guess he can't get any girl he wants . 
10393	3	a	give it back . the gift basket , give it back . 
10394	1	a	it's real simple . if you don't appreciate what we do , then give us back our basket . 
10395	3	a	yeah , maybe we should , maybe we should leave . come on , let's leave , but before we leave my wet friend and i are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches ! 
10396	1	a	can you call us a cab please , i'm gonna oops , sorry ! 
10397	3	a	look , my clothes are so wet ! 
10398	1	a	nice leather , oh my shoes are so muddy ! 
10399	3	a	it's been opened . 
10400	3	a	what's missing . . . the turtles . where are the turtles ? where are the turtles ? 
10401	3	a	where are the turtles ? where are they ? 
10402	1	a	 excuse me i have an announcement to make . we seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons , and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them . hand . over . the . turtles . now ! 
10403	1	a	 we'll bill you . 
10404	3	a	may i have your attention please ? this office will not be using any new technology ever , starting now . 
10405	3	a	ryan thinks that technology is the answer . well guess what ? i just drove my car into a lake . 
10406	3	a	i drove my car into a lake . why you may ask did i do this ? well , because of a machine . a machine told me to drive into a lake . and i did it ! i did it because i trusted ryan's precious technology , and look where it got me . 
10407	2	a	into a lake . 
10408	3	a	exactly ! 
10409	3	a	maybe , maybe not , time will tell . but i will tell you one thing . those gift baskets never endangered anybody's lives . game set match . . . point . . . scott . . . game over . . . end of game . 
10410	3	a	everyone always wants new things . everybody likes new inventions , new technology . people will never be replaced by machines . in the end , life and business are about human connections . and computers are about trying to murder you in a lake . and to me the choice is easy . 
10411	2	a	i know . i love it there . 
10412	2	a	mmhmm , yeah , last time i was there i had a lot of fun . 
10413	2	a	sounds great . 
10414	2	a	yeee . . . 
10415	3	a	oh , okay . okay . just . . . well , our old friend ryan howard is back , and we're going to give a little presentation about the future of our company . so please listen up . all right . 
10416	3	a	you don't want me to help ? 
10417	3	a	yes ? 
10418	4	a	i got it . 
10419	3	a	 um . . . yes , i'll be right back ! 
10420	2	a	that was slightly harsh , don't you think ? 
10421	3	a	i think i know what's going on . ryan believes that there is some sort of special 'boss water' that he gets to drink now . and there isn't . but , um . . . don't tell him . don't tell him that . i don't want to jeopardize our friendship . 
10422	3	a	ryan is causing some problems . and you were always good at handling him . what should i do to control him ? 
10423	3	a	i know , i know , no , what . . . something else . 
10424	3	a	uh-huh . 
10425	3	a	good . 
10426	3	a	my generation's all about hard work and accomplishment . like . . . the moon landing . or vietnam . rolling stones . greatest band ever . 
10427	3	a	no , i skipped through all of the boring stuff and went right to his joke page . which proves that he was old , but he was also hilarious . 
10428	3	a	i'm not . it's solitaire . see ? 
10429	3	a	blackberry . why would anyone name something like this after a fruit ? you wouldn't name an ipod after a fruit . excuse me while i type on my banana . i'm gonna go to the orange store and buy an apricot computer . apple . 
10430	3	a	this is going on the outside . the pipe cleaner needs to go through the corner . do not tape those on . 
10431	4	a	hey , michael .

10435	4	a	sure . 
10436	4	a	michael doesn't know how to work his blackberry . so when he says blackberry me a message , he means write it on a post-it note and stick it to his blackberry . 
10437	2	a	you didn't set up your blackberry , dwight ? 
10438	1	a	yes , i did , but i do not intend to use it . it is pointless technology . 
10439	2	a	as opposed to . . . 
10440	1	a	printing press . tractor . mechanical thresher . telephone . airplane . the only inventions that matter . 
10441	2	a	what about cars ? 
10442	1	a	they fall under the category of airplanes . 
10443	2	a	they do ? so , cars are flightless airplanes . 
10444	1	a	correct . 
10445	2	a	got it . they're like the penguins of the airplane family . 
10446	1	a	that's an excellent analogy . 
10447	2	a	thanks . 
10448	4	a	hey , dwight , what about vaccines ? 
10449	1	a	 vaccines are for chumps ! 
10450	1	a	my mom didn't believe in vaccines . i got my smallpox the old-fashioned way . and i survived . so . . . joke's on you hospitals . 
10451	4	a	i saw it . i saw it , and it was amazing ! who said i didn't see it ? did jim say that i didn't see it ? i saw it !

10472	3	a	and . . . today the dunder-mifflin infinity website officially launches . 
10473	3	a	the company is projecting record high sales , and that by 6:00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company . wow ! watch out dwight . 
10474	1	a	that's ridiculous . i'm not going to be beaten by a website .

10480	1	a	you believe a computer can beat me ? 
10481	1	a	well i will prove you wrong . 
10482	1	a	we'll see .

10492	0	a	thank you . 
10493	1	a	i just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when i make a sale . 
10494	0	a	yes like a chime or a bell . . . 
10495	2	a	or a gong . 
10496	1	a	go to my car . open the trunk . inside you will see many pelts . under the smallest one is a case . inside that case is a bear horn . bring it to me .

10675	3	a	it is your problem . that's no way to do business , okay ? i ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon , so i would like eight pizzas for half-off . end of story .

10728	4	a	you came up to my desk , and said , this might sound weird , and there's no reason for me to know this , but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired .

10736	0	a	so , angela is stubborn as a mule , she's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested . 
10737	0	a	but do i like her or not , because if i like her , then i can't back down .

10860	2	a	do you run the bed and breakfest ? 
10861	1	a	it is not a b and b . 
10862	1	a	agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest . it consists of tourists coming to a farm , showing them around , giving them a bed , giving them brekafest . 
10863	2	a	does the department of health know about this ? 
10864	1	a	i'm not telling you anything . permits are pending . dwight schrute , dunder mifflin . 
10865	4	a	hello , i'm looking for a room . 
10866	1	a	okay , this is a mis-use of company phones . 
10867	4	a	it says here you cater to the eldery . 
10868	1	a	where did you read that ? 
10869	4	a	trip advsior . 
10870	1	a	trip advisor is the life blood of the agrotourism industry . a couple of bad reviews there , you might as well close up shop . that's what took down the stalk inn . one of the cutest little asparagus farms you'll ever see . 
10871	1	a	how many in your party ? 
10872	4	a	two ? 
10873	1	a	we offer tours of the fields , and of the barn . uh , perhaps you'll be interested in , um , mose's table making demonstration ? 
10874	3	a	oh ! um , actually , i need the car . 
10875	3	a	use to have two cars , traded 'em in , now we're down to one . good economic sense . although the new car is a porsche . for her . 
10876	1	a	one cardigan , one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask . 
10877	1	a	you took that with you . 
10878	1	a	you are incorrect . i was recently scrubbing my room of memories , and i didn't see it there .

10891	3	a	you wouldn't understand . it's a secret . 
10892	2	a	i wouldn't understand or a secret ? 
10893	4	a	you wouldn't understand , jim . it's a secret . 
10894	2	a	i can't believe this place is real . i mean , i've heard about his beet farm for years , but wow . 
10895	4	a	the beets motel . 
10896	2	a	the beets motel ? that is , wow . 
10897	4	a	thank you . eh . the embassy beets . radishon ! 
10898	2	a	how are you doing this ? 
10899	4	a	i don't know ! 
10900	4	a	oh my gosh . 
10901	3	a	i just love sales . i love it to death . it's as simple as that . and i don't get to do it enough as a manager , so i took this second job . i count it as a hobby . some people have golf , or relaxing . 
10902	3	a	hey , i just got off the phone , and i was gonna make another call . 
10903	3	a	no , they're with me , so . . . this is nick figaro , manager to the stars ! 
10904	1	a	we have three rooms , each with a different theme . 
10905	4	a	what are the themes ? 
10906	1	a	american , irrigation , and night-time . 
10907	4	a	irrigation . 
10908	2	a	nice . 
10909	1	a	i'll put you down for irrigation . well then , do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions ? 
10910	2	a	yes . we will be requiring a bed time story . 
10911	1	a	no . 
10912	2	a	not even harry potter ? 
10913	1	a	no . jim , come on . 
10914	1	a	mose , bags ! now ! 
10915	1	a	here we are , the irrigation room ! a very special room . so i'll come get you before the table-making demonstration . and as of this morning , we are completely wireless here in schrute farms . but as soon as i find out where mose hid all the wires , we'll get that power back on . all righty . 
10916	3	a	these meetings are useless . 
10917	3	a	very inspirational . 
10918	3	a	or a trained seal . 
10919	2	a	hmmm , i'd say 1 in 6 . 
10920	4	a	what ? 
10921	2	a	oh , i thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight . 
10922	1	a	mose , what are you doing ? no mose ! put the--- put the manure down ! put it down ! do not throw it ! do not throw it ! ow ! 
10923	3	a	yes , is mr . hudson there ? 
10924	3	a	i'm just calling because you responded positively to the---
10925	3	a	 . . . stanley ? 
10926	3	a	 senor , are you happy with your---
10927	3	a	 have you--- have you considered satellite television ? 
10928	3	a	well your son sounds like he's really motivated . i think it's crazy the coach won't play him frankly . 
10929	3	a	you bet . 
10930	3	a	look , i know sales , and i had that sale , i just needed a few more minutes---
10931	3	a	it is not a waste of our time . 
10932	3	a	no . 
10933	3	a	vikram doesn't have my people skills . 
10934	3	a	well , i hope this conversation has helped . 
10935	1	a	 and harry saw the white hand raise its wand , and felt voldemort's surge of vicious anger . saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony . 'harry ? ' it was over quickly as it had come . harry stood shaking in the darkness , clutching the gate in the garden , his heart racing . 
10936	3	a	what did you get tonight ? 
10937	3	a	oh , that looks good . 
10938	3	a	i am going with the vanilla crisp this evening . 
10939	3	a	thank you . 
10940	3	a	really ? 
10941	3	a	wonder what i would've been back home ? 
10942	3	a	i know , but it's competitive here . what's a dollar worth in your land ? medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something . 
10943	3	a	i would've been chief of surgery . . . or a cowboy . 
10944	2	a	 wait , you're going up there ?

10978	3	a	why ? 
10979	3	a	no , i had a really rough night , and my boss can back you up on that . 
10980	3	a	my other boss , mr . figaro . 
10981	3	a	what i do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business' . 
10982	2	a	are you a cocktail waitress ?

10993	3	a	well it sounds right , but is it ? 
10994	4	a	how did he use it again ? 
10995	3	a	thank you . 
10996	3	a	no one , uh , asked you anything ever , so whomever's name is toby , why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull . 
10997	3	a	i've never done this before . i've never quit anything in my life . so , you are filming history . 
10998	3	a	nick , i had a dream last night that i had two full time jobs . one here at the lipophedrazone diet pill company---

11000	3	a	in this dream i did both of these jobs beautifully , and i loved it , and everybody loved me . but the truth is , i can't do this .

11014	0	a	okay , well i come from a line wasps so long it leads back to moses . 
11015	4	a	okay , well she takes her convictions pretty seriously , she can be kind of severe . 
11016	0	a	yeah , and i punched a hole in a wall . 
11017	4	a	that's right , you did . 
11018	0	a	yeah . 
11019	4	a	now that i think about it , angela and andy might actually make a good couple . but i couldn't do that to dwight . . . or angela . . . or andy . 
11020	3	a	hey kevin , you're a gambler right ? a rounder , you play the ponies , small horses .

11031	4	a	doesn't jan have money ? 
11032	3	a	i don't talk to my girlfriend about money . it is rude , and unsexual . 
11033	3	a	i totally agree with you . but i don't have money problems , i don't . alright , you know what ? watch this , if i had money problems , would i do this ? 
11034	3	a	yeah , but i destroyed it , it's not even useable anymore . 
11035	3	a	no you didn't . 
11036	3	a	how would that help creed ? in monopoly when you go bankrupt , you lose . 
11037	3	a	that is a good point . 
11038	3	a	like the witness protection program . 
11039	3	a	i've always wanted to be in the witness protection program . fresh start , no debts , no baggage . i've already got my name picked out , lord rupert everton . i'm a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs . that's the life . 
11040	3	a	i . . . declare . . . bankruptcy ! 
11041	3	a	i didn't say it , i declared it . 
11042	3	a	yeah , tell me about it . 
11043	3	a	you know , jan has my credit cards , and she's using them as if i'm made of money , she thinks i'm a human atm machine . 
11044	3	a	oh , that's the muppet show , on dvd , classic . 
11045	0	a	i left a little present for angela . i think she's going to like it , because i found it outside of vance refrigeration all alone , and i told her in the note that the cat came to find her , that they were destined to be together . i got game . 
11046	3	a	mm-hm . that is so cool how you have my name at the top . 
11047	3	a	right .

11049	4	a	man , angela really had a hold on him . angela . 
11050	3	a	no , no , we are going to leave jan out of this . 
11051	3	a	we will find another way , we'll ask power-point . 
11052	3	a	you're a presentation tool if you think i'm gonna tell jan about this . 
11053	3	a	no you're not ! ok , just . . . you're not a tool . look , we'll tell her that it's bad , but it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work i was able to cut it in half . 
11054	3	a	she poses . 
11055	2	a	dwight , how's the hotel business ? 
11056	1	a	stupid .

11062	2	a	the dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings . 
11063	4	a	table making never seemed so possible .

11167	3	a	dancing babies ! i love it ! i love it ! 
11168	3	a	we are making a commercial for dunder mifflin today . our first ad ever . corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about dunder mifflin infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so . . . it's uh , not too shabby . 
11169	0	a	best ad ever . gimme a break , gimme a break , break me off a piece of that . . . i am totally blanking . what is the thing ? 
11170	2	a	nobody tell him ! 
11171	0	a	what ? no , why ? 
11172	2	a	you got it , you're so close ! 
11173	0	a	 break me off a piece of that . . . huh huh huh . . . br- applesauce . 
11174	2	a	break me off a piece of that applesauce , i don't think . . . 
11175	0	a	break me off a piece of that chrysler car . 
11176	2	a	nope . 
11177	0	a	football cream . grr ! 
11178	3	a	okay , it's football cream . it's football cream . alright ! so , anybody else ? 
11179	4	a	i'm taking a computer animation class so i could try to do a logo . 
11180	3	a	look at that . even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity . very good , very good . 
11181	3	a	hello hello ! 
11182	3	a	michael scott . 
11183	3	a	regional manager . 
11184	3	a	excited to talk ideas . 
11185	3	a	you know , i want this to be cutting edge . i want it to be fast , quick cuts , you know , youthful , sort of a mtv on crack kind of thing . 
11186	3	a	all right , good , well this is what we have to work with . 
11187	3	a	i would like you to meet andrew bernard . the 'nard dog . who let the 'nard dog out ? 
11188	0	a	hoo hoo hoo-hoo ! 
11189	3	a	he gives the best back rubs in the office . 
11190	0	a	it's true , i give a mean backrub . i also do good aromatherapy . not ! you just got 'nard dogged ! 
11191	3	a	now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe . 
11192	3	a	stanley is hilarious . phyllis is like our mrs . butterworth . kind of a less urban aunt jemima . 
11193	3	a	these are our accountants . and as you can see they are very different sizes . what you might want to do is kind of a papa bear , mama bear , baby bear thing . that might be kind of fun . 
11194	3	a	who else ? 
11195	2	a	i think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us . i mean , when i tell people that i work at dunder mifflin , they think that we sell mufflers , or muffins , or mittens , or . . . and frankly all of those sound better than paper , so i let it slide . 
11196	2	a	you playing that game again ? 
11197	1	a	second life is not a game . it is a multi-user virtual environment . it doesn't have points or scores , it doesn't have winners or losers . 
11198	2	a	oh it has losers . 
11199	1	a	i signed up for second life about a year ago . back then my life was so great that i literally wanted a second one . in my second life i was also a paper salesman and i was also named dwight . absolutely everything was the same . except i could fly . 
11200	3	a	actually i don't get paid by the hour anymore , but thank you , i get paid by the year , so . . . 
11201	3	a	yeah , i know . 
11202	3	a	mmm . okay . 
11203	3	a	that's what nassau came up with ? that sucks ! whoa . 
11204	3	a	well we can do better than that . 
11205	3	a	the waving ? 
11206	1	a	we cannot talk about this . . . because , someone might hear us . 
11207	0	a	we'll use code names . 
11208	1	a	angela can stay the same , but we'll change andy to dwight . 
11209	0	a	that's not different enough . 
11210	1	a	dwike ? 
11211	3	a	 shrek ! shrek , i'm a donkey ! i'm a donkey , shrek ! i'm just kidding . it's me . hello ry . 
11212	3	a	okay , calm down . i have a small problem . 
11213	3	a	yeah , well when i call about big problems you don't like that either , so make up you mind , kiddo . here is the deal , the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box , and sort of ignoring my ideas . 
11214	3	a	i'm creative , ryan . 
11215	3	a	well actually i can't cook , and i am starting a restaurant . mike's cereal shack . i'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store . 
11216	3	a	yeah ! 
11217	3	a	are you ? i don't think you're doing such a good job here , suppressing ideas and creativity . 
11218	3	a	hey guys , um , you know what , we cannot shoot this ad today . 
11219	3	a	how about never hundred hours , sir . 
11220	3	a	hey thanks . thank you . 
11221	3	a	yeah , i'm glad you called . ryan is being a little bitch again . 
11222	3	a	i'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it . 
11223	3	a	okay . and thus , michael scott sealed his own destiny . in a good way . 
11224	3	a	has anyone ever come up to you and said , 'you're not creative' ? 
11225	1	a	yes . 
11226	3	a	well they're wrong . you are creative . you are damn creative . each and every one of you . you are so much more creative than all of the other dry , boring morons that you work with . 
11227	2	a	who are you talking to , specifically ? 
11228	3	a	we have three scenes to film , big scenes . we have a song to write . so let's get cracking . kelly , i want you to do makeup . oscar , i would like you to do costume design , obviously . phyllis , i'd like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area . 
11229	3	a	okay , okay , phyllis this is what i want you to do . i want you to go down to the mall . i want you to get in line . i want you to get her to be in this commercial . this would be a huge coupe people . all right ? do not take no for an answer . 
11230	0	a	does anyone actually know what sue grafton looks like ? i mean , is she hot or- ? 
11231	0	a	well then maybe we should just use angela and say she's sue grafton . would anyone notice ? 
11232	3	a	line it up phyllis . 
11233	3	a	time out , time out , time out , time out , time out . i thought . . . i was under the impression that this was going to be a rap . 
11234	3	a	okay , darryl , wow , you need to learn a lot about your own culture . i'll make you a mix . 
11235	0	a	news flash . i got some juicy updates on operation fallen angel . remind me to tell you later .

11238	4	a	are you serious ? 
11239	2	a	yeah . 
11240	4	a	oh my god , he's really in pain . 
11241	4	a	who's that ? 
11242	2	a	oh , it's just my avatar guy . whatever . 
11243	4	a	he looks a lot like you . how much time did you spend on that ? 
11244	2	a	not much , it's just for tracking dwight so---
11245	4	a	right . . . you're a sports writer in philadelphia ? nice build too . 
11246	2	a	yep . 
11247	4	a	you have a guitar slung on your back . i did not know you played guitar .

11253	3	a	no , i hate it ! i hate it ! . . . i don't hate it , i just don't like it at all . and it's terrible . 
11254	3	a	okay , you know what . hold on , hold on darryl . 
11255	3	a	no . i said i hate the , the style . 
11256	0	a	 break me off a piece of that lumber tar . snickers bar . 
11257	3	a	okay , wow . wow , this looks uh , terrible . 
11258	0	a	break me off a piece of that grey poupon . 
11259	3	a	andy , andy , this is a pivotal scene in the ad . and if we don't get this , if we don't nail it , we're going to lose the whole triumph of the moment . the triumph of the will . now , god , what ? what phyllis ? 
11260	3	a	that'a girl . 
11261	3	a	did you , or did you not get sue grafton ? 
11262	3	a	ugh , can somebody give her a tissue please ? 
11263	2	a	i hope you're not killing yourself on this , because i'm sure it's good enough for michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one . 
11264	4	a	maybe , but it's not good enough for me yet . 
11265	2	a	okay . do you want me to stay ? 
11266	4	a	no no , you can go home . i'm good .

11273	4	a	i worked until about 2:45 am . and then i had to decide if i wanted to spend the night with michael editing in his office , and dwight watching michael edit in his office , or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck . i passed out on my keyboard trying to decide . 
11274	0	a	let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night .

11311	3	a	that's , that's a pirate movie . that's annoyed . well , he doesn't do very well under pressure . 
11312	3	a	and anybody else , we can just hire an actor to replace . follow me ! let's get this movin' . 
11313	3	a	all right , let's start . 
11314	2	a	all right ! i'm not sure what i'm supposed to be doing , but . . . 
11315	3	a	you are my producer , you are a suit . i am the creative genius . you take care of all the boring stuff , and let my mind just run free . 
11316	2	a	yup . 
11317	3	a	now , we have eighty-five dollars , and a sam goody gift certificate . . . 
11318	2	a	right . 
11319	3	a	 . . . and we need to be done by 9 a . m . tomorrow . 
11320	2	a	mmmhmm . why don't you start by telling me what you got . 
11321	3	a	we start on a single blank sheet of paper . 
11322	2	a	love it . 
11323	3	a	and we widen to reveal ancient rome . 
11324	2	a	mm , can't do that . 
11325	3	a	okay , we widen to reveal a spaceship blasting out of a woman's womb . 
11326	2	a	definitely can't do that . 
11327	3	a	bull man ! 
11328	2	a	you know what ? 
11329	3	a	this is bull ! 
11330	2	a	okay , scott , why don't you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet earth so we can make a commercial . 
11331	3	a	ahhhh ! 
11332	2	a	i'm just doing my job , man . 
11333	3	a	if you don't let me pursue my artistic vision , i am going to walk ! 
11334	2	a	good ! fine ! i've got one andy bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee . . . 
11335	3	a	no ! no ! jim , jim , don't , don't . . . 
11336	2	a	what ? what ? 
11337	3	a	no , i can do it . 
11338	2	a	what ? 
11339	3	a	i can do it good . i can do it good . please , don't . please . please give me it . 
11340	2	a	okay , make a commercial . 
11341	3	a	 do you want this open or closed ? 
11342	2	a	closed . 
11343	3	a	hey , everybody , i just got off the phone with david wallace , and he has given us the go-ahead to make the first ever dunder mifflin television commercial . huh ? 
11344	3	a	i can't hear you ! heard you a little bit less that time . must be . . . 
11345	1	a	we had already applauded . 
11346	3	a	okay , okay . who could do music ? 
11347	4	a	how about darryl ? 
11348	3	a	actually , i'm a little concerned about having a black person do the music , because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a . . . celestine prophesy , and keep the next bon jovi from ever picking up a piano . 
11349	2	a	michael is on a mission to prove that he's creative . which i think is odd , because michael actually might be the most creative person i've ever known . every day , michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before . 
11350	3	a	this is perfect . 
11351	1	a	he looks like your twin . 
11352	3	a	this is a dummy , a la ferris bueller's day off . we have tied a string to the wrist , which goes to the door . when somebody opens the door , the hand goes down , hits the remote , turns on the tape recorder , which is me snoring . now nobody knows whether i am here , or whether i am gone . 
11353	1	a	i will know . 
11354	3	a	but , you will not tell anyone . 
11355	1	a	i won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky . yeah . 
11356	3	a	just go out , and come back in . 
11357	3	a	what ? 
11358	3	a	hey everyone , can i have your attention please ? i just thought you all should know that stanley hudson is planning on leaving us , because our old friend karen from utica is going to give him more money to work there . 
11359	3	a	no , no , no , no , no-no , no no . you completely misinterpreted my tone , this is a horrible thing . clearly , karen is trying to get back at us because jim dumped her . 
11360	2	a	oh , i don't think that is what's happening . 
11361	3	a	okay , smarty pants , then why ? why is she trying to take stanley from us ? 
11362	3	a	that could not possibly be it . 
11363	3	a	how can i get you to stay ? 
11364	3	a	yeah we all want money . but there is none in the budget , so . . . tell me why you're really leaving . 
11365	3	a	mo money mo problems , stanley . you of all people should know that . let me ask you this , if i were-
11366	3	a	pssh , kay . 
11367	4	a	oscar , did you bring it ? 
11368	4	a	okay , well i have the tablecloth , don't forget the flatware . 
11369	4	a	oscar , toby , and i are founding members of the finer things club . we meet once a month to discuss books and art , celebrate culture in a very civilized way . sometimes the debate can get heated , but we're always respectful . there is no paper , no plastic , and no work talk allowed . it's very exclusive . 
11370	2	a	so tell me again why i can't be part of your club ? 
11371	4	a	because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny . 
11372	2	a	oscar ? 
11373	4	a	some people . 
11374	3	a	fillipellers , how's it hanging ? 
11375	3	a	to the left ? 
11376	3	a	to the right ? 
11377	3	a	okay , enough small talk , go ahead . 
11378	3	a	yes , listen , um . . . you cannot tear stanley from his family like this . 
11379	3	a	no , his work family . look , this is very hard for me , but i'm going to give you my best man . you may have toby . 
11380	3	a	you can train him . he's very very smart , and funny , and charming . . . you know , i can't do it , toby is the worst . that- that was a bluff , um . . . listen , if you are going to poach one of my guys , i'm going to poach one of yours . 
11381	3	a	okay , good-bye . wait ! wait ! karen , could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please ? your best one ? 
11382	4	a	i have ben nugent on the line , he is the top salesman in utica . 
11383	3	a	hi ben , michael scott . 
11384	3	a	i'm going to cut right to the chase here . do you like magic ? because i'm a genie in a bottle , and i'm going to grant you three wishes . to move to scranton , to have a great job , and to be my best friend . 
11385	3	a	 get out . uh , yeah . i also saved her life , but i guess that's not as grabby . 
11386	3	a	no , i fired them , and your next . . . . so what do you say ? 
11387	3	a	what is that guy talking about ? scranton is not lame . scranton is the cool , fun branch . we're like animal house . 
11388	1	a	found him ! 
11389	3	a	jim , we're getting crapped on . word is that our branch sucks , and we have to do something about it . 
11390	2	a	so what are you going to do ? 
11391	3	a	what are we going to do ? we are going to make a monster sale , that's what we're going to do . corcroan dropped staples . 
11392	2	a	did they ? 
11393	3	a	yes they did , oh yes they did , and we are going to murder it . you , me , dwight are going to jump into my pt cruiser , and we're going to crush this sale . we're going to prove , what the hell is that music ? 
11394	4	a	it's vivaldi , for finer things . 
11395	3	a	that's the problem , that's the problem . we need rock n' roll pam , rock n' roll . alright ? oh . . . my . . . god , that's why people are leaving . i- i have no words . 
11396	2	a	we just passed the exit for corcroan . 
11397	3	a	what ? what ? we did ? 
11398	3	a	look at his face ! look at his face ! 
11399	2	a	what are we doing ?

11403	3	a	we are going on a panty raid to utica , is what we're doing . 
11404	2	a	we're going to utica ? 
11405	3	a	uh-huh . 
11406	2	a	i'm not going to utica right now . 
11407	3	a	yes you are . oh , buckle up jim . 
11408	2	a	no . 
11409	3	a	we are going to make karen wish that she had never been dumped by you . 
11410	3	a	in your face
11411	1	a	yow ! 
11412	2	a	i can't believe you guys . i'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend . 
11413	3	a	are you calling karen ? 
11414	2	a	no , i'm not calling karen . 
11415	1	a	he's lying . 
11416	3	a	yep , get it . 
11417	2	a	what are you doing ? stop it , dwight ! 
11418	1	a	 gah-ah-hah-ha ! 
11419	2	a	are you kidding me ? 
11420	1	a	no communication with the outside world jim . 
11421	3	a	it had to be done , it had to be done . 
11422	2	a	well , that kind of sucks , because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it , so . . .

11434	1	a	yeah , come on , it will be so badass .

11440	2	a	are you kidding me ? we've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time ? 
11441	3	a	teach her to offer stanley more money . 
11442	2	a	so the deal was , dwight doesn't blow anything up , and i wear a costume . and a moustache . 
11443	3	a	so , why did you and karen break up ? was it the sex ? 
11444	2	a	what ? 
11445	3	a	i can't imagine the sex being bad , i mean her body is . . . 
11446	2	a	okay , you know what ? 
11447	3	a	 . . . awesome . 
11448	2	a	why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about ?

11453	3	a	ah , la , la , la . what is that ? that sound . . . the air-conditioning leaking or something ? 
11454	2	a	that doesn't make sense , couldn't be . 
11455	3	a	what is that ? dwight , are you peeing ? 
11456	1	a	i'm peeing in this empty can . 
11457	2	a	oh my god !

11466	1	a	i think i cut my penis on the lid ! 
11467	4	a	and spend time with george emerson . that's what i would do . i mean it's the best male protagonist we've read , right ? 
11468	0	a	 totally , i mean , come on , such a free spirit . 
11469	0	a	just came to discuss my favorite e . m . forester novel . pam , these finger sandwiches look finger-lickin' delicious pam . 
11470	4	a	uh , i'm sorry andy , but this is a closed club . 
11471	0	a	the finer things club is the most exclusive club in this office . naturally , it's where i need to be . the party planning committee is my back up , and kevin's band is my safety . 
11472	0	a	fine . i'll just sit here , in the common area , and read my book . which just happens to be the very same book you're reading . 
11473	0	a	why can't i be in the club ? 
11474	2	a	i can't believe we're here , i can't believe this is happening . 
11475	1	a	believe it . 
11476	3	a	afro wig , do you want the afro wig ? 
11477	2	a	no , michael . i'm not leaving the car . 
11478	3	a	yeah , dwight , here's how it's going to go down . you and i-
11479	2	a	guy's going by . shh . 
11480	3	a	you and i are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers . and then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place . 
11481	1	a	and if we have to defend ourselves , i will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk . 
11482	2	a	no , no , you won't do that . nope . 
11483	1	a	then i'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes . 
11484	2	a	dwight , nothing with the eyes , please ? 
11485	1	a	okay , jim . 
11486	2	a	oh my god , that's her ! that's her , go , go , go . 
11487	1	a	let's move ! move , move , move , move ! 
11488	2	a	shut up , you , shut up ! this is the dumbest thing we've ever done . 
11489	4	a	i think it's interesting how forster uses italy to represent sexuality and passion . and that also brought up themes of , uh , you know , fate and coincidence . and lucy's torn between these two things . she's torn between passion and convention . 
11490	4	a	it just- to be making a case for passion in edwardian times , i thought was , uh . . . 
11491	4	a	maybe sort of ahead of his time as a writer . 
11492	4	a	very brave choice also , i thought . 
11493	4	a	why don't you use the microwave in the kitchen , phyllis ? 
11494	0	a	so , stanley , are you really outta here ? 
11495	0	a	i'm gonna miss you man , you've been like an uncle to me . like a kind old uncle remus . i wanna stay in touch . 
11496	3	a	 we are in a stairwell . 
11497	1	a	 we are climbing some stairs . 
11498	1	a	i'm breathing heavily . 
11499	2	a	okay , you know what ? you don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me . 
11500	1	a	well . . . 
11501	3	a	there's a guy , there's a guy . 
11502	1	a	there's a security guard coming by . hello , we're warehouse workers . would you like more proof ? 
11503	3	a	oh my god , oh my god , that was very close . 
11504	1	a	i can see the security guard's eyes . 
11505	2	a	no , no , don't do anything to them . 
11506	1	a	i have to do something to his eyes . 
11507	1	a	the eyes are the groin of the head . 
11508	2	a	alright , great scott , if you found that choking hazard poster , just head on home . 
11509	3	a	we found something far better , their crown jewel . their industrial copier . 
11510	2	a	isn't that thing huge ? 
11511	3	a	it's enormous , but it's got wheels . we're wheeling it down the hall , into the stairwell . get the car ready , keep the engine running . 
11512	2	a	no , that is a terrible idea , don't do this . 
11513	3	a	aha ! 
11514	1	a	my hip bone ! 
11515	3	a	we're wedged between the copier and the railing . ah ! ow ! ow , my leg ! jim leave us . 
11516	1	a	don't leave us ! 
11517	3	a	save yourself ! 
11518	1	a	don't leave us , help us , we need help jim ! 
11519	2	a	okay ! first of all , stop using my name . and second of all-
11520	3	a	dwight , you gotta move ! 
11521	2	a	damn it guys ! 
11522	3	a	dwight , could you move over a little bit . 
11523	1	a	i'm losing control of my bladder . 
11524	2	a	oh my god , oh my god , karen is back ! 
11525	1	a	did you say karen ? 
11526	3	a	take her to a motel , make love to her jim . 
11527	2	a	no , i'm not doing that . 
11528	3	a	just say you wanna get back together . 
11529	2	a	no , i'm not doing that ! 
11530	3	a	it doesn't have to mean anything . just , do it for stanley . come on jim , just climb on top of her and think about stanley . ah , jim , if this is it for me , promise me something , host the dundies . 
11531	2	a	hey karen . 
11532	2	a	first of all , hi . 
11533	2	a	you good ? i'm just checking on the other branches . michael wants me to do that from time to time , so . . . 
11534	1	a	do not tell karen about the industrial copier . 
11535	2	a	copy that . 
11536	1	a	listen lady , you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people . 
11537	1	a	then we will burn utica to the ground . 
11538	3	a	 dwight . granted , maybe this was not the best idea , but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them . and if you so much as harm a hair on stanley's head , we will burn utica to the ground . 
11539	2	a	yes ? 
11540	2	a	yeah , trying to quit though . 
11541	2	a	oh no , i didn't want to see you . not that i'm not happy seeing you , right now , i'm just saying ultimately i was here for the copier . equal , i'd say it was equal . so , good to see you . . . 
11542	2	a	i mean , it's just that- you know , pam and i are still dating , so , and , i just mean that things are going really well , so i didn't want to see . . . you . . .

11585	4	a	i'm kidding around . we joke about that stuff all the time . i'm not really the jealous type , so , i don't care if jim sees karen . i care a little . 
11586	1	a	 scranton rules ! 
11587	3	a	dwight ! stop it ! can you help me please , i'm being crushed . 
11588	3	a	would it have killed you to spend the afternoon making love to her in a motel room ? like i begged you to ? pam would have understood . heck , pam would have done it . 
11589	1	a	pam is down for anything . 
11590	2	a	you embarrassed me . 
11591	3	a	you embarrassed us . 
11592	1	a	yeah . we shoulda brought andy . i cut a chunk out of my penis for nothing . 
11593	3	a	morning . 
11594	4	a	ryan invited some of the branch managers and toby into the woods for a 'get to know you' weekend . michael wasn't invited . apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him . 
11595	4	a	did you sleep in cabins ? 
11596	4	a	who went ? 
11597	3	a	 hey , nobody cares . nobody cares . i need that room at some point , so just , wrap it up . 
11598	3	a	hypothetically , if i were to ask you to go camping , and you know what hypothetical means ? not real . 
11599	2	a	got it . 
11600	3	a	so if i were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me , would you go ? 
11601	2	a	absolutely , yes . 
11602	2	a	when michael plays the hypothetical game , i always say yes . 
11603	3	a	really ? 
11604	2	a	yeah ? 
11605	3	a	oh , you wanna go today ? 
11606	2	a	and i am always busy . 
11607	2	a	oh , can't go today , 'cause i'm donating blood . 
11608	3	a	how often can you actually donate blood ? 
11609	2	a	is there a limit ? 
11610	3	a	your body only has a certain amount . 
11611	2	a	well , is that it ? or ? 
11612	3	a	yeah , just this whole toby , camping thing , uh , seems a little lame . 
11613	2	a	how so ? 
11614	3	a	a bunch of guys , in a tent ? making s'mores ? 
11615	2	a	what's that ? 
11616	3	a	hello , i'm broken mountain . you know , here's the thing . that's not how you go camping . i think you go camping by yourself---
11617	2	a	right . 
11618	3	a	in the wilderness . it's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents . it's one guy , or two guys , if your plans change . 
11619	2	a	not gonna change . 
11620	3	a	i wanna do it myself . you know , i want to go and , and find out something about myself , i wanna get outta here . all the cliques , and the office politics . fluorescent lights . asbestos . 
11621	2	a	i thought we had that looked at . 
11622	3	a	i'm sick of it jim . i'm sick of this place . 
11623	3	a	when jan and i had satellite , we used to watch a reality show called 'survivorman . ' and , it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die , try not to get eaten by an animal , or be overexposed . 
11624	3	a	ok , i will only need two things . roll of duct tape and a knife . 
11625	1	a	 i'm on it . 
11626	3	a	ok . thirty minutes or less , please come back . save the receipts . hey , what . . . 
11627	1	a	let's see if any of these will work . 
11628	3	a	hey , hey hey ! dwight . . dwight . 
11629	1	a	i keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office . i saved jim's life with a can of pepper spray i had velcroed under my desk . people say , 'oh , it's dangerous to keep weapons in the home or the work place . ' well i say , 'it's better to be hurt by someone you know accidentally , than by a stranger on purpose . '
11630	3	a	dwight and i are going out . he will return later , but i will not . i will also be taking a personal day tomorrow , and perhaps the next day . 
11631	4	a	do you want me to ask where you're going ? 
11632	3	a	no . 
11633	4	a	great . 
11634	3	a	dwight will be driving me deep into the pennsylvania wilderness . 
11635	4	a	oh . 
11636	3	a	where he will then leave me to either die or to survive . the choice is yours . 
11637	2	a	hmm , no , the choice is actually yours . are you sure you want to do this ? 
11638	3	a	yes , and i am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days . do not try to follow me . 
11639	2	a	ok , great . 
11640	3	a	this is a very personal , private experience in the wild , that i wish to share it with me , myself and i . 
11641	2	a	yup . 
11642	3	a	when i return , i hope to be a completely changed human being . 
11643	2	a	that'd be great . 
11644	1	a	do i believe that michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment ? let's put it this way: no , i do not . 
11645	1	a	no , i would never leave you for dead . you would never escape . 
11646	3	a	well , yes i would . and i would survive . 
11647	1	a	i would make sure that you were dead . 
11648	3	a	well . . . 
11649	1	a	first , i would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified . 
11650	3	a	you . . . 
11651	1	a	and they would call me the overkill killer . 
11652	3	a	you . . . you are as creepy as a real serial killer . for real . ok . 
11653	1	a	what are you doing ? 
11654	3	a	i am putting this on so i have no familiarity with my surroundings . now this way , i can't retrace my steps . i don't know what streets we've been--- ow ! what are you doing ? 
11655	1	a	it would be better if you were unconscious . 
11656	3	a	no ! gosh ! dwight . stop it , stop it ! stop it . 
11657	1	a	do you want to do this right or not ? 
11658	3	a	just , please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life ? 
11659	2	a	oh , wasn't it just someone's birthday ? 
11660	2	a	i do remember , yeah . 
11661	2	a	you know what , i have an idea . why don't we just do one big shared party ? 
11662	2	a	there are thirteen people working in this office , so thirteen times a year michael gets a cake and balloons , and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast . there are two types of toasts . one is a joke about how old you are . 
11663	3	a	 look at those wrinkles . blacks do crack ! not crack the drug . 
11664	2	a	and the other is something inappropriate . or horrible . or both . what else ? he only sings the high harmony to 'happy birthday . ' and he's a very big believer in surprise parties . maybe even , arguably , possibly to a fault . 
11665	3	a	 happy birthday ! 
11666	3	a	 happy birthday ! 
11667	3	a	 happy birthday ! 
11668	2	a	so . . . i think , yeah , i think getting these out of the way might be productive . 
11669	2	a	we can just have one big fun party . everybody's happy , nobody wastes their time . 
11670	4	a	wow ! you're shaking things up a bit , huh ? 
11671	2	a	it's a pretty good idea , don't you think ? 
11672	4	a	do you think it's a good idea ? 
11673	2	a	no . . . i think it's a great idea . 
11674	4	a	 hmm . 
11675	1	a	we're here . 
11676	3	a	dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest . just the two of us from this point out . 
11677	1	a	 here we go . just the two of us 
11678	1	a	here we go , into the wild . mighty forest . can you smell the trees and the nature ? 
11679	1	a	keep going , you're fine . just some bushes and some thickets keep going . you wanted wilderness , you got it . 
11680	2	a	you know , try sending them another invoice . 
11681	2	a	alright . oh , did you see my memo by the way ? 
11682	2	a	right ? i was just thinking . . . 
11683	2	a	right ! exactly . knew i could count on you . 
11684	1	a	good a spot as any . 
11685	3	a	what are you doing ? stop . dwight , dwight . just --
11686	1	a	i'm just --

11691	3	a	alright , very good . ahh , ok . 
11692	1	a	good luck , michael . 
11693	3	a	thanks for the ride . ok . leave me be , dwight . 
11694	2	a	what's that ? 
11695	2	a	oh , sure . 
11696	2	a	ok . 
11697	4	a	wow ! that was easy . 
11698	2	a	yeah , people like me i guess . 
11699	2	a	well i think meredith was just --
11700	2	a	everybody's birthday .

11702	2	a	you want a birthday pie ? 
11703	2	a	well , i'm gonna to talk to angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie . 
11704	2	a	it will be angela . 
11705	1	a	i lied to michael . i said that i would leave him alone , but i will not . i will remain close by to provide unseen moral support , but i will never help him . i will let harm befall him . i will even let him die . but i will never let him lose his dignity . 
11706	3	a	there we go . much better . now everything i brought with me can be used . my sport coat here , can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts . 
11707	3	a	i'm going to wear what was once one of my pant legs . 
11708	3	a	see , this is a beautiful piece of material this could be used for all sorts of things . 
11709	3	a	some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable .

11715	2	a	alright , i'll look into it , but the answer's no . 
11716	0	a	wow , ok , harsh . just don't expect me to show up . 
11717	2	a	hey , andy , i have some calls to make .

11724	1	a	michael is a man of great depth and passion . i don't know what he's searching for out here . i hope he finds it . lunch . 
11725	3	a	well it is a little chillier than i had thought , so i have fashioned my hat back into my pants . several hours in , time for me to find some nourishment . now , these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life . things like , uh , squirrels , nice juicy rabbit would be delicious . 
11726	1	a	about two more minutes . 
11727	2	a	hey guys , what're we talking about ? 
11728	3	a	well if you take a look at this , i tented my pants . i've made myself a nice pants tent shelter . and this little guy may be dunder mifflin paper some day .

11749	2	a	sure glad you're back . 
11750	3	a	you are relieved . 
11751	2	a	you have no idea . 
11752	3	a	so what did i miss ? 
11753	2	a	well , i tried to put all the birthdays together at once . 
11754	3	a	oh . 
11755	2	a	so , terrible idea . 
11756	3	a	yeah , okay , i did that . rookie mistake . 
11757	2	a	you did do it ? 
11758	3	a	uh huh . yeah , just wait . ten years , you'll figure it out . 
11759	2	a	well , i don't think i'll be here in ten years . 
11760	3	a	that's what i said . that's what she said . 
11761	2	a	that's what who said ? 
11762	3	a	i never know . i just say it . i say stuff like that , you know , to lighten the tension . when things sort of get hard . 
11763	2	a	that's what she said . 
11764	3	a	hey ! nice . really good . bravo , my young ward . 
11765	3	a	come in ! 
11766	4	a	oh , it's creed's birthday today . should we get him an ice-cream cake ? mint chocolate chip ? 
11767	3	a	pam , are you my friend ? 
11768	4	a	oh , no . 
11769	3	a	we have been friends forever , right ? 
11770	4	a	yes , i have been working with you forever . 
11771	3	a	hypothetically . . . would you go camping with me , if i were to ask you ? and bear in mind that i would never actually ask you to go camping . that jim is also a friend of mine , and i would rather die than make any sort of improper ovation toward you . 
11772	4	a	i don't think so . 
11773	4	a	here's the thing . when michael invents a hypothetical situation , he eventually turns it into an actual situation . 
11774	3	a	do you understand that jim is like a brother to me , and i would never do anything inappropriate ? 
11775	4	a	i do . 
11776	3	a	so , as friends , would you go with me on a camping trip ? 
11777	4	a	no . 
11778	3	a	thank you for your honesty . 
11779	4	a	you're welcome . open or closed ? 
11780	3	a	split the difference . hey . . . mint chocolate chip , please ? is jim out there ? 
11781	4	a	no . 
11782	3	a	can you send dwight in here ? 
11783	4	a	yeah . dwight , michael wants to see you in his office . 
11784	1	a	you wanted to see me ? 
11785	3	a	mmhmm . i had something very personal i would like to discuss . would you go find jim , and send him in here , please ? 
11786	1	a	i'm on it . 
11787	4	a	michael has employed dwight to track you down . 
11788	2	a	how much time do i have ? 
11789	1	a	jim , michael's office . 
11790	4	a	couple minutes , give or take . 
11791	1	a	now , jim ! 
11792	1	a	and this . . . is a hassenfass . case-hardened steel . one side , as sharp as you'd ever want something to be . the other side serrated for maximum damage . 
11793	3	a	okay . 
11794	1	a	look at that . perfectly balanced . this is a fine precision instrument . 
11795	3	a	all right , dexter , just give me the knife . 
11796	1	a	don't you want a sheath for that ? 
11797	3	a	no , just get me a case . all right .

11804	1	a	mmmnnnnmmm . . . 
11805	3	a	 what is this called again ? 
11806	3	a	i'll call back . 
11807	4	a	every time michael's in a meeting , he makes me come in and give him a post-it note telling him who's on the phone . i did it once , and he freaked out . he loved it so much . the thing is he doesn't get that many calls . so he has me make them up every 10 minutes . 
11808	3	a	 yeah , um , tell him i'll call him back . 
11809	3	a	you can't always work 200 days though . 
11810	3	a	 oh , no , no , no , i don't have time for this . tell him i'm in a meeting . 
11811	3	a	yep . 
11812	3	a	oh . ah , this is a very important client . but , i have the most important client sitting right in front of me , my boss , so i will call him later . 
11813	3	a	n-no , money isn't everything ryan . and you're my friend , and i don't want to be rude . 
11814	3	a	i refuse . my house , my rules , i insist .

11851	3	a	okay . all right . 
11852	3	a	yessh . 
11853	3	a	well , it was not just termination . it was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior . 
11854	4	a	hey , kevin . jim needs to see you . 
11855	4	a	he needs help balancing some travel receipts . 
11856	4	a	yeah , no , he asked for you specifically . he's in the conference room .

11868	3	a	well , if it did , then the company is breaking its own rules . 
11869	3	a	because before we started dating , we disclosed our relationship to hr . and i have the proof right here . 
11870	3	a	i will allow it . 
11871	3	a	uh . . . 
11872	3	a	uh-huh . 
11873	3	a	ugh . well , de-depends on how you define 'begin' . i mean , if it was from the first time we shook hands , that's like six years ago . if it's from the first time we kissed , that's like two years ago . 
11874	3	a	if it was the first time we kissed sober , it was like four months after that . 
11875	3	a	line . 
11876	2	a	good game meredith . 
11877	1	a	all right ! what is going on here ? 
11878	2	a	dwight ! thank god you're here . as it turns out , one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master , and i have to play him tomorrow , or we lose the account . can you help me out ? will you help me practice ? 
11879	2	a	 what the hell ? 
11880	1	a	i told you . 
11881	1	a	all of my heroes are table tennis players . zoran primorac , jan-ove waldner , wang tao , j'rg ro'kopf , and of course ashraf helmi . i even have a life size poster of hugo hoyama on my wall . and the first time i left pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of andrzej grubba . 
11882	3	a	jan and i had an off again , on again relationship for two years . and i know this destroys her case , and i am sorry , but i throw myself at the mercy of the deposition . 
11883	3	a	whoa whoa whoa whoa ! what are you doing with my diary ? 
11884	3	a	irie . 
11885	3	a	i don't think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary . 
11886	3	a	 can i sit here ? 
11887	3	a	how can you give up my diary like that ? 
11888	3	a	how'd you even find it ? 
11889	3	a	i don't like lump . i'm really upset about this . 
11890	3	a	fine . i love you . 
11891	3	a	not a woman , just a cool , great looking , best friend . 
11892	3	a	alright , alright . this is the way i see it . yes , i had sex with jan , and yes , i did consider jan to be my girlfriend . however , jan clearly didn't consider me to be her boyfriend . so her actions are completely rightful . 
11893	3	a	thank you very much . you didn't have to say that . 
11894	3	a	that was before our relationship . she was going through a divorce , and she was drinking a lot . . . . . . of water . 
11895	3	a	march 17th . 
11896	3	a	yes . 
11897	3	a	 'i am out of carrots . i am out of sticks . mr . scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee , and a poor branch manager . i recommend he be removed from that position and re-assigned to sales where he belongs . '
11898	4	a	 how's it going ? 
11899	1	a	well , he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable . 
11900	2	a	check this out though , spin serve . well , it works like 80% of the time , so . . . 
11901	4	a	nice . so , should i reschedule the rematch with darryl now ? 
11902	2	a	i think i'm ready . 
11903	4	a	i'll make the call . 
11904	1	a	wait a minute , darryl is the client ? . . . no , no , no . he works here , dumbass . 
11905	2	a	 . . . right . spin-serve ! 
11906	3	a	how can you do that to me ? 
11907	3	a	dunder mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect , with loyalty . they were going to give me your job and i should have taken it . 
11908	3	a	see ? i was his number 1 contender . i was being groomed . 
11909	3	a	 . . . absolutely not . 
11910	4	a	 yes ! way to go . see that ? 
11911	4	a	you know what ? i'm sick of this ! let's go , you and me ! 
11912	4	a	let's go . pick up a paddle . 
11913	4	a	i am .

11918	3	a	 hey , david ? 
11919	3	a	i think you're a nice guy too . 
11920	3	a	why did i do it ? i don't know . jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary . but she already brought the diary with her to new york , so . . . you expect to get screwed by your company , but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend . 
11921	3	a	 what do you want to do for dinner ? 
11922	3	a	sure trying to save some money . . . get something cheap .

11964	2	a	michael has asked pam and me to dinner at least 9 times . and every time we've been able to get out of it . but i've got to give him credit , he got me . because i'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate . 
11965	1	a	michael , what time should i be arriving ? 
11966	3	a	dwight , it's couples only . and besides , i only have six wine glasses , so it will be me and jan , and pam and jim , and angela and andy .

12041	2	a	michael and jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning . so i'm going to make a run for it . 
12042	2	a	you'll never guess , i just got a message from my landlord apparently , my apartment flooded , something with a sprinkler . pam , we should probably get going and see the damage . 
12043	4	a	oh okay .

12092	0	a	yeah it does .

12135	4	a	 one night . . . 
12136	4	a	 food ! 
12137	0	a	i believe it means mouth pleaser . 
12138	0	a	it's french . i studied some french during my semester at sea . or , shall i say a semester at la mer , which is french for 'sea . '
12139	0	a	mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
12140	3	a	yes , i did , for you , princess . even though i only went number one . i didn't really wash my hands . ohhh , what have we here ? this looks delicious .

12143	0	a	mmm . 
12144	3	a	good stuff . all right . let's get down to some wine drinking . 
12145	4	a	oh , my god , i thought i was gonna pass out . 
12146	2	a	we should probably get back . 
12147	4	a	mmm-mm . i'm probably just gonna stay here for a while , say i got lost . 
12148	4	a	it was just a little . . . 
12149	2	a	i didn't have anything , jan . 
12150	2	a	i'm sorry . she scares me . 
12151	1	a	michael's dinner party is for couples only , which is why i wasn't initially invited . but that was then . i very recently entered into a serious , monogamous relationship . if that idiot ever gets here . 
12152	4	a	where did you grow up ? 
12153	3	a	it's been a rough couple of weeks . 
12154	3	a	little trouble . yes . well , jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift . 
12155	4	a	wow , you did neighborhood watch ? 
12156	3	a	yes . 
12157	3	a	so she's passed out , and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors' dog . . . 
12158	3	a	and the neighbors blamed jan . 
12159	3	a	it's like , you know , the dog shouldn't have been outside in the first place . anyway , it's a tragedy , really , because the paint is not gonna come off the dog until it sheds . . . 
12160	3	a	so . . . 
12161	3	a	well . 
12162	2	a	what's that ? 
12163	4	a	w . b . jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get . 
12164	2	a	so we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there . 
12165	4	a	which just means we get to see more of our lovely street . tell them what we saw today jim . 
12166	2	a	oh today , we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken . 
12167	4	a	nature . 
12168	0	a	i lost a penny out of my loafers , oscar . 
12169	4	a	some of us like the walk more than others . 
12170	4	a	 did you pick a new chair ? it's been awhile . 
12171	3	a	pam , when i first opened this catalog , i thought i was just going to be picking out a chair . 
12172	4	a	but instead , you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair . 
12173	4	a	michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago . and normally i wouldn't care , but he promised me his old one . it's way better . it's one of these . i really want it . 
12174	3	a	 have you ever seen this woman ? 
12175	4	a	her ? 
12176	3	a	hmm . . . 
12177	4	a	the one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair ? 
12178	3	a	look at her smile . those eyes , look at her eyes . she's got - i don't know what it is actually , she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch . 
12179	4	a	or in a great chair . 
12180	3	a	oh , yeah , maybe , but remember after my dinner party when i said that i was swearing off women ? 
12181	4	a	i definitely remember your dinner party . 
12182	3	a	i think what i meant was that i was completely swearing off one woman . jan . i think that fate put this catalog in my hands . 
12183	4	a	actually , i put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair . 
12184	3	a	what is it like being single ? i like it . i like starting each day with a sense of possibility . and i'm optimistic because every day i get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results . 
12185	3	a	ladies and gentleman , would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85 . 
12186	4	a	 no , he hasn't picked one yet . 
12187	3	a	i am ready to start dating again . getting back on the market . so , fyi , for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends , use the woman on page 85 as a template . that will be all . 
12188	0	a	i left my cell phone in my car . 
12189	3	a	 listen man , i am completely over jan , so , would you set me up ? 
12190	3	a	i thought that you were engaged ? 
12191	3	a	whaaaat ? god , that's terrible man . eghh , she's crazy . umm , are you still on good terms with any of her friends ? 
12192	3	a	oh . . . 
12193	3	a	yeah . . . ugh . she's . . . you don't deserve her . alright . 
12194	3	a	 oh hello oscar mayer weiner lover . i bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you'd never touch 'em , because of your condition . umm . . . 
12195	3	a	what ? 
12196	3	a	oh . 
12197	3	a	hmm , i see , feisty . so she's not jolly or sassy ? not like a jolly , sassy opera singer ? 
12198	3	a	oooo . catcher or in field ? 
12199	3	a	is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer ? could we share a row boat ? could , could a row boat support her ? 
12200	3	a	i think i'm being very clear what i'm asking . would an average size row boat support her without capsizing ? it bothers me that you're not answering the question . 
12201	3	a	damn it , i knew it ! i knew it phyllis ! ok ! 
12202	3	a	what is wrong with these people ? i would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry . 
12203	3	a	dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me , but it is and you know why ? because nobody here is willing to help me . nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request , would it ? well , fine . here goes . 
12204	1	a	 write legibly people . 
12205	0	a	because of the construction at w . b . jones , half of us have to park in the satellite lot . 
12206	3	a	hmm . . 
12207	0	a	it's like a ten minute walk . 
12208	3	a	well , look , i am in an assigned parking place in front , so . . . alright , alright , alright , umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one . ok , yes that would be bad . 
12209	0	a	yes . 
12210	3	a	that would be bad . 
12211	0	a	ok . 
12212	0	a	 . . . so help us out . 
12213	3	a	wish i could , but i can't . well can , but won't . should , maybe , but shorn't . 
12214	3	a	what part of shorn't don't you understand , kevin ? look i could probably handle it , yes , but i think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves . 
12215	0	a	we won't let you down . 
12216	3	a	oh you can't because i don't care . listen , don't forget to fill out those cards . my love cards . 
12217	4	a	 who are you putting down ? 
12218	2	a	oh , you don't know her .

12626	3	a	zing and pep , see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for . yes , jim ? 
12627	2	a	what about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep ? 
12628	3	a	now we're cooking . i like this . maybe a whole theme , like a rap . a rap rhyme . . . 
12629	2	a	an urban thing . . .

12639	3	a	well you don't get it , because stanley is a beautiful , sassy , powerful black man , and you're . . . you . if you had any friends , you would understand . friends joke with one another: 'hey um , you're poor . ' 'well hey , you're mama's dead . ' that's what friends do . it's . . . you're so white . 
12640	3	a	mmhmm . 
12641	3	a	okay , i will . . . i'm not feeling very well right now though . my stomach hurts , so i may be going home early today , but . . . 
12642	3	a	well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office , so it's probably psychological . 
12643	0	a	you meet a lot of ladies driving an xterra , because you pull up to a stoplight , and look over and there's an xterra next to you . they're always driven by chicks , so there's your icebreaker .

12649	0	a	how next to ? 
12650	1	a	well , here are your options: you can sell it for parts , drive it off a cliff . . . you can donate it to a person that you'd like to see die in a car crash , or , you can sell it to me , and i'll use it as i would a wagon on my farm . it will be towed by a donkey . 
12651	0	a	i have to pick one of those ? 
12652	1	a	yes . 
12653	0	a	can you go over those options again ? 
12654	1	a	you know what ? you knock $1500 of the price right now , and i will take it off your hands . it's gotta be now . 
12655	0	a	well i have the , the blue book value . . .

12669	3	a	well , you know , uh , the thing that you said earlier , that you didn't mean , um , and that i forgive you for . the whole thing's silly , isn't it ? friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as i'm concerned , so we are cool . 
12670	1	a	jim is in charge of stanley only in sales-related matters , hence the green line--green for money-sales , get it ? 
12671	3	a	uh huh . . . 
12672	1	a	there is this yellow zigzag that does give ryan the authority to discipline stanley . . . 
12673	3	a	great
12674	1	a	however , in so doing , it zigs past your name , hence zagging you and making you appear weak . thus the yellow color . yellow for cowardly . 
12675	3	a	what's the pink ? 
12676	1	a	menstrual cycles . 
12677	3	a	ok . . . is there anybody up here , anybody at all , that can deal with this ? 
12678	1	a	you . 
12679	3	a	other than me . 
12680	1	a	well , there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart . this gives me full authority over every single person in the office . 
12681	3	a	i never said you could do that . 
12682	1	a	all you have to do it say it . 
12683	3	a	i . . . 
12684	1	a	just say it .

12719	1	a	yeah , well . . . seller beware . now if you'll excuse me , i've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on ebay . 
12720	1	a	i've got a madlib for you: a stupid , idiotic , numbskull named andy bernard sold his xterra to a smart and capable man named dwight . this is shaping up to be an awesome day for dwight . 
12721	3	a	okay , everybody , shh ! so , earlier today , stanley sassed me , and toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him . they did not work , obviously , because they were stupid , so i am now going to fake fire him . 
12722	4	a	what does that mean ? 
12723	3	a	it's like a mock execution . 
12724	2	a	that's not a good idea . 
12725	3	a	yes it is a good idea . it's the only possible solution i have left . 
12726	3	a	no , okay . . . i've had enough of you . 
12727	3	a	because i want you to behave as if i'm actually firing him , oscar , okay ? 
12728	3	a	stanley hudson , you are fired . 
12729	3	a	i am serious , we are all serious . you are fired like a heart attack . 
12730	3	a	hmm . 
12731	3	a	alright alright , okay , you know what ? now you know how i feel . this was a fake firing . lesson learned . good work , everybody . very nice . 
12732	3	a	that's it . and uh . . . do you have anything to say to me ? 
12733	3	a	okay . . . 
12734	3	a	yes . 
12735	3	a	that's not-
12736	3	a	all right , all right . . . 
12737	3	a	okay . 
12738	3	a	hey , stop it ! okay , everybody out . 
12739	2	a	who ? 
12740	3	a	everybody , except stanley . 
12741	2	a	let's go . 
12742	4	a	i can't find my glasses . 
12743	2	a	okay , you know what ? why don't you take my hand , and leave them , and let's get out of here . 
12744	4	a	okay , okay . 
12745	3	a	 i don't understand why you keep picking on me . 
12746	3	a	you just , do , and i don't know why , so . . . please help me understand . 
12747	3	a	well stanley , maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well . 
12748	3	a	all right , you don't respect me . i accept that . but listen to me , you can't talk to me that way in this office , you just can't . i am your boss . can't allow it . 
12749	3	a	so i'm thinking , as a reward for our loyal clients , that we contact their assistants , and we find out where they live . and then , we go to their houses , in the middle of the summer , and go caroling . it is a summer christmas sale-abration . and we call it , a summer sales-a-lot . feedback ? anybody ? stanley ? 
12750	3	a	dammit , phyllis . alright , everybody out except phyllis . 
12751	3	a	you know , i don't care what he did to me . he's mean to other people , that's what gets me . he's just . . . 
12752	2	a	who else is he mean to ? 
12753	3	a	everybody . he just , he's always , he's always talking about people behind their backs to me . 
12754	4	a	what kind of stuff does stanley say ? 
12755	3	a	like that people are stupid , and that they're idiots , and that they're sluts . 
12756	3	a	because he's mean . he's , he's like a really mean-spirited guy . he talks about how gay oscar is . . . 
12757	2	a	mm-hmm . 
12758	3	a	and that angela's a midget , and that your chin is too big . 
12759	2	a	hey . 
12760	3	a	i know , i know . i think it's tiny . i think it's too small if anything . and that your glasses make you look ugly . 
12761	2	a	she's never worn these glasses before . 
12762	3	a	well , he's just mean . 
12763	4	a	michael , i think that what stanley did to you was rude . maybe you should just get him aside and tell him that he was behaving badly . 
12764	3	a	it's complicated , pam . i mean , the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk . 
12765	2	a	well , i actually agree with her , i think you should talk to him . and you also might want to explain to andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash . 
12766	3	a	okay . 
12767	3	a	i put stanley on a pedestal , for a long time . but sometimes he can just be a big , fat jerk . i . . . jerks don't deserve to be on pedestals . jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are . big marble . . . jerk stand . 
12768	3	a	pam , stand up . 
12769	4	a	hi everyone . my name is pam , and i wear glasses . 
12770	3	a	pretty disgusting . 
12771	4	a	thanks , phyllis . yours , too . 
12772	4	a	really ? 
12773	4	a	huh . maybe i will . 
12774	4	a	hi , can i help you ? 
12775	4	a	 ryan ! 
12776	4	a	yeah . 
12777	4	a	okay . 
12778	4	a	i've heard that . 
12779	4	a	okay . 
12780	4	a	yeah , if i could have seen what he just did , i think i would have gotten angry . 
12781	2	a	a formal warning , seriously ? 
12782	2	a	and no one cared . 
12783	2	a	productivity ? my numbers are good . 
12784	3	a	hey . ready ? come on , show me excited ! 
12785	3	a	yeah , i'm pretty excited too . 
12786	3	a	today i'm heading over to the job fair at valley view high school , to find some new interns . want to get some fresh blood . um , euthanize this place . 
12787	3	a	yup . 
12788	3	a	why are you dressed like that ? 
12789	3	a	like you're applying for a loan . 
12790	1	a	maybe he's going to church . or court . 
12791	4	a	 i think you look nice . 
12792	3	a	let's go ! 
12793	2	a	mr . maguire , it's been a couple of years . 
12794	0	a	oh no ! no , no-no-no-no ! my grandfather would be spinning in his urn , if he knew that i was out here with a dartmouth boy . you take that shirt off right now or i will take it off for you , sir . i am . . . totally and completely kidding ! andrew bernard , cornell '95 . 
12795	0	a	oop , got some blisties . 
12796	0	a	hit about 1200 balls last night , in preparation for today , so hands are a little tender . it's actually not funny at all . it's incredibly painful . 
12797	2	a	great ! 
12798	4	a	so many memories in this old gym . pretending i have pms so i didn't have to play volleyball , pretending i have pms so i didn't have to play basketball . those were the days ! 
12799	3	a	 a little over the top , don't you think ? 
12800	4	a	 um , that's all we brought . 
12801	3	a	this is all we need . 
12802	3	a	yes we will see oscar , we will see , because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities ! conceptual ! all right ! we . are . open for business ! hello ! 
12803	0	a	 giddy up , let's do this . 
12804	0	a	people assume i'm great at golf . but like everybody , i hated golf lessons when i was a kid . so , i used to hang out at the sailing club instead . got my 'knot' on . 
12805	0	a	 dammit ! 
12806	1	a	i will tell on you . 
12807	4	a	there's some filing , restocking the supply shelves . replacing the water jug , which nobody likes to do . um , we . . . uh , eat a lot of cake ! 
12808	4	a	 yeah , and uh , you basically learn how an office runs . 
12809	3	a	hello . hi . can i talk to you for a sec ? excuse me . 
12810	4	a	this is michael , my boss . justin . 
12811	3	a	hey , uh , remember what we talked about , in the car on the way up , 'only the best and the brightest . '
12812	4	a	he's nice and he seems interested . 
12813	3	a	he's totally wrong , pam . hey . 
12814	3	a	how you doing ? listen , i don't think that a handsome , funny , smart , funny-looking kid like you , should limit himself . you could do whatever you want to do . you could be a classy janitor , or a cashier with dignity , or a . . . migraine worker . maybe for you , paper should be more of a hobby . 
12815	3	a	oh , no problem . and he signed ! he put his name on the piece of - okay , that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams . and he just , made it into a stupid piece of paper . we need another one , immediately . 
12816	4	a	i only brought the one . 
12817	3	a	are you mental ? 
12818	4	a	michael , do you remember , you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper ? you said it only takes one sheet to make a difference . and i said , 'are you sure michael ? ' and you said 'pam ! pam ! pam ! ' and then you sneezed in my tea , and then you said , 'don't worry , it's just allergies . ' do you remember that ? 
12819	3	a	i . . . don't . 
12820	4	a	okay . i'll go look for another one . 
12821	3	a	and that . is why . i need a smart intern . 
12822	2	a	hey , so how's the direct mail business going ? 
12823	2	a	now are you getting all your paper from ppc ? or-
12824	2	a	absolutely , will do . 
12825	2	a	so i guess i'll just . . . work on my short game . 
12826	3	a	 hello there . 
12827	3	a	well it's funny that you should ask , because it's really more than a company . . . 
12828	3	a	dammit , oscar ! 
12829	3	a	yeah , i'm trying to lure these kids into my booth , but uh , kids are very wary about being 'lured' these days . thank you dateline ! 
12830	1	a	thank you . 
12831	4	a	my old art room . oh , maybe it's still here ! no . no they must have taken it down . never mind . 
12832	3	a	 what do you want ? 
12833	1	a	michael , i know you're swamped . i just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left , except for angela and i . do not worry though , i have taken down their names , and i have docked them a personal day . 
12834	3	a	who cares ? i'm not there , jim's not there , why should they have to be there ? 
12835	1	a	so . . . what else is up ? mich-
12836	3	a	thank you ! what , what is this ? 
12837	4	a	a piece of paper . 
12838	3	a	this isn't dunder mifflin paper . some sort of pendleton crap . 
12839	4	a	well i think they'll get the spirit of it . 
12840	3	a	pam-pam-pam-pam-pampampampam ! we're dying here . i want you to go back to the office and i want you to get the real stuff . i want you to get ultra white card stock . 
12841	4	a	are you serious ? 
12842	3	a	yes . and don't call me shirley . 
12843	4	a	okay . 
12844	2	a	you know , you can just pick it up , take the triple bogey . 
12845	2	a	yep . 
12846	0	a	 ah ! come on , tuna ! 
12847	2	a	hey , can't really talk now , what's up ? 
12848	4	a	just checking in , how's it going ? 
12849	2	a	uh , you know , we'll see , we'll see . 
12850	4	a	i just drove twenty miles round-trip back to the office to get michael a single sheet of white paper . so , i could have just had them fax it to me , i guess . 
12851	2	a	oh , i like you . 
12852	4	a	talk to you later ? 
12853	2	a	yeah . all right . bye . all right . sorry , i got to annoy you one more time . what if i bring down shipping costs ? 
12854	0	a	all right , race to the next hole ! 
12855	0	a	shortcut ! shortcut ! woah ! i fell in the sandtrap ! 
12856	3	a	all of these jobs ? suck . i would rather live jobless , on a beach somewhere , off the money from a large inheritance , than to have to work in any one of these crap-holes . they suck . 
12857	3	a	hey ! game over . 
12858	3	a	 just-in time . 
12859	3	a	just-in case . what's your last name ? 
12860	3	a	this . . . just in . justin polznik ! huh ? 
12861	3	a	justin is the ugly girl in the movie , who takes off her glasses and she's hot ! and you realize she was always hot , she was just wearing glasses . and that you were the blind one . he's the most . . . important thing in my life right now . 
12862	3	a	i want you to meet my family . come on . oscar martinez . accountant extraordinaire . this is justin . 
12863	3	a	this is darryl philbin . isn't he big ? and you already met her , pam beesly , office hottie . she will 'do' you . no , no . but she has already dated two guys in the office , that we know of , so , this could be number three , you never know ? 
12864	4	a	excuse me . 
12865	3	a	come here . i would never say this to her face , but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist . 
12866	3	a	so , what do you think ? think these guys are nice ? the guys i didn't bring are even better . justin , i'm willing to commit right now . would you do me the honor , of spending the summer with us , at dunder mifflin ? i think , i think you are very special .

12959	1	a	 argh ! ahh ! ! 
12960	3	a	today is toby flenderson's last day . i couldn't sleep last night . i came extra-early . so much energy . . . there are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life , and i just have a feeling that today is one of those days . 
12961	3	a	mornin' . so here we go , just a matter of hours now , until his horribleness has left the building . i'm going to set my watch alarm . . . and . . . 
12962	3	a	first thing on the agenda-actually , the only thing on the agenda , is the status of toby's going away party . 
12963	3	a	okay . 
12964	3	a	okay , well , this will not do . toby is going away forever , and uh , we need to do something very very special . in some cultures , when somebody leaves , like new orleans culture , they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets . . . 
12965	4	a	do you mean , leaves as in dies ? you want us to throw toby a new orleans' funeral ? 
12966	3	a	if the devil were to explode , and evil were gone forever , what sort of party would you have ? 
12967	3	a	like a beach blowout ? or a toga , toga-
12968	3	a	toga ! 
12969	3	a	i thought that you might say that . 
12970	3	a	i want a party that makes me feel like i am flying through the air without this . . . ugly weight holding me down , you know ? . . . i want an antigravity machine . i saw it in a movie . you drink a potion , and then you just start floating all around . 
12971	4	a	so how much antigravity potion do you want ? 
12972	3	a	phyllis , can you do this ? 
12973	4	a	hi , can i help you ? 
12974	4	a	hey . 
12975	2	a	hey . . . what ? 
12976	4	a	guess who just got into the pratt school of design . 
12977	2	a	no way ! what did i say ? i said that they'd love those sketches . congratulations ! 
12978	4	a	oh , thank you ! i don't know why i doubted it , because i'm so clearly awesome ! 
12979	2	a	yes ! so when do you start ? 
12980	4	a	i don't know , i didn't read it carefully , i just saw 'congratulations' and i skimmed the list , i saw my name , i came in here to tell you and get a snack . 
12981	2	a	wow . busy morning . 
12982	4	a	so , you know it means i have to go to new york for three months . . . 
12983	2	a	it's not a big deal . i'll come visit you . and you'll visit me . it's only two hours away . it'll be fine . that part's gonna suck , but it'll be great . 
12984	4	a	yeah , it sucks , but it'll be great . 
12985	2	a	see how easy that is ? 
12986	4	a	ohh . . . 
12987	4	a	i wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with jim . and down the road , if we have a family , i couldn't go then either . so , the timing's perfect . . . and that is the first time i've ever used the word 'perfect' in here ! 
12988	3	a	 toby's replacement . ugh . wow . 
12989	1	a	so what do we know about her ? 
12990	3	a	well , we know that toby thinks she'll be great . so , strike one , i hate her already . 
12991	1	a	i hate her too . 
12992	3	a	why do you hate her ? 
12993	1	a	because she . . . stinks . . . with her . . . ways . . . and her . . . head . 
12994	3	a	you know , dwight , sometimes . . . i don't know , i think you say things just to agree with me . 
12995	1	a	would that be such a bad thing ?

13008	3	a	thanks to toby , i have a very strong prejudice against human resources . i believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters . what i failed to consider though , is that not all monsters are bad . like e . t . is holly our extraterrestrial ? maybe . or maybe she's just an awesome woman from this planet . 
13009	1	a	 have you been introduced to kevin ? 
13010	1	a	he's here on a special work program . he's slow , you know , in his brain .

13013	1	a	accounting department , listen up . holly , human resources . angela , oscar , and kevin . 
13014	3	a	here she is ! holly . . . you know , if we hung holly from the ceiling , we'd have to kiss underneath of her . so-i know . oh , sorry . question , are you real , or are you a hollygram ?

13157	4	a	 yay , phyllis !

13244	1	a	the website is hiding , forming alliances with other sites , preparing an attack for which we will have no defense . 
13245	2	a	do you honestly believe that ? 
13246	1	a	yes , i do . 
13247	2	a	i'm gonna get a second opinion . 
13248	0	a	it was down for a couple hours yesterday , then back up , and now i've heard from a very reliable source that it is once again out of commission . and that reliable source is you .

13441	1	a	i am hardly the problem , jim .

13443	1	a	this is what i'm gonna do . i'm gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction . uhhhhh stanley , phyllis , kevin . and you will be responsible for your own medical bills . 
13444	1	a	hello phyllis . do you have a minute ? listen . i'm really sorry . . . about what i said before . ok ? i was way out of line .

13447	3	a	mmm-hmm . saunas . 
13448	3	a	gah , the dreadmill .

13461	2	a	see , you're always saying there's something wrong with society , but . . . maybe there's something wrong with you . 
13462	3	a	if it's me , then society made me that way . now , i know a lot of you are probably asking yourself , 'why are you dressed in a plus sized suit ? '
13463	3	a	how do you know michael clump ? 
13464	3	a	how dare you ! michael clump is a celebration of fat people . 
13465	1	a	no , no , no , it goes , it goes . . . look , 'i say , i say , i say , i'll sit on you ! '

13668	3	a	oh no , no , no . your food is no good here , my lady . sorry ! you know what ? let's go out ! dunder mifflin's treat . um , actually you're not a client . . . so . . . we'll just split it ? ethical .

13680	2	a	actually not . it was really so-so . 
13681	1	a	ok . 
13682	2	a	i mean i like all the crazy monsters and stuff . you know , like klingons and wookies and all that but . . . sorry , was there something you wanted to add , dwight ? 
13683	0	a	is that anything like the original battlestar galactica ? 
13684	2	a	you know , it's weird . it's practically a shot for shot remake . 
13685	0	a	really ? huh , that's cool . 
13686	2	a	story's kinda bland . it's about this guy named dumbledore calrissian who needs to return the ring back to mordor . 
13687	0	a	really ? that doesn't sound right . 
13688	3	a	i just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance . i mean , what sort of place is that to call home ? and meredith needs this job . this is her main source of money . 
13689	3	a	ok , new idea . we don't report it at all . we just punish her . 
13690	3	a	mmhmm , tell her she can't have sex for six months . 
13691	3	a	i don't know . i saw this thing , like a belt with a key . 
13692	3	a	no , it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of , sometimes they are made of metal . you know what i am talking about . you unlock a little door that . . . down . . . where you , where you put , where you put the . . . 
13693	3	a	i am just saying that i don't think that you understand what i am saying . 
13694	3	a	yes . 
13695	3	a	well . . . bleh busted . i don't . . . 
13696	3	a	well , you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family . 
13697	3	a	i will be honest with you . that car ride did not go well and that was not my fault . the only reason i am standing out here right now is because i don't want to take the elevator with her . and i am holding on to her leftovers . 
13698	2	a	 19 minutes and 48 seconds . what were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds ? 
13699	1	a	none of your business . 
13700	2	a	so i guess i can assume that was personal . 
13701	1	a	 fine . 
13702	2	a	so maybe you're not completely ethical after all . 
13703	1	a	yes , maybe i'm not . 
13704	3	a	what's the only thing worse than one hr rep ? 
13705	3	a	you get me . 
13706	3	a	i don't know . can you ? kendall , my main man . 
13707	3	a	let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar . 
13708	3	a	how do you tell somebody that you care about deeply , 'i told you so . ' gently with a rose ? in a funny way , like it's a hilarious joke ? or do you just let it go , because saying it would just make things worse ? . . . probably the funny way . 
13709	0	a	no way , lady . 
13710	3	a	ok , everybody listen up . if you are not in that conference room in two minutes i am going to kill you . 
13711	3	a	get in there right now or i'm gonna lose it !

13926	3	a	you're welcome . 
13927	3	a	in my opinion , the third date is traditionally the one where . . . you have sex . does holly feel that way ? i don't know . i will probably find out tonight . if she starts having sex with me i'll know for sure . 
13928	0	a	that's for you . and , um , oh . i am right in assuming that dwight is short for d-money . 'cause that's what i wrote on your save-the-date .

13937	3	a	okay , so , we do the restaurant thing and then . . . then . . . then we can do . . . we'll just do the restaurant thing first .

14063	3	a	okay . 
14064	2	a	mmm-hmm . 
14065	3	a	the wildcard is dinner at a nice restaurant . 
14066	2	a	uh-oh . 
14067	3	a	exactly . here , here are my sure things . i blindfold her . i take her to the houdini museum . she chains me up . . . 
14068	2	a	i think i got a pretty good sense of that one . 
14069	3	a	okay . 
14070	2	a	yep . 
14071	3	a	all right . 
14072	2	a	let's move on to the next . 
14073	3	a	number two , we go to the mall . . . 
14074	2	a	mmm-hmm . 
14075	3	a	we go to the bed store , i let her choose whatever bed she wants . . . 
14076	2	a	oh , that's good . 
14077	3	a	and we have sex on it . 
14078	2	a	i like the wild card . i'm already liking the wild card . 
14079	3	a	really ? i don't know . it's a big third date , jim . 
14080	2	a	mmm-hmm . 
14081	3	a	what do i do ? 
14082	2	a	have you asked her what she wants to do ? 
14083	3	a	well , i thought as the man that i should make the decision . 
14084	2	a	no . you got that backwards . 
14085	3	a	times have changed , jim . 
14086	1	a	i'll bring you one tomorrow . you've earned it . mmm . i hope you like fox meat . 
14087	0	a	 meow . sweet 'stume , dude . who are you supposed to be ? 
14088	2	a	dave . 
14089	0	a	cool . 
14090	2	a	you are ? a cat ? 
14091	0	a	 we were looking for 'kitten . '
14092	2	a	 oh , hang on one second . jim halpert . 
14093	4	a	hey . 
14094	2	a	hey new york , happy halloween ! 
14095	4	a	thanks . my costume's getting a lot of attention . 
14096	4	a	so apparently no one dresses up for halloween here . i wish i had known that before i used greasepaint for my moustache . and i can't even take off my hat , because then i'm hitler . 
14097	1	a	 hm mm mm mm . want to see a magic trick ? heh heh heh ! i'm gonna make a pencil disapp-- oh ! disappear . 
14098	3	a	okay , i think we are set . we have puzzles , string for cat's cradles . burned this last night . a little road trip cd . puppets . 
14099	3	a	when corporate found out that we were dating , they decided they were going to transfer holly back to her old branch , in nashua , new hampshire . 
14100	3	a	road trip ! right ? 
14101	3	a	oh , copy that breaker . those duke boys are at it again . 
14102	3	a	we're not . 
14103	3	a	we're not doing anything . 
14104	3	a	all right everybody . i'm out of here . jim , you're in charge . 
14105	2	a	oh , i'll walk you out . 
14106	3	a	ah , you are quite the gentleman . 
14107	3	a	you can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want . 
14108	2	a	all right . we'll see . no . 
14109	2	a	i am off to new york . my brother pete from boston , and my brother tom from new jersey are taking pam and i out for lunch , to celebrate the engagement . or maybe to beat me up . i can never tell with those two . 
14110	1	a	good morning temp . 
14111	1	a	thought i'd go casual today . morning everyone . good morning . hello . how are you phyllis ? 
14112	0	a	ha ha ha . that's funny . take that sweatshirt off ! hey buddy . 
14113	1	a	andy . 
14114	0	a	remember when i jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off ? totally joking . but , you should know , those colors are sacred . not that i care . but if you're not a cornell man , you probably shouldn't wear them . 
14115	1	a	no i get it . i totally understand . and uh , i just want to assure you , that i mean no disrespect . you see , i'm applying ! 
14116	0	a	come on , you think you can get into cornell ? 
14117	1	a	well if somebody who barely out-sells phyllis , can get in , i should be fine . 
14118	1	a	i meant that as a compliment to you phyllis , as well as a slight to andy . 
14119	1	a	cornell is a good school , and i want to better myself through higher education . if it makes andy angry , so be it . 
14120	3	a	cool ! 
14121	3	a	we're gonna switch back and forth , the driving . sometimes we'll just meet in the middle . it'll be fun . wait a sec . oh i love this song . 
14122	1	a	hey there . so uh , how do you think we're gonna do against penn this year ? nathan ford's arm looks pretty strong . 
14123	0	a	well he's had a pretty good season so far--- stop saying 'we . ' you did not go to cornell . okay , you're just doing this to screw with me . 
14124	1	a	not so . cornell is an excellent school . without its agricultural program , we probably wouldn't have cabbage . at least not modern cabbage . 
14125	0	a	i know it's an excellent school , dwight . i went there . my blood runs big red . 
14126	1	a	someday , we'll both get together in comstock hall and just laugh about all of this . 
14127	4	a	hey !

14129	4	a	i asked tom and pete to come early so we could play a prank on jim at lunch ! pretty awesome , right ? i think they're into the idea . they're probably thinking , 'that pam beasly , she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet . she's the best ! the absolute best . '
14130	4	a	okay , so here's what i'm thinking . i'm gonna say that before ceramics class , i took off my ring , and then when i changed back out of my smock , it wasn't in my pocket anymore , and i lost it . 
14131	4	a	so , not the ring then ? the- the- not doing the ring ? 
14132	4	a	okay , okay .

14145	3	a	here we go , fourth time's a charm . 'life's like a road where you just . . . one day here , and the next day back . . . sometimes you deal with it , today you don't , sometimes you do , what you want . . . there's a world out there . . . . hey . are you crying ? 
14146	3	a	allergies ?

14481	1	a	you are the master . 
14482	2	a	there is one condition , michael . 
14483	3	a	yes . 
14484	2	a	you have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly . 
14485	1	a	don't do it , michael . 
14486	3	a	 . . . it's a million-dollar sale . 
14487	0	a	so it's called the shangri-la tent . it's two stories , heated and has a bridal suite for my bridal sweet . it's just really simple , really tasteful . 
14488	0	a	hobos live in trains . 
14489	0	a	well , nana mim -- ahh . ok , look . this tent is awesome . and it's in high demand , so i really think we should put a deposit down now . 
14490	0	a	done and done-er . 
14491	0	a	do you have a specific place in mind ? 
14492	0	a	on it ! 
14493	2	a	dwight . dwight . 
14494	1	a	get in ! 
14495	2	a	are you serious ? 
14496	1	a	get in ! 
14497	2	a	ok , what are you --
14498	1	a	shh . they might be listening to us . 
14499	2	a	what's that ? 
14500	1	a	they might be listening to us
14501	2	a	who's they ? 
14502	1	a	customer service might be monitoring this conversation . 
14503	2	a	in this car ? 
14504	1	a	you never know . better safe than sorry . 
14505	2	a	 what are you thinking ? 
14506	1	a	who stands to benefit from our downfall ? 
14507	2	a	the mob , maybe nasa . 
14508	1	a	could be the mob . but then dunder-mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering , and there's little evidence of that . 
14509	2	a	is there some evidence ? 
14510	4	a	 ooh , cute shoes online . 
14511	2	a	how many shoes do you need ? 
14512	1	a	i don't know . two , maybe three if one wears out . how many shoes do you need ? 
14513	2	a	i'm not talking to you . 
14514	1	a	who are you talking to ? 
14515	2	a	pam . 
14516	1	a	she's not here , jim . 
14517	2	a	no , she's not . 
14518	4	a	 na na na na na . na na na na na na na . 
14519	0	a	 yes ! 
14520	0	a	i found it . i found the perfect place . a local bed-and-breakfast on a 60-acre beet farm . and even better , i have an in with the owner . oh , yeah . we work together . it's dwight schrute . as in schrute farms . 
14521	1	a	wait , shut up . 
14522	1	a	shh . do you hear that ? 
14523	1	a	breathing . is that you ? 
14524	1	a	well , stop . hold your breath . i still hear it . who's there ? kelly , is that you ? hold on . 
14525	1	a	 ha ! 
14526	1	a	hear anything interesting ? 
14527	1	a	 i think you know . 
14528	1	a	what are you up to , girl ? huh ? phyllis put you up to this ? stanley ? are they paying you ? 
14529	1	a	of course i am . i know you're the mastermind , but you're too stupid to do it by yourself . 
14530	2	a	: ok . 
14531	1	a	 ah ! 
14532	2	a	easy . 
14533	1	a	ok . 
14534	2	a	let's just -- let's head back to the desk . 
14535	1	a	the reason that i got bad customer reviews is because i didn't ! there is a massive conspiracy going on here , and i know you're involved . 
14536	4	a	 that's what she said ! that's what she said ! that's what she said ! 
14537	2	a	good one . 
14538	2	a	 hey . sorry about dwight , by the way . 
14539	2	a	well , we all handle it differently . i personally choose to handle it like a normal person , but . . . 
14540	2	a	hey , how are you and darryl ? 
14541	2	a	bye . 
14542	4	a	 that was weird . 
14543	2	a	what was ? 
14544	4	a	have you ever had a conversation with kelly where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath ? 
14545	2	a	no , actually . 
14546	4	a	did you do something to her ? 
14547	2	a	i don't think so . 
14548	4	a	well , something's off . 
14549	2	a	hey , how's things ? 
14550	2	a	yeah ? 
14551	2	a	do you have any reason to believe that kelly would be mad at me ? 
14552	2	a	wait , that's pretty weird . 
14553	2	a	well , andy has a mug just like that . 
14554	2	a	no . what party ? 
14555	2	a	i wasn't . but thank you . do you know anything about this party ? 
14556	4	a	yes , i said you definitely should go , but you wanted to visit me instead . 
14557	2	a	well , i can't be the only one who didn't -- 
14558	2	a	dwight , let me see your coffee cup . 
14559	1	a	no . 
14560	2	a	is that it ? 
14561	1	a	no . why ? no . 
14562	2	a	ok , i'm gonna assume that was it . here's the thing: i think you're right . i think it was kelly . i think she's mad at us for not coming to her party . 
14563	1	a	oh , man , i knew it . who are her co-conspirators ? 
14564	2	a	probably just kelly . 
14565	1	a	obviously . i knew it . 
14566	2	a	that's what i'm saying . 
14567	1	a	yeah . what ? 
14568	2	a	you were right . 
14569	1	a	i was -- i was right . 
14570	2	a	you were right . 
14571	1	a	i was right . 
14572	2	a	you knew it . 
14573	1	a	i knew it . 
14574	2	a	you knew it the whole time , buddy . 
14575	1	a	i knew it the whole time , buddy ! 
14576	2	a	wow . 
14577	1	a	yeah ! woo-hoo ! 
14578	4	a	 right dwight is loud .

14580	2	a	no , no , no , no . dwight , dwight , dwight . let's talk about this . 
14581	3	a	why don't you tell us ? 
14582	1	a	let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern india , who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit . 
14583	3	a	dwight . i was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate . 
14584	1	a	oh , come on . you juked the stats , cupcake . 
14585	2	a	we called about a dozen customers , and they all said that they gave us great marks . 
14586	3	a	what's going on ? 
14587	3	a	 kelly . 
14588	3	a	you cannot say 'i was raped' and expect all of your problems to go away , kelly . not again . don't keep doing that . i'll give you one last chance to come clean . just tell me what happened . 
14589	1	a	we have our confession . i'm calling security . 
14590	3	a	don't . don't . get away from that , dwight , please . you know what ? she's got a point about you two . you do have a problem dealing with people . 
14591	3	a	you were lying . 
14592	3	a	yes . jim , dwight , please excuse us . 
14593	1	a	i want to be here when you fire her ass . 
14594	3	a	i will call you when it is time . 
14595	3	a	i think you should do that . 
14596	4	a	hey , what are you doing here ?

14598	4	a	it's alex . 
14599	2	a	oh , that's gonna be great . who's chuck close ? 
14600	4	a	oh , i love chuck close and his photo-realist paintings . but i have to work .

14602	2	a	that's it . i want to talk to this guy . put me in his ear . 
14603	4	a	what's up ? 
14604	4	a	wow . 
14605	2	a	i'm gonna make a bigger leap here . he is into you . 
14606	4	a	because they have a great design program , and i wanted to see if i was any good at it . and i wanted to work on my art , too . 
14607	4	a	jim's in scranton . 
14608	4	a	i'll see you tomorrow . 
14609	1	a	is that the matsuhashi b-400 ? the world's tiniest bluetooth ? may i ? 
14610	2	a	don't . 
14611	1	a	congratulations on choosing schrute farms for your wedding . 
14612	0	a	we haven't decided on anything yet . we're still reviewing some options , and it's gonna come down to the numbers . 
14613	1	a	well , then . why don't you look over some of our materials ? 
14614	0	a	oh . hmm . 
14615	0	a	that's very generous . 
14616	1	a	while you , my good friend , have nothing more to worry about . this wedding is officially out of your hands . 
14617	0	a	oh , thank the good lord . deal ! 
14618	1	a	ok .

14621	0	a	can't argue with that . dwight . . . you are going to make us so happy . 
14622	3	a	and she took a bite , started to choke . so what do i do ? i have cpr training . go around , start doing the heimlich . 
14623	2	a	perfect . 
14624	3	a	the ring , 10-carat diamond , pops out of her mouth , hits her shrimp cocktail , right onto her finger . million-to-one shot . all of the greek people in the restaurant start screaming 'opa ! ' which means 'congratulations , ' so . . . 
14625	0	a	oh , man ! 
14626	4	a	 ask how he's doing since the breakup . 
14627	2	a	so , how you holdin' up ? 
14628	3	a	i'm pretty much devastated . 
14629	4	a	ask if there's anything you can do . 
14630	2	a	you know what you should do ? take a vacation . 
14631	3	a	maybe go to sandals , jamaica . or the other sandals , jamaica . i just don't want to go by myself . 
14632	4	a	tell him you'd like to go with him . 
14633	2	a	we should take a look at those surveys . 
14634	3	a	great marks , phyllis . 
14635	0	a	 up ! don't leave me hangin' ! 
14636	1	a	what do i do with my bonus check ? simple . purchase paper from myself . boosts my sales , which boosts my bonus . last year i bought even more paper to make this year's bonus even bigger . eventually , i'll get a bonus so big i can retire on it . and i'll use the paper to write my memoirs . 
14637	3	a	i taught jim and dwight everything i know about sales . but there are certain things that cannot be taught , and it is these things that i now must teach them . 
14638	3	a	attention , all problem sales persons . jim halpert . . . dwight schrute . . . 
14639	1	a	 here . 
14640	3	a	intensive one-on-one retraining will begin after lunch . that is all . 
14641	0	a	i am no longer the worst salesman in the office . yes ! ow ! dammit ! 
14642	2	a	dwight and i are both writing letters to our clients . i'm just sending a quick note to say how much i appreciate their business , and he is writing notarized letters to inform them them that lying on customer reviews is a prosecutable form of fraud and defamation . it's just . . . different styles . 
14643	1	a	my job is to manipulate the customer into buying paper . in return , they give me money . i am the predator and they are the prey . would a mouse give a positive review to a hawk ? should the hawk even care ? excuse me , i've got work to do . 
14644	1	a	hey , what are you laughing at ? 
14645	1	a	are you laughing at me ? 
14646	1	a	 how is that funny ? what are you really laughing at ? huh ? 
14647	1	a	 there's no way you're laughing at this . 
14648	2	a	 oh , i don't have anything to say . i'm just hiding from dwight . 
14649	2	a	so , as it turns out , dwight is right . how bizarre . 
14650	4	a	 i wonder what else dwight's been right about . . . . 
14651	1	a	major pharmaceuticals do not want you to know that beet juice has medicinal value both as an aphrodisiac and a laxative . 
14652	1	a	the scranton zoning board has a strong bias against beet farmers . the mayor is in the pocket of big lettuce . 
14653	1	a	battlestar galactica isn't a documentary exactly . 
14654	1	a	the book all the president's men is about a conspiracy , just not the one people think . 
14655	1	a	jesus had a daughter , and she was the mona lisa . 
14656	1	a	what we have come to know as fake crab meat is in fact real crab meat , and real crab meat is lobster . 
14657	3	a	did you know that in morocco it is common to exchange a small gift when meeting somebody for the first time ? in japan you must always commit suicide to avoid embarrassment . in italy you must always wash your hands after going to the bathroom . this is considered to be polite . 
14658	2	a	why are you telling us this ? 
14659	3	a	i am jetting off on an international business trip . 
14660	2	a	where are you going ? 
14661	3	a	to can-a-da . 
14662	2	a	where is it ? 
14663	3	a	canada . 
14664	2	a	okay . 
14665	3	a	my boss is sending me abroad to do a presentation to an international client and i have always been intrigued by all things international . the women , the pancakes , the man of mystery . . . 
14666	3	a	meredith , i would like you to pretend that you are from abu dhabi . 
14667	3	a	i am ashamed at your naked face . i must cover it with my jacket . you are now sexy in your culture . 
14668	2	a	six point five days . 
14669	2	a	pam comes back from new york next week and everyone here has just been so excited for me . and involved . and intrusive . and weird . 
14670	3	a	i have my passport . 
14671	3	a	i have my per diem . i already know what i am going to spend this on . i am going to buy a sweater . 
14672	3	a	well i'll just . . . i'll use different money for that . 
14673	3	a	and business class air , like a five-star hotel in the sky , nothing but the best . actually better than a five-star hotel 'cause you get a big , cushy seat and you sit in a row of people and to eat , whatever the mind can imagine . i think i am going to have a filet with mushroom sauce . 
14674	3	a	well that is all in the past . 
14675	3	a	they have one of those ? 
14676	3	a	 lets do this ! 
14677	1	a	wait , why do you need three suitcases ? 
14678	3	a	two are for souvenirs . 
14679	1	a	do you have your money belt ? 
14680	3	a	i do . it's right here . 
14681	1	a	no , no , no , no , no . you want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra . 
14682	3	a	no , i don't want to wear a bra . 
14683	1	a	here , let me help you . 
14684	3	a	stop it ! stop it ! 
14685	1	a	do you want to get robbed in a foreign country ? i wash my hands of this . 
14686	3	a	okay . where is my translator ?

14731	0	a	one final question . where might you find yourself on a winnipeg night like tonight ? 
14732	0	a	 the huntsman . 
14733	3	a	a concierge is like the winnipeg equivalent of a geisha . this is a woman who has been trained in the fine art of fanciness and pleasure . and when you meet one , it is intoxicating . just what the doctor ordered . 
14734	4	a	 can't believe this .

15212	3	a	okay . 
15213	4	a	you can try mine . 
15214	3	a	oh , there we go .

15218	3	a	well , what should i do ?

15227	0	a	are we , uh . . . are we leaving or what ? ow ! 
15228	3	a	hey david- i'm sorry . i'm sorry . i'm eating tiramisu . some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat . i'm stopping now . 
15229	3	a	no , no , no , no , no . no . i'm calling- i'm sorry . 
15230	3	a	mm . i'm calling because , um , we have a stupid budget surplus , and people-everybody wants something different . 
15231	3	a	no , no , no . i want you to make the decision so i'm not the bad guy . 
15232	3	a	the what now ? 
15233	3	a	 . . . like a tip ? $645 ? ! 
15234	3	a	i hate disappointing just one person . and i really hate disappointing everyone . but i love burlington coat factory . you go in there with $645 , you are literally a king . 
15235	2	a	 we have that going out tuesday . . . okay ? sure , no , i can . . . i'll double-check that for you . 
15236	3	a	all right , attention everyone . 
15237	2	a	let me call you right back . okay . 
15238	3	a	i have made my decision . we do not need a new copier . we do not need new chairs . this copier . . . is . . . working perfectly . 
15239	3	a	do i know what ? 
15240	3	a	mm , no . . . 
15241	4	a	yeah , know what ? 
15242	3	a	$645 . 00

15244	3	a	because that is how my mind works . 
15245	2	a	wait , what ? 
15246	4	a	you can do that ? 
15247	3	a	let's see . . . 
15248	4	a	you're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs ? 
15249	3	a	i don't need $645; i already have $645 , more or less . 
15250	3	a	this is so stupid . 
15251	4	a	or chairs ? 
15252	3	a	this is so , so stupid . and , god . . . that's my phone . 
15253	3	a	to be continued ! 
15254	3	a	no , i don't-this doesn't change anything . i have a very important decision to make . we need a new copier . we need new chairs . and i need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me .

15259	3	a	 you think it's easy ? 
15260	3	a	okay , you know what ? why don't you guys deal with it ? i am going to get up , and i am going to be out in the common area . but you need to decide; otherwise i'm taking the bonus . all right ? 
15261	3	a	it is a classic management tactic . you have two sides , a deadline , you know that neither of them are gonna concede . what you do is you put 'em in a room , and you just- hey . 
15262	4	a	hey . 
15263	3	a	what ? 
15264	4	a	thanks michael . 
15265	3	a	good work . i'm proud of you . mother-

15273	1	a	yeah , no such thing . they don't give out black belts for things that are stupid . well , i hope it was worth it , cause i'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes . 
15274	2	a	i think it'll take you a little longer than that . 
15275	1	a	really ? if i can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes , i ought to be able to cut my -- 
15276	3	a	hey , phyllis , do i need this invite to get in to the party ?

15278	2	a	ah . you brought in your doll collection . 
15279	1	a	these are not dolls , jim . these are commodities . same as gold or oil . 
15280	2	a	that's the christmas spirit . 
15281	1	a	i am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift . and such a genetically improbable one . look at that . how does that happen ? king has sex with a unicorn ? man with a horn has sex with a royal horse ? 
15282	2	a	yes .

15296	2	a	wow , that is delicious . 
15297	3	a	yeah . 
15298	2	a	can't believe no ones thought of that . 
15299	3	a	i know .

15305	2	a	 oh , oh , oh , oh ! 
15306	1	a	we got a live one ! on fire ! ! 
15307	0	a	sorry . 
15308	3	a	can not do it then . monthly dental appointment , soft teeth
15309	2	a	ah . . . would you want to do it on groundhogs day ? 
15310	3	a	no , no . i celebrate privately . 
15311	2	a	that's cool . 
15312	3	a	why don't we just do it now ? we'll do it quickly . 
15313	3	a	we'll do it quickly . 
15314	2	a	well what if we can't do it quickly . 
15315	3	a	 what if we can't do it quickly ? what if we cant do it--
15316	3	a	hey , shut up . here we go . everybody gather up . 
15317	3	a	an intervention . it's sort of hard to describe , but really its-- it's a coming together . . . it's a surprise party for people who are-- who have addictions . and you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves . and then they stop . 
15318	3	a	okay , how do you feel ? 
15319	3	a	uck . . . t . m . i . 
15320	2	a	yeah . 
15321	3	a	okay , you know what i thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party . 
15322	3	a	i am not asking her to stop drinking . i am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic . 
15323	3	a	yeah , obviously you are . okay , everybody who thinks that meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand . 
15324	1	a	aye . 
15325	3	a	the aye's have it . 
15326	3	a	alright , well , let's look at this a little bit closer then shall we ? 
15327	3	a	meredith , have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind ? 
15328	3	a	do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday ? 
15329	3	a	have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the mormon church ? 
15330	3	a	i got it on a website , that's not important . 
15331	3	a	okay , you know what toby ? one of my employees is undergoing a crisis and i wish for just once you would take my side on this . i'm doing your job man . hey , are you texting ? 
15332	3	a	that's-- you didn't-- you weren't hurt by that . 
15333	3	a	okay , no , that's not what we're going for . who has a problem with meredith's drinking ? it has to bother you . it bothers me . right ? how does it bother you ? dwight , don't you have anything ? 
15334	1	a	no , i like meredith . 
15335	1	a	actually , i don't care for meredith , but i don't believe in this kind of thing . in the schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention . awareness , education , control , acceptance and punching . 
15336	3	a	who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke ? who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night ? 
15337	3	a	was john belushi fine ? was bob hope fine ? hey-- come here . if anything ever happened to you , i would be very angry at myself for not doing all that i could do . 
15338	3	a	i want you to say i'm an alcoholic . 
15339	3	a	you can say it as loudly as you want , but we're not going to believe you . 
15340	3	a	 alright , no , no , no . no . that is the image , i think we can all agree is very disgusting . but you know what , meredith , you lit your hair on fire today . what about tomorrow . ? what is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead ? 
15341	1	a	i stab her in the brain with a wooden stick . 
15342	1	a	there are several ways to kill a zombie , but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick . 
15343	3	a	everyone in this room loves you , but mark my words , we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore . the next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out . 
15344	1	a	oh , as fire marshal i would have to . 
15345	3	a	dwight--

15667	1	a	no . 
15668	3	a	they could be shrinking . 
15669	1	a	no because their sign is centered perfectly above their store . no sign of the sign being moved . 
15670	3	a	ah ha yup . 
15671	1	a	 its lunch time , and no sign of anyone coming in or out . which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch . 
15672	3	a	mm hmm . 
15673	1	a	which means they're not acquiring new business . so once again no growth . 
15674	3	a	and there are clouds . there are clouds in the sky , which means gonna rain , bad for business . 
15675	1	a	oh , it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus . 
15676	3	a	argh , why are you all . . . 
15677	1	a	get your clouds right . 
15678	3	a	shut up .

15680	1	a	yeah . 
15681	3	a	good . here come the sharks . 
15682	3	a	in nature , there is something called a food chain; it's where the shark eats a little shark . and the little shark eats a littler shark . and so on and so on . until you get down to the single cell shark . so now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business . 
15683	3	a	hello . 
15684	3	a	my name is michael scarn . i am a local business owner and i would like to find out about your company .

15700	2	a	i think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures , you know ? we don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people .

15754	1	a	they could do better .

15756	1	a	what ? 
15757	3	a	live and let live . 
15758	1	a	i'm not familiar with that expression , 
15759	3	a	it's from james bond . 
15760	1	a	it doesn't make sense , of course i'm alive . 
15761	3	a	i'm not going to make this call . 
15762	1	a	michael , you have to . have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub ? have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate ? have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel ?

15770	1	a	yeah , save your heart for love , and use your brain for business , right ? if we don't do this to prince paper , someone else will . worse yet , someone else will do it to us . 
15771	1	a	there was a terrible war , ugh , so many died . far too many died . but if frodo hadn't destroyed the ring , then goodness itself might have died . 
15772	3	a	you're right . 
15773	1	a	yeah . 
15774	3	a	you are right . i will call david and give him the customer list and i will give him all my info .

15850	0	a	you're choking him ! 
15851	3	a	saving him ! 
15852	1	a	a lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time . 
15853	3	a	electricity . 
15854	1	a	shampoo . 
15855	1	a	i just want to say for the record , i did not kill anyone . stanley was attacked by his own heart . and he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days . 
15856	1	a	yes i shouted 'fire ! ' . i shouted many things ! i also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building , so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--
15857	3	a	hed . hedded
15858	1	a	when no one hedded--
15859	3	a	take hedded of . 
15860	1	a	n-no one would take hedded of my instructions . 
15861	3	a	heed . heed . 
15862	1	a	so , you--
15863	3	a	take heed of . 
15864	1	a	and , well , i don't see my co-workers--
15865	3	a	take heed of . 
15866	1	a	hee-heeding this right now . 
15867	3	a	okay . this city . dwight . we are not mad , we are just disappointed . 
15868	3	a	yes . we are . we are livid . but we are going to let this one slide . 
15869	3	a	i am not a mind reader , david . 
15870	3	a	can you shove down ? instead . . . shove down , please . instead , what i think we should do is strip of your title as safety officer . 
15871	1	a	no . 
15872	3	a	and we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice . something that dwight doesn't like . 
15873	1	a	peta . 
15874	3	a	do you ? 
15875	3	a	you talking to me ? 
15876	3	a	what ? 
15877	1	a	well . . . i guess we papered over that pretty nicely . it always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise . what's the matter ? you hungry ? 
15878	3	a	 no , dwight . i am worried . a man's life is in my hands . 
15879	1	a	don't you worry about that . i got it covered . okay ? 
15880	3	a	yeah . 
15881	1	a	i am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping . 
15882	3	a	that's not gonna happen . i'm taking over as safety man . 
15883	1	a	what ? you ? 
15884	3	a	yes . 
15885	1	a	come on . 
15886	3	a	i'm a smart guy . i'll figure it out . 
15887	1	a	that's preposterous . 
15888	3	a	no , i will . 
15889	3	a	nobody should have to go to work thinking , 'oh , this is the place that i might die today . ' that's what a hospital is for . an office is for not dying . an office is a place to live life to the fullest , to the max , to . . . an office is a place where dreams come true . 
15890	3	a	shhh ! don't excite him . don't make him excitable . welcome back , stanley . 
15891	3	a	andy . 
15892	0	a	 a throne for your highness . 
15893	3	a	no , no , no . no debate . you are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet . 
15894	3	a	okay , you know what ? that could be a little confusing , because in sales a-b-c means 'always be closing . '
15895	1	a	this is a farce . i should be teaching this course . 
15896	3	a	shut it . shut it . 
15897	1	a	absolutely i would not . 
15898	3	a	you know who i really think should go ? stanley . 
15899	3	a	come on . 
15900	3	a	no rest for the sick . we are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working . what are you gonna do if you're by yourself and your heart stops ? 
15901	3	a	and you're okay with that ? 
15902	3	a	uh-uh . no , no , no . come on . get up . let's do this . 
15903	3	a	come on stanley . you're losing you . you're losing you . do it ! 
15904	3	a	this is you we're talking about . 
15905	3	a	okay , okay . i'll show them . here we go . stanley . all right . 
15906	3	a	no , rose . they are not breathing . and they have no arms or legs . 
15907	3	a	where are they ? you know what ? if we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them ? i mean , what kind of quality of life do we have there ? 
15908	3	a	how about no arms ? no arms or legs is basically how you exist right now , kevin . you don't do anything . 
15909	3	a	okay , that's uh , hard to keep track . how many is that per hour ? 
15910	2	a	how's that gonna help you ? 
15911	3	a	i will divide and then count to it . 
15912	2	a	right . 
15913	3	a	yes , yes i do . i love that song . first i was afraid , i was petrified .

15933	1	a	wow . 
15934	3	a	okay , look . david , this is why we have training . we start with the dummy , and we learn from our mistakes . and now dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person . 
15935	0	a	hope you brought your appetitos . my lady . my tuna . a little movie popcorn . uh , damn it . this movie , a lot of buzz . not coming out for another six months . mrs . albert hannaday . so , friendship with the nard-dog has its privileges . 
15936	4	a	we don't normally download films illegally . because we're honest , hardworking people . 
15937	2	a	and we don't know how . 
15938	4	a	but andy does , so we have to watch it with him . 
15939	2	a	punishment fits the crime . 
15940	2	a	 what's going on ? 
15941	2	a	uh , no one really knows , but pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage . 
15942	4	a	my dad spent the night at our place last night . my parents have been fighting for weeks and . . . it kinda sucks . jim's been great . but i'm gonna need to buy my dad a robe .

15944	0	a	hmm ? who ? sam ? 
15945	4	a	yeah . 
15946	2	a	i mean , they just need to communicate , you know ? if they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else , then--
15947	0	a	hmm .

15949	3	a	hi , everyone . corporate has given dwight two strikes . they are very , very upset with him . so , as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology . dwight , have you prepared your statement of regret ? 
15950	1	a	i have . 
15951	3	a	let's hear it . 
15952	1	a	 'i state my regret . '
15953	2	a	you couldn't of memorized that ? 
15954	1	a	i could not , because i do not feel it . okay , everyone . i am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it . okay ? everyone come on up here . it's not a big deal . 
15955	1	a	yeah , right . i filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise . now , take a lesson from stanley and jog on up here and sign this , okay ? make a line . just form a line right here . sign it ! sign it now !

16103	2	a	 just , easy . 
16104	1	a	 . . . there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee . she becomes too powerful , so he appointed two heads .

16336	2	a	look , is there a birthday you remember that you loved ?

16338	2	a	okay , stop . forever stop that story . that's disgusting , and it doesn't count . so give me another one . 
16339	1	a	schrutes don't celebrate birthdays , idiot . it started as a depression-era practicality , and then moved on to an awesome tradition that i look forward to every year . what about you ? 
16340	2	a	actually , when i was seven , my dad took me to the natural history museum in new york . and we looked at fossils all day . and at the end of the day , he got me a little plastic triceratops . it was awesome . 
16341	1	a	that's cool . hey , you know what's even cooler than triceratops ? every other dinosaur that ever existed . 
16342	2	a	 didn't see that one coming . 
16343	4	a	 it's deleted .

16607	4	a	good morning , mr . wonka , here are your messages . 
16608	3	a	why thank you very much . oh , what are those ? what are those ? tell me , please ! 
16609	4	a	jelly beans . 
16610	3	a	no , no , no . they are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl . these are extraordinary jelly beans ! 
16611	3	a	i've written these things because it is my responsibility , as manager of this branch , to profiligate great ideas and i think i have done my part with the golden ticket promotion . now it is your turn . i want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine . umm hmm . 
16612	2	a	we own our own delivery trucks . we could lease them out on the weekends --
16613	3	a	too many words . good ideas are simple . 'golden ticket . '
16614	2	a	free paper . '
16615	3	a	no . jim . we're a business . post-its . that is a golden ticket idea . nasa took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon . 
16616	0	a	golden girls . that's a golden ticket idea , right , i mean how great was that show ? golden grahams . another , is it -- i don't get this . . . 
16617	3	a	no , you don't . no , it - what will be the state of this company if i am the only one coming up with the great ideas ? right ? 
16618	0	a	no ! no ! no ! 
16619	0	a	 you're making it too easy for her . you're just conveying , 'oh i like you just the way you are . '
16620	0	a	well that's not what we agreed on . 
16621	2	a	what are you doing ? 
16622	0	a	huh ? 
16623	2	a	 why don't you just go out on a date with her ? try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two , if it feels right , you'll know . 
16624	0	a	no . 
16625	4	a	you don't have to wait that long . i mean , you don't have to wait a month to ask her out . just ask her out . 
16626	0	a	you're asking him to give up all of his power . 
16627	2	a	what power ? 
16628	0	a	you can't let a girl feel good about herself . it will backfire on you . every compliment has to be backhanded . 'oh i like your dress , but i'd like it more if you had prettier hair . '
16629	4	a	that's psychotic . do guys actually do that ? 
16630	2	a	well guys with girlfriends don't . 
16631	0	a	that's low , tuna . 
16632	2	a	 hey , tom . what's that ? oh , you found a golden ticket . one of my clients found a golden ticket . yup . no , congratulations . 
16633	3	a	woo hoo . 
16634	2	a	 i'll take that down right now . 
16635	3	a	tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips . . . 
16636	2	a	i'm on the phone . 
16637	3	a	 . . . or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession ? 
16638	2	a	 hold on one second . 
16639	3	a	invite them on the tour . 
16640	2	a	 it's actually blue cross from pennsylvania . 
16641	3	a	really ? that's kind of a big client . hey , oscar . woo hoo hoo . um , how much of a hit is ten percent of our blue cross account ? 
16642	3	a	yeah ? 
16643	3	a	yeah . 
16644	2	a	 hold on one sec . hold on one sec , tom , what's that ? you found five golden tickets ? and does it say limit one per customer ? nope , it doesn't . 
16645	2	a	how do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments ? 
16646	3	a	i thought i did . so . . . 
16647	2	a	ok . . . 
16648	3	a	well no harm no foul . 
16649	2	a	 . . . well i'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know i didn't lose half my sales . 
16650	3	a	you didn't , but . . . it'll be fine . it'll be good . 
16651	3	a	hey . hey . hey . you idiot . 
16652	3	a	sir . i placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with blue cross . how does this happen ? 
16653	3	a	irrelevant . 
16654	3	a	ok , i'm going to ask you something and i want you to be honest . what is a pallet ? 
16655	3	a	my golden ticket idea ? ok . why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea ? there is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea . that . . . 
16656	4	a	dunder mifflin , this is pam . oh hi , david . no , i'm sorry he's not back from the civil rights rally . i'll have him call you the minute he gets back from the lincoln memorial . 
16657	4	a	when michael's skirting a phone call , he gave me a list of places to say he is . 'stopping a fight in the parking lot . ' 'an obama fashion show . ' whatever . . . that is . or 'trapped in an oil painting . ' i'm gonna save that one . 
16658	3	a	nobody panic . the good news is . . . they can't fire all of us , right ? 
16659	3	a	no , they can't . 
16660	3	a	oscar , you don't know what the hell you are talking about . 
16661	3	a	alright , then we're screwed . i am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy , so -
16662	2	a	so , well i lost a ton of money today and i have a mortgage , so i'm a little pissed too . 
16663	3	a	thank you , jim is with me . 
16664	2	a	absolutely not , i'm mad at you . 
16665	3	a	well you know what jim ? it is not my fault that you bought a house to impress pam . that is why carnations exist . 
16666	3	a	ok , we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess . yes . 
16667	4	a	does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later ? 
16668	2	a	good one . 
16669	3	a	ok , don't get that . please ? 
16670	3	a	that is not constructive . 
16671	4	a	 dunder mifflin , this is pam . oh hi , david . he's having a colonoscopy . alright , i'll find out if he's out yet . 
16672	3	a	 hello david . i just got back from my procedure , so--
16673	3	a	how are you doing ? 
16674	3	a	 my colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera . 
16675	3	a	well , there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and i just don't . . . i don't know . 
16676	3	a	i think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant . 
16677	3	a	you're breaking up . 
16678	3	a	ok , i think , it might have been an inside consultant . 
16679	3	a	yes . 
16680	3	a	no . 
16681	3	a	 yes . 
16682	3	a	 come on in . good to see ya , have a seat . i just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea . 
16683	1	a	that was your idea . 
16684	3	a	woah , wow , who told you that ? 
16685	1	a	you did . several times . over and over again . 
16686	3	a	 no , i don't think i ever did . that was your idea dwight . 
16687	1	a	 you were dressed as willy wonka so . . . 
16688	3	a	i'm not taking . . . i'm not taking . . . 
16689	1	a	wasn't my idea . loved - but i can't . 
16690	3	a	wait a second , wait a second , i wrote it down in my diary . 
16691	1	a	you don't keep a diary . 
16692	3	a	yes i do . you've just never seen it . march 4th . dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets . 
16693	1	a	hold that thought . march . . . 4th . michael scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year . 
16694	3	a	why do you have a diary ? 
16695	1	a	to keep secrets from my computer . 
16696	3	a	ok , you know what ? you came up with this idea . i remember you told me that you loved the willy wonka movie when you were growing up . 
16697	1	a	impossible . 
16698	3	a	yes , you did . 
16699	1	a	i wasn't given candy as a child , so a movie that fetish-ized it that much , would have made no sense to me . plus , we weren't allowed to see movies . so . . . do the math . 
16700	3	a	what are you writing ? 
16701	1	a	had conversation with michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine . discussed movies . 
16702	3	a	would you like to go to lunch with me ? just the two of us ? 
16703	1	a	with all my heart . 
16704	2	a	all i'm saying is that it's a first dates , so just keep a respectful distance . 
16705	4	a	i don't think jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her . 
16706	2	a	no , that is what i mean . 
16707	4	a	 shush . kevin , a playful touch on the arm , or on the back , it can show your interest and it's really romantic . 
16708	2	a	no , stop it . 
16709	0	a	don't touch her . don't talk to her . don't look at her . 
16710	0	a	 . . . turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that . 
16711	3	a	we think a lot alike . sometimes you will think something and i will say what you're thinking--
16712	1	a	ok , what am i thinking right now ? 
16713	3	a	umm , nacho chips . 
16714	1	a	no . . . how skin is the largest organ of the body . 
16715	3	a	oh , ok . let me just cut to the chase , dwight . i want you to fall on your sword for me . 
16716	1	a	oh , not gonna happen . 
16717	1	a	i did fall on my sword once . i was running with it in my belt . won't happen again . 
16718	1	a	what about shoe la la ? 
16719	3	a	 it's not ready yet . 
16720	3	a	i have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called shoe la la . and it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life , like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby , or for just lounging around the house . 
16721	3	a	may i have your attention please . i have an announcement . mr . dwight schrute and i just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although i probably will never do it again , i had fun . i really had fun with my best friend , dwight . 
16722	3	a	yes they are , you just don't care about the information . 
16723	1	a	i love working here and i do not want to leave . 
16724	3	a	he doesn't love it that much . wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired . 
16725	1	a	well . . . 
16726	3	a	i mean , like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion . . . 
16727	1	a	we discussed the fact that i'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world . 
16728	3	a	right . 
16729	1	a	no plowing my own acres . going around shirtless all day . you know experiencing freedom . 
16730	3	a	that's it . that's it . you can't put a price on freedom . 
16731	1	a	try me . 
16732	3	a	that's why you made the decision . that's why you made . . . 
16733	1	a	i haven't made a decision yet . 
16734	3	a	you kind of have . 
16735	1	a	no . 
16736	3	a	yes . 
16737	2	a	you cannot take the fall for him . 
16738	1	a	he said he would do the same for me . 
16739	2	a	he can do the same for you . right now . by getting fired instead of you . so what are you gonna do ? 
16740	1	a	i'm gonna go back to work . after i write you up for insubordination . 
16741	2	a	there it is . 
16742	3	a	yes it is , but it had to be done , didn't it ? 
16743	1	a	david . . . you're welcome . 
16744	1	a	that's what she said ! 
16745	3	a	hey , dwight , great idea . dwight , dwight , great idea . how'd you come up with that idea ? 
16746	1	a	inspiration . 
16747	3	a	really ? how did-- how are you inspired ? how did it pop into your head dwight ? 
16748	1	a	 you never know when it's gonna strike . just . . . boom . 
16749	3	a	give me the details of how that happened . 
16750	2	a	you , you are taking about dwight schrute . the biggest wonka fan i know . i mean , you've been talking about that movie for years . 
16751	3	a	what ? 
16752	2	a	and you know what ? i even made fun of you when you dressed up as willy wonka to pitch this idea and for that i apologize . 
16753	1	a	apology rejected . 
16754	4	a	 thanks for much for helping the company , dwight . 
16755	1	a	oh pam . 
16756	1	a	thanks old man . 
16757	1	a	yeah . 
16758	4	a	sure . 
16759	3	a	david ? david ? 
16760	1	a	 'cause i've got this idea . . . 
16761	3	a	david ? 
16762	3	a	could i be a part of the meeting also ? 
16763	2	a	yeah , let's face it . this meeting sounds like it's wonka fans only . he's never seen the movie . 
16764	1	a	alright . 
16765	1	a	ok guys , listen up . here's the deal . i love candy . sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids , so naturally i liked willy wonka . 
16766	1	a	so i love willy wonka . that golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where i cam up with that idea . 
16767	3	a	there is no movie called willy wonka . it's called willy wonka and the chocolate factory . 
16768	4	a	it's actually based on a book called charlie and the chocolate factory . 
16769	1	a	pam . . . 
16770	3	a	i can't . . . vouch for that . but i do know this . he is a liar . he has taken my idea . 
16771	1	a	that is my idea . 
16772	3	a	ok , here's what happened , david . it was all my idea . you called me and you were really angry at me and i got scared , so i had dwight take the fall , but now , it turns out that it's a great idea and dwight will not confess . can you believe that ? 
16773	1	a	it is my idea . 
16774	3	a	oh how dare you . 
16775	1	a	it is my idea . i'm filled with good ideas . thousands of good ideas . 
16776	3	a	you are ? good ideas , huh ? hey , did you come up with toilet buddy ? it's a net , circular net , that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet ? formally known as toilet guard ? 
16777	1	a	horse boat . 
16778	3	a	oh please . 
16779	1	a	a canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down . horse boat ! 
16780	3	a	toilet sponge . it's a hollowed out sponge . . . 
16781	1	a	oh give me a break . 
16782	3	a	 . . . that is more absorbent , and softer than toilet paper . i have a lot of toilet ideas . 
16783	1	a	that's because they're easy ! 
16784	3	a	they're not easy . everybody has to go to the bathroom . 
16785	1	a	 women's urinals . . . uh . . . 
16786	1	a	yes , it's michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death . 
16787	3	a	thank you ! 
16788	3	a	well david , i will be honest with you . i do want the credit without any of the blame . 
16789	4	a	ok . 
16790	3	a	when they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that i had a good idea . and that's what i am going to write down in my diary . that is what i want you to write down in yours . 
16791	1	a	oh i am . in my own words . 
16792	3	a	i want to see it . 
16793	1	a	no .

16795	1	a	no , michael . 
16796	3	a	give me . . . give me the diary . 
16797	1	a	no ! 
16798	0	a	well , it's uh , his funeral . so . . . neh !

16812	2	a	alright . 
16813	1	a	michael , since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company , i thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause . 
16814	3	a	i like it . 
16815	1	a	followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence . 
16816	2	a	 i don't know . is it classy enough ? 
16817	1	a	jim ! enough with the classy , ok ? 
16818	2	a	i just feel like after fifteen years at this company , bravo by the way , that we should celebrate with a very classy event , a night to remember . 
16819	3	a	i think you're right . this party has to have all the excitement , drama and intrigue of my time here . 
16820	2	a	and of course , classy . 
16821	3	a	and classy , yeah . 
16822	1	a	michael , you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux . don't you see what he's doing here ? 
16823	2	a	last week , dwight sent out a memo about the dress code . so , this is me showing him that i'm taking it very seriously . 
16824	1	a	oh , here's one: a string quartet , playing classy-cal music . 
16825	3	a	 you know , that's good but it's not classy . i-i need something classy like the opening of a car dealership . 
16826	2	a	that's it . or mr . peanut . 
16827	3	a	yes . 
16828	1	a	mr . peanut is not classy . 
16829	3	a	he is . 
16830	1	a	he is a regular peanut . he just happens to have a cane , a monocle and a top hat . 
16831	3	a	that's what makes him classy . 
16832	1	a	ok , how about this ? an ice sculpture , shaped like you , covered in chocolate-covered strawberries . 
16833	2	a	oh , dwight , you're trying too hard , and that's just not classy . you see , the thing about classy is it's a state of mind . 
16834	1	a	well , i'm sorry , i just don't know what classy is then . 
16835	2	a	ok , well let's just try this one on for size . and i apologize because it's right off the top of my head: an ice sculpture . of you . completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits . 
16836	3	a	strawberries ? 
16837	2	a	that's inspired . 
16838	1	a	i said that ! 
16839	4	a	not classy . 
16840	3	a	not classy at all . 
16841	2	a	de class' . 
16842	3	a	french . classy . 
16843	4	a	hi , can i help you ? 
16844	4	a	sure . just one second . please have a seat . 
16845	3	a	 yes ? 
16846	4	a	michael , there's a charles miner here to see you . 
16847	3	a	miner ? i hardly know her ! . . . hello ? 
16848	4	a	yeah , are you coming out now ? 
16849	3	a	wow ! hold that thought . i want everybody to go into the break room . i have a little surprise for you . go ahead . you too . dwight , would you escort our guest in there ? c'mon , here we go , don't be shy , don't be shy , you're one of us . dwight , stall him a little , i have to get the fish . 
16850	2	a	hey . 
16851	3	a	yes . 
16852	2	a	really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today . 
16853	3	a	what ? no , i didn't want to make everybody nervous . 
16854	2	a	nope . i mean , i could have brought a change of clothes , or-
16855	3	a	you look dynamite . what are you talking about ? very slick . ok , get the fish . 
16856	1	a	originally founded in 1866 , scranton quickly became one of pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal-mining communities . 
16857	3	a	surprise , there is nothing in here . the real surprise is in the conference room . let's go ! oh ! god ! ok , come on , come on ! 
16858	1	a	we'll finish it up later , but essentially what we're talking about is . . . 
16859	3	a	surprise ! as you can see , i turned the bagels from o's into c's , for charles . 
16860	3	a	took me all night . 
16861	4	a	this is what you did last night ? 
16862	2	a	hey , how you doing ? jim halpert , sales . just wanted to say , if you need anything , let me know . 
16863	2	a	i didn't think you'd notice . uh , it's funny actually , there's another salesman out here , dwight schrute , and he sent out this memo , as he always does , and , uh , it was about professionalism in the workplace . of course , he singled me out . so i just had to mess with him . 
16864	2	a	oh , you'd understand if you read the memo which i should probably get you , there's probably one in a drawer . . . uh . it was pretty crazy . but , uh , not more crazy than wearing a tux , at work , i grant you that . . . so , uh . 
16865	2	a	jim halpert , yep . so , um , just going to let you get back to it . . . 
16866	4	a	he just had to wear his tux today . 
16867	2	a	i thought it'd be funny . 
16868	4	a	took him 40 minutes to get ready . 
16869	3	a	all right , let me introduce you to some of the troops . accounting , front and center . come on up here . i'd like you to meet somebody . this is the accounting department . 
16870	3	a	oh , nerd alert ! 
16871	3	a	this is oscar martinez . he is latino . and he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man , gil , who broke his heart . but he didn't bring any of that into work , it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and i am very proud of him for that . 
16872	3	a	this little hell-raiser is angela . she has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office . one over there , in the orange 
16873	0	a	hey-o ! 
16874	3	a	there you go ! where's the other ? 
16875	3	a	well , perfect , because we have now arrived at kevin and he has no sexual history . 
16876	3	a	good . good , good , good . everyone , please give it up for charles miner . 
16877	3	a	oh ! well . . . 
16878	3	a	above and beyond . 
16879	3	a	that's true . 
16880	3	a	no . absolutely not . 
16881	3	a	well , due to the economy , there is a lot of worry going around . i didn't want to worry people . 
16882	3	a	well , why don't-
16883	3	a	charles is going to tell you . 
16884	3	a	well , it's not official . 
16885	3	a	such as salary , benefits , etc , etc . insurance . 
16886	3	a	well-
16887	1	a	what about your party ? 
16888	3	a	ok , ok , you know what ? i think this has been great . i think this gives us a lot to think about , doesn't it ? charles miner , ladies and gentlemen . he has a long trip home . thank you for coming in . we have to get back to work . 
16889	3	a	oh no , no , no . you don't have to do that . i've got this covered . this was just a meet-and-greet . 
16890	3	a	i am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that i'm supposed to have . thrilled . 
16891	3	a	 david , it was my understanding that i was not going to be managed . 
16892	3	a	it was my understanding . 
16893	3	a	listen , why don't we just leave that position vacant ? truth be told , i think i thrive under a lack of accountability . 
16894	3	a	but the branch is still mine ? 
16895	1	a	ask him about the party . 
16896	3	a	oh , right . david , are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party ? 
16897	1	a	no the other thing . 
16898	3	a	oh , ok . if we hire cirque de soleil as salaried employees , will that help us with year-end tax stuff ? 
16899	1	a	he hung up ? 
16900	3	a	i just got off the horn with david wallace , and he said that you and i should try to get to know each other better . and i agree , so what i would like you to do is tell me something that you've never told anybody before . 
16901	3	a	come on . what's your wife's name ? where did you work before you came here ? 
16902	3	a	beautiful . see , african-americans have such a rich history of unusual names . 
16903	3	a	you're not from paper ? 
16904	3	a	does david know this ? 
16905	3	a	well that , actually , is an excellent segue into really what is my only point-
16906	3	a	and that- i-i don't need to be managed , charles . and if you want pick up some tips , observing here , and take them to the other branches , it's all good . but jan would mostly come by when she was super horny , and ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry , so . . . are we clear ? 
16907	3	a	ok , alright , well i'll just bounce that off david , see what comes back . 
16908	3	a	whatever david wants . 
16909	3	a	 michael scott calling for david . well , just tell him to call me asap as possible . thanks . 
16910	1	a	oh , michael , come on , no . you have to charm 'em . 
16911	1	a	hey there , gorgeous . how you doing today ? 
16912	1	a	how's it hanging ? 
16913	1	a	good . listen , my name is , uh , michael . . . scotch . and , uh , i just wanted to say that , uh , i've got david wallace's son in the trunk of my car . if he doesn't get on this phone in 5 seconds-
16914	3	a	no ! you idiot ! idiot , idiot , idiot ! what are you doing ? god ! oh my god . 
16915	3	a	hi stephanie , it's michael scott again . i just spoke with michael scotch and the son's going to be returned , everything's fine . 
16916	3	a	and i really really need to talk to david . 
16917	3	a	i was never given a name . 
16918	4	a	 uh , hi , can i help you ? i don't think anyone here-
16919	3	a	are you kidding me with this ? on the day that i bring in breakfast ? 
16920	3	a	i wish you had told us sooner , because i was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad . 
16921	3	a	nobody thanked me . 
16922	2	a	thanks , charles . 
16923	3	a	for breakfast . except charles . you say no more parties , and then you spend all of this money on lunch , i think it's a little hypercritical . 
16924	3	a	 damn it , stephanie , put me through to him . is that him in the background ? david ? david ! david , pick up the phone ! 
16925	3	a	yep . 
16926	3	a	do some overtime ? you want to do some overtime this weekend ? you know what , kevin , i applaud your initiative . yes . you may . 
16927	3	a	kevin ? this is my branch . you don't ask charles . you ask me . i say , approved . 
16928	3	a	yes it is ! 
16929	3	a	no , it is not . 
16930	3	a	ok , so we're on the same page , great . 
16931	3	a	ok , michael , what are you doing ? 
16932	3	a	no , seriously . 
16933	3	a	how old are you ? 
16934	4	a	oh no . 
16935	4	a	i can tell michael's mood by which comedy routine he chooses to do , the more infantile , the more upset he is . and he just skipped the ace ventura talking butt thing . he never skips it . this is bad . 
16936	3	a	five years old ? 
16937	0	a	duuudes , stop . 
16938	3	a	i'm gonna walk away . 
16939	0	a	stop doing that ! 
16940	3	a	i'm kidding around , wow ! relax , everybody , it's just a joke . it's fine . boy , so touchy . ppc , let's continue our morning meeting in the conference room . 
16941	4	a	and then , out of that cake , pops another stripper holding a smaller cake . and then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one . 
16942	3	a	what is that smaller stripper holding ? 
16943	4	a	cupcake . it's cupcakes and strippers all the way down . 
16944	3	a	ok . 
16945	3	a	party planning committee . not your concern , charles . 
16946	3	a	really ? well then how would we come up with great ideas like jim's ? go ahead . 
16947	2	a	no , i would like to get back to work , actually , please . 
16948	2	a	you pet the animals and they pet you back . 
16949	3	a	it's a great idea . and we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay . 
16950	4	a	it's really just a regular shaped cake . 
16951	3	a	but it's cool , and it's-
16952	3	a	whoa . you're talking about my anniversary party , so . . . 
16953	3	a	yeah , why don't you do that ? 
16954	3	a	yeah , here we go . ok . 
16955	3	a	what ? 
16956	3	a	newsflash: i've been here for fifteen years . headline: you have been here one day . end of story . you have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party . end of story . end of story . end of story ! 
16957	2	a	hey . 
16958	2	a	alright , charles , i've gotta be honest . i think we really got off on the wrong foot here . and , truth be told , i'm a pretty smart guy , and , uh , a hard-worker . and a great number two for the office . 
16959	2	a	second-in-command to michael . 
16960	2	a	oh , that's because at first it was a made up position for dwight , just to make him feel better , assistant to the regional manager . but then he lost that , and michael gave it to me . 
16961	2	a	assistant regional manager , yeah . 
16962	2	a	no , not exactly . 
16963	2	a	alright , i will , um , i'm just gonna let you get back to that . 
16964	2	a	yep . 
16965	3	a	hello , stephanie . ok , where is he ? 
16966	3	a	 so is this the meeting you've been in all day ? 
16967	3	a	i drove . 
16968	3	a	cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party . just pulled the rug out from under me . and he said no figs . i've already bought em . and i don't have a place to store them . so , i feel like i've been sort of boned . 
16969	3	a	do you talk to him about this ? you've talked to him all day , obviously . did you talk to him about this ? 
16970	3	a	ok . then i don't get it . it doesn't make any sense to me . because i thought in the new system i was supposed to talk to charles , and then charles was supposed to talk to you , and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again . 
16971	3	a	clearly that's what you wanted . 
16972	3	a	fifteen years i have been here . and i have sacrificed a lot . 
16973	3	a	i've put having a family on hold . 
16974	3	a	and i've never gone hang-gliding . and i've never driven my car to the top of mount washington . 
16975	0	a	cool . 
16976	1	a	excellent . 
16977	2	a	see ya . see ya . bye ! 
16978	2	a	and for my next trick , i will make my career disappear . 
16979	3	a	i don't understand that after fifteen years of service here , i have to get in the car and drive to new york in order to talk to you . that doesn't seem right to me . that doesn't seem fair . and i think that i've earned more than that . 
16980	3	a	ok . 
16981	3	a	 i quit . 
16982	3	a	you have no idea how high i can fly . 
16983	0	a	i'm telling you , when corporate sends somebody , it is big trouble , or , really good news . and then sometimes it means business as usual . 
16984	0	a	why are you asking him ? i just told you why he's here . 
16985	3	a	i had no idea when i got in that car and headed to new york i was going to quit . i got on that ramp and i thought two hours , two hours to go . feeling good . listen to some tunes . should've peed before i left . 
16986	3	a	okay , so . i get up to the building , i get to the revolving door . . . broken ! so i have to take the normal door . 
16987	3	a	no , no ! i was so nervous it was the wrong building ! i walked into the wrong building ! 
16988	4	a	he finally has a story everyone wants to hear . . . and he knows it . 
16989	4	a	okay focus . focus . you're in the right building , you're with the right people; what happened ? 
16990	3	a	i looked at wallace and i said 'i quit ! ' and as i turned to leave i looked back and i said 'you have no idea how high i can fly . '
16991	3	a	why would i do that ? 
16992	3	a	you guys have thought about this a lot more than i have . i just winged it . 
16993	2	a	 about a week ago , michael gave his 2-week notice . and , surprisingly there is a very big difference between michael trying and michael not trying . 
16994	3	a	scotch with splenda . tastes like splenda , gets you drunk like scotch . clinky , clinky-clink . come-on . . . come on , come on . 
16995	3	a	 what am i gonna do ? i'll tell ya what i'm gonna do . i gonna do a little bit of this , a little bit of that . i gonna stay up all day . gonna sleep it up all night . i'm gonna give it a ohh ! hey ! ho ! and i'm going to stop worrying about calories . 
16996	3	a	i have a job . 
16997	0	a	for four more days . 
16998	4	a	do you have any leads on a job ? 
16999	3	a	pam , what you don't understand is that at my level you just don't look in the want-ads for a job . you are head-hunted . 
17000	2	a	you called any headhunters ? 
17001	3	a	any good headhunter knows i am available . 
17002	1	a	any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife , 
17003	2	a	right , cause that's what we are talking about . 
17004	3	a	you're 'i need you to' is my command . 
17005	0	a	hey michael . . . 
17006	3	a	hey .

17008	3	a	you can talk to me for as long as you want . i have all the time in the world . oh god ! blech ! phyllis ! 
17009	0	a	i just wanted to tell you that . . . oh what ? what's that ? 
17010	3	a	oh ! hey . what is this about ? 
17011	0	a	um , you know , cause your leaving and so , it's a farewell . . . 
17012	3	a	oh .

17015	0	a	ah . . . busted . yes

17240	4	a	hey ! we need to get you dressed !

17242	3	a	alright . 
17243	0	a	oh . oh my god . i'm so embarrassed . you weren't supposed to see this . this is like my secret obsession .

17325	4	a	 nana ? 
17326	3	a	people turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my nana's investment club can help the michael scott paper company become a reality , then i'm sure that's what she would have wanted . does want . 
17327	3	a	okay . i have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry . with a lean , mean fighting crew and low overhead , i think i can perform the same business at a much , much higher rate of profit . 
17328	3	a	by wanting it more . by working hard-
17329	3	a	mmmm-my mission is stated as follows: i will not be beat . i will never give up . i am on a mission . that is the michael scott guarantee .

17336	3	a	and i offer same day , free delivery . 
17337	3	a	nana . i really think that papa would want you to do this . 
17338	3	a	well what is it exactly ? i mean , what , what specifically ? we don't - it doesn't have to be paper . we could sell medicine and other . . . 
17339	3	a	well . . . this might not be the right time , but i need more than i originally asked for . 
17340	3	a	okay . 
17341	3	a	okay .

17346	2	a	okay , i'm just gonna go get some ice . 
17347	2	a	i'm sorry , phyllis . 
17348	3	a	yeah . i have cable and satellite as a backup . yeah , i know . two not-so-great things in a row . ehhhh , well . stuff happens , right ? at least we got ryan . the rye-guy . we should call him rye bread . we don't have to call him that . unless you like it . we could call him that . 
17349	4	a	i can't do this . 
17350	3	a	what's that ? 
17351	4	a	i can't do this . i had a real job . i sat ten feet away from my fiance . i had health benefits . i was just feeling impulsive . i should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle . 
17352	3	a	blech . 
17353	4	a	i just keep getting bored . and i let things build up and build up and then i - i , i do something too big , like this . who does this ? 
17354	3	a	well you know what ? my mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world . and that's why god made so many . 
17355	4	a	we don't have any money . we don't have an office . we don't have anything . 
17356	3	a	well we should make a list . lists are good . lists are good . lists are good . first on the list , let's get you out of the car . alright . okay . . . 
17357	4	a	how come out of everyone in the office , i'm the only one that went with you ? is it because i'm that stupid ? i mean , your own grandmother doesn't even believe in you ! 
17358	3	a	i want you to listen to me . because i want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now , kay ? you quit your job . i quit my job . we both quit . those are the facts . that's what happened . now , what are our choices right now ? because you know , kiddo , you quit . 
17359	4	a	yeah . 
17360	3	a	you gotta have some extra space . philly , work with me here . there's gotta be some sort of secret office that you have . . . lurkin' around . . . some awesome , free , keep it off the books . . . oh , no . not there . that would be humiliating . 
17361	3	a	i did what i had to do . i stepped in . i took charge . that's what being a man is . and earlier today , i was freaking out . pam stepped up . she was the man . don't think a woman can be a man ? well , then that's your stereotype , not mine . 
17362	3	a	 okay . 
17363	4	a	i could work here . i could see this . 
17364	3	a	it's right in the middle of the paper belt . 
17365	4	a	are you good ? 
17366	3	a	yeah , i'm good . you good ? 
17367	4	a	i'm good . 
17368	3	a	you know what they say , keep your friends close . 
17369	3	a	yes , i am , charles . 
17370	3	a	it's britney bitch . and i am back , in the form of a new company . the michael scott paper company . okay . not gonna make this one . 
17371	2	a	love the hair . 
17372	4	a	morning michael ! 
17373	3	a	hello ! they took away my parking space but they can't take away my pride ! 
17374	3	a	i would like to invite you all to come away with me , on a journey . welcome ! to the michael scott paper company ! 
17375	2	a	you realize you're not actually talking to me , right ? 
17376	2	a	the new receptionist is also named kelly . so kelly kapoor has decided to hover around my desk , so that she can run into his charles' office every time he calls for kelly . she thinks if she says 'you wanted me' enough , he will in fact want her . it's not the worse plan she's ever had . 
17377	3	a	we are in the heart of it . and the surge of water carries our business out to the sea . 
17378	4	a	what should we do now ? 
17379	3	a	we wait , and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon . 
17380	3	a	i am going to need 800 of these , on nice bright paper . it is a coupon for unparalleled customer service . 
17381	4	a	i make that one copy , and i become the girl who makes copies , and by the end of the day i'm receptionist again . and the worst part is , i like making copies . the paper comes out all warm and stuff . and it's cold in there . cause it's technically a closet . 
17382	0	a	what do you think ?

17441	4	a	definitely . 
17442	3	a	okay . there are . . . 4 corners in this room . each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you . whichever corner you want . and make it your own .

17534	3	a	hup ! 
17535	4	a	we're getting pretty good at it . 
17536	2	a	andy put down a bunch of deposits on stuff for his wedding with angela , but then she was sleeping with dwight for . . . several years . wait , no , that can't be right . 
17537	4	a	the timeline's messy .

17539	0	a	this is my solo . 
17540	4	a	i'm confused . am i walking down the aisle to 'you can call me al ? '
17541	0	a	trust me . you will not be walking . you will be boogie-ing . 
17542	2	a	i am extremely interested . so , how much will all of this cost ? 
17543	0	a	well , 12 guys , airfare , three nights in a hotel , food per diem , table up front for merch . . . $9 , 000 . 
17544	4	a	i don't know . it seems like a lot for an a cappella group from a college we never went to . 
17545	0	a	did you even hear the music i just played for you ? 
17546	4	a	mm-hmm . 
17547	1	a	these sleeves are cutting off my circulation . not enough blood getting to my hands . 
17548	1	a	doesn't charles know he's compromising my attack readiness ? it's not a dress code . it's a death sentence . 
17549	1	a	kay , thank you . it's a straight jacket ! okay . 
17550	1	a	when michael was in charge , this place was like the roman empire . and the wild west . and war-torn poland . and poland . there was just a lot going on , so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries . and in that chaos , i soared . 
17551	3	a	hey . 
17552	1	a	hey . ed's tires is thinking of making a change . 
17553	3	a	 is this good ? 
17554	1	a	they have some great kitchen ideas . 
17555	3	a	oh . okay . ed's tires , huh ? 
17556	1	a	it's small , i know . 
17557	3	a	i really appreciate it . 
17558	1	a	thanks , michael . wait , what is this ? 
17559	3	a	it's for your trouble . 
17560	1	a	wh- i don't need $6 to help a friend . 
17561	3	a	no , no , listen , as a friend , i want you to have this . 
17562	1	a	michael , you know i can't take this . 
17563	3	a	yes , i do . 
17564	1	a	but don't forget you owe me $10 . 
17565	3	a	that was four years ago . why don't you let it go ? 
17566	1	a	michael . 
17567	0	a	what was up with pam being all pushy and negative in there ? 
17568	2	a	i think she just didn't want a crucifix cake . 
17569	0	a	it scares me to see you going down a road that i went down . 
17570	2	a	am i going down a road ? 
17571	0	a	when i see her bossing you around like that , it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance . 
17572	2	a	it's so scary how right the things you're saying are . and you're coming at it with almost no knowledge , so of course i trust your opinion on this . 
17573	0	a	i know a few things about love . horrible , terrible , awful , awful things . 
17574	2	a	i was going to use today to purge my inbox , but now something much more pressing has come up . 
17575	3	a	ed's tires . why don't you tell them that we have fewer clients , so we can spend more time with each of them . also , try to discuss it over indian food , and try to mention how you distrust women . 
17576	4	a	i'm not gonna do that . 
17577	3	a	that is smart . that would not seem genuine . ryan ? 
17578	3	a	good , you take the lead on this one . also , do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce . 
17579	3	a	bring it in . morning cheer . 
17580	4	a	i'm here . i'm a part of this now . 
17581	1	a	you needed to speak to me ? 
17582	1	a	i prefer to stand . less blood clots . 
17583	1	a	do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses ? comparisons are hard . 
17584	1	a	your concern is noted . 
17585	1	a	like a wolf . thank you . 
17586	1	a	really ? 
17587	1	a	 it's firm . 
17588	3	a	 i need you to get me the prices that you're charging ed's tires so i can undercut dunder mifflin . 
17589	1	a	i don't know that i can do that now . you know , uh , something's come up . 
17590	3	a	oh n- is it mose ? did you put the cover on that well ? 
17591	1	a	no , mose is fine . i roped it off . it's not about mose . listen , things are changing here , michael , they're changing fast . 
17592	3	a	i'm not following you . 
17593	1	a	imagine . . . someone has a personal hero they really wanna help . but then there's this new guy . very cool , very will smith-esque , who would not like it if he helped his hero . 
17594	3	a	personal hero , cool new guy . okay , i think i'm getting your drift . 
17595	1	a	good , do you see what i'm saying ? 
17596	3	a	crystal clear . so is this for a movie that you're writing ? 
17597	1	a	no . 
17598	3	a	can i use it ? 
17599	1	a	no . 
17600	3	a	 dwight , are you talking about us ? 
17601	1	a	it is possible that i could be talking about us . 
17602	3	a	someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now ? 
17603	1	a	it is the situation that we are in now . 
17604	3	a	so i would say that the old boss has always been good to dwight , and he was there first , so he has dibs . you respect dibs , don't you ? 
17605	1	a	i'm not a barbarian . 
17606	3	a	good . will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot ? 
17607	1	a	i will . 
17608	3	a	dwight ?

17617	2	a	it's just that pam gets me through the day , you know ? i really rely on her . i'm pretty emotionally needy .

17680	1	a	michael . 
17681	3	a	i hope you're not recording this conversation . good . i cannot believe that you sided with charles . 
17682	1	a	you were making me do things that were not all right . 
17683	3	a	so you just rat me out ? you could have said no . 
17684	1	a	and not come through for you ? 
17685	3	a	if you want a truce , i will give you a truce . 
17686	1	a	i want a truce . 
17687	3	a	i do too . 
17688	1	a	let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at alfredo's . 
17689	3	a	cooper's . 
17690	1	a	i had fish yesterday . 
17691	3	a	damn it . 
17692	3	a	 oh . dwight-elicious . where you at ? 
17693	1	a	oh , hi , michael . i'm so sorry i'm late . i got stuck in traffic . 
17694	3	a	really ? that's weird . we didn't see any . 
17695	1	a	i hit a bear . 
17696	3	a	what ? 
17697	1	a	he's technically fine . i imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo . hey , listen , will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me , with extra cheese ? 
17698	3	a	yeah , sure . 
17699	1	a	ok , i will see you very soon , alright ? 
17700	3	a	okay , see you in a bit . dwight hit a bear . he'll be here in a sec . 
17701	4	a	 sounds neat . 
17702	4	a	oh my god , i think we've been robbed ! 
17703	3	a	 yeah . 
17704	1	a	did you enjoy your lunch ? 
17705	3	a	dwight , not now , we've been robbed . 
17706	1	a	no , michael , you were sabotaged . 
17707	3	a	no , dwight , we were robbed . how would you even know ? you're still stuck in traffic . you ? 
17708	1	a	me . 
17709	3	a	what about our truce ? 
17710	1	a	i broke it . 
17711	3	a	on purpose ? 
17712	1	a	yes . 
17713	3	a	why ? 
17714	1	a	you think this is some kind of game ? no , this is a war , and i will not stop , i will not rest . you have no idea what kind of enemy you've created . you have unleashed the wolf ! 
17715	3	a	be that as it may , i have your meatball parm sandwich here , and i am going to eat it . 
17716	1	a	and i knew that you would do that . the meatball parm is their worst sandwich ! 
17717	3	a	oh . bastard ! 
17718	1	a	hi there . dwight schrute here . i was just calling to see if michael scott paper was meeting all of your paper needs , and how is brenda , age four , ponytail , and simon , age 7 ? oh , you don't say . 
17719	1	a	 schrute comma dwight . and on the back he wrote , 'great salesman , better friend . ' 'tall' and 'beets . '
17720	1	a	and say hello to cheri , who is your black wife . i see you're begging for mercy , huh ? well , you will find none here . 
17721	3	a	dwight , do you mind if we talk ? 
17722	1	a	sure . that'd be fine . 
17723	3	a	if you keep coming after us , the michael scott paper company cannot succeed . 
17724	1	a	this is war and that is what happens . 
17725	3	a	oh , one more thing . i'm going to have you listen while i steal your biggest client . 
17726	1	a	oh , no . no . no . no . no . 
17727	3	a	oh , uh oh , i'm turning you down right now . 
17728	1	a	michael ! michael ! 
17729	3	a	you can hear me , but i can't hear you . 
17730	3	a	oh , great . mr . schofield's ready to see me . thank you so much . 
17731	1	a	don't let him in ! he's a traitor ! michael ! 
17732	3	a	walking in the door . . . 
17733	3	a	mr . schofield , good to see you . and i'm closing the door . 
17734	3	a	 now , when dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year , i think he is speaking out of turn . 
17735	3	a	yes . he does not have the authority to say that . i , on the other hand , am the president , the owner , and the founder . it is like you are buying software from bill gates . 
17736	1	a	are you saying you invented paper ? 
17737	0	a	 okay , okay . 
17738	2	a	oh , god . 
17739	0	a	okay , tuna . 
17740	2	a	hey . 
17741	0	a	hello . 
17742	0	a	excuse me , can i have your attention , everyone ? here's the deal , everybody , jim halpert is very upset and disturbed . i don't know if it was something you did , something you said , a look you gave him , maybe it was nothing at all , but here's the deal , ok ? it stops now . 
17743	0	a	oh , really ? 
17744	2	a	okay . 
17745	0	a	yeah , okay , what the heck is happennin' here ? 
17746	2	a	two things i need you to understand . one , pam and i are very happy together . 
17747	0	a	uh , that's not what was-
17748	2	a	and two , that stuff that happened with you and angela is a bummer , and i know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else , but you will . i promise you , you will . 
17749	0	a	oh man , he got me so good . i learned something about myself today . yeah . i wish this was a sofa , cause i feel like i could sit here and talk for hours . 
17750	3	a	what is that thing that dwight always says ? paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow ? 
17751	1	a	it's not the soil ! it's the manure ! paper is the manure ! on-time delivery is the soil ! aah ! 
17752	1	a	spin move . 
17753	1	a	ha ha ! april 13th , 2002 . 
17754	3	a	that's very rude . 
17755	1	a	i barge because i care . april 13th , 2002 , that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook , but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased . 
17756	1	a	la la la ! continuing . notice my persistence and recall . continuing ! you called dunder mifflin , and your order was filled within an hour ! 
17757	3	a	i'm going to pull a date out of the air right now . april 13th , 2002 . that is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs . is it not ? we all know that the economy is bad , and bloated companies like dunder mifflin . . . 
17758	1	a	come on . 
17759	3	a	are going to fall by the wayside . two of their branches have closed within the last year . the michael scott paper company , however , has opened a new branch this very month . 
17760	1	a	what he's not telling you is that he will abandon you . 
17761	3	a	that sounds like a fantastic idea . i will see you this weekend for the penguins . box seats as usual . 
17762	3	a	good , good , good . i will see you . 
17763	1	a	thank you , mr . schofield , for your time . much appreciated . oh , and tell me , um , how's your gay son ? 
17764	3	a	i color code all my info . i wrote 'gay son' in green . green means go , so i know to go ahead and shut up about it . orange means 'orange you glad you didn't bring it up ? ' most colors mean 'don't say it . '
17765	1	a	how is tom , the homosexual sophomore ? 
17766	3	a	he gives me leads and i take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good . and if a friend can't make you feel good , then i don't want any friends . except dwight , because he is our only source of fertile leads . 
17767	3	a	dwight just got howard family dry cleaners . 
17768	3	a	he's undercutting us big time . he's actually taking a loss and paying the difference out of pocket . 
17769	4	a	when are you ever responsible for your actions ? 
17770	3	a	hey , hey , hey . something about that seems inappropriate . 
17771	3	a	betrayal ain't just a river in egypt . 
17772	0	a	who is that knocking on my taste buds ? why , it's mr . lemon . hmmm , nice to meet you . 
17773	4	a	it's good . but won't it feel weird cutting into a cross ? 
17774	0	a	don't think of it as a cross in the judeo-christian sense , think of it more as a symbol of your lives crossing in marriage . 
17775	2	a	when i think of it like that , i do not think of the other connotations . 
17776	0	a	yes ! 
17777	4	a	i don't think so , andy . 
17778	2	a	sorry . her day . 
17779	0	a	hey , bud . 
17780	2	a	are they looking at me ? 
17781	0	a	who ? 
17782	2	a	everyone . everyone just keeps looking at me . 
17783	0	a	are you sure ? 
17784	2	a	will you just talk to them , please ? pam just knew ! 
17785	3	a	it's 4:30 in the morning . do you know where your kids are ? if you are ryan's parents or pam's parents or my parents , you do . they're gonna be in this van . with me . who am i ? nothing to fear . i am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route . 
17786	3	a	 time to make the donuts . come on . whoa ! no , i promise i won't do it again . come on . de-nied ! 
17787	3	a	hello ! time to make the donuts ! oh , halpert ! whoa ! boner patrol . arrest that man ! your donuts make me go nuts ! hey pam . 
17788	4	a	we got the van at a used car lot . we think it says 'alleluia church of scranton . ' in korean . it was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it . 
17789	4	a	you didn't happen to bring any coffee , did you , michael ? 
17790	3	a	milk and sugar . 
17791	4	a	oh , awesome . you're a life saver . wait , is this just milk and sugar ? 
17792	3	a	that's what i said . 
17793	4	a	do you drink this every day ? 
17794	3	a	every morning . 
17795	3	a	we're , uh , we're doing okay . a couple weeks in and , um , we're having fun . uh , yep . we have 20-- of those . 
17796	4	a	 oh , oh , excuse me ! sorry . sorry , no . it's , uh , it's a paper company now . it's not for the church . 
17797	2	a	oh , they're my client . 
17798	1	a	 shame , jim . i expected more . 
17799	0	a	hey , boss . uh , i'd just like to point out that i have been here less time than these guys . 
17800	0	a	i just think the bar should be lower for a newbie . 
17801	0	a	i don't want to have said that . but i think it's important that you know it . 
17802	1	a	it's not your fault . some people just don't want to be inspired . 
17803	1	a	been there , done that . 
17804	3	a	you know what we need ? we need some couches in here . 
17805	3	a	oh , you know what you would love ? is if we built a loft . 
17806	4	a	why would i love that ? can we afford a delivery guy ? 
17807	3	a	like in a dorm room . you put your desk underneath , you have your loft up top . you can sleep up top . 
17808	4	a	yeah , i know what a loft is . 
17809	3	a	most do in the magazines . 
17810	3	a	we should look into that . or we just go for the loft . 
17811	2	a	hey , david . 
17812	1	a	david wallace ! hello , we've been expecting you , david wallace . charles and i were waiting for you . 
17813	1	a	come along , afterthought . 
17814	3	a	how much can we afford to pay a delivery guy ? 
17815	3	a	they are correct , sir . 
17816	3	a	okay . a lame attempt at humor . swing and a miss . 
17817	3	a	lowest in town . 
17818	4	a	corporate greed ? 
17819	3	a	okay , sure . right , so-- why don't you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is . 
17820	3	a	explain that . 
17821	3	a	well , we don't--
17822	3	a	whatever , yeah . 
17823	3	a	our prices are the only thing keeping us in business . 
17824	3	a	okay , okay . hold on , hold on . ty , i would like you to crunch those numbers again . 
17825	3	a	just crunch 'em . just crunch 'em please . 
17826	4	a	did it help ? 
17827	3	a	hi , jerry . michael scott . well , this is slightly embarrassing . um , i'm going to have to . . . ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday . yeah . we did . we got the check , but we're just going to need a much , much bigger check . 
17828	4	a	when a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree , you don't blame the child . he didn't know any better . you blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said , 'drive , kid . i trust you . '
17829	2	a	now , would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers ? 
17830	1	a	stupid . yeah , makes us look weak . 
17831	1	a	i say we fill michael's office with bees . my apiarist owes me a favor . 
17832	2	a	really ? does he do good work or--
17833	1	a	 no , jim . i use a bad apiarist . 
17834	1	a	five minutes exactly . 
17835	1	a	sure thing . 
17836	2	a	 hey . i saw you called . 
17837	2	a	you're just out of business ? 
17838	4	a	we have maybe a month . i don't know what i'm gonna do . 
17839	2	a	oh , yeah , well don't worry about it . we'll figure it out . we'll be okay . 
17840	4	a	that's what michael said . 
17841	2	a	oh , yeah . only this time we will be okay . oh , that's my new 'dwight' ring . 
17842	4	a	i like it . 
17843	2	a	good , right ? hello . 
17844	1	a	 idiot , we're starting back up . this is dwight , by the way . 
17845	2	a	oh , okay . don't worry about it . 
17846	3	a	did i ever tell you about the day that steve martin died ? 
17847	4	a	steve martin's not dead , michael . 
17848	3	a	i know . but i always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life . i was wrong . it's this . 
17849	4	a	you want to hear something sad ? 
17850	3	a	i would love that . 
17851	4	a	so jim and i are getting married and the wedding's really expensive . so i tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money . i applied to old navy , target and wal-mart . none of 'em called me back . not even for an interview . 
17852	4	a	really ? 
17853	3	a	was it nice ? 
17854	3	a	i love pad thai . 
17855	3	a	no . there's a lot i haven't done . 
17856	2	a	now , this is the projection over three months ? 
17857	1	a	let me float something out there , okay ? can i just say-- can i say something ? 
17858	1	a	there is a hive of bees outside the front door . we kidnap the queen , extract her alarm pheromones , place them on a flushable wipe , put that in his bathroom . 
17859	2	a	oh , but you didn't . 
17860	1	a	oh , man ! if only michael had children . that's how you really apply the pressure . 
17861	2	a	oh , i don't know . you know , they've taken a good deal of clients , so--
17862	2	a	i mean i guess-- i guess i could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction . 
17863	1	a	you know what ? why don't i do it , okay ? michael adores me . i'm the man for this job . charles , you got my back on this ? 
17864	2	a	okay , so i'll be back in , um-- back in a bit . 
17865	3	a	 hmm ? 
17866	2	a	hey , can i talk to you guys for a second ? 
17867	3	a	we're not hiring , jim . 
17868	2	a	actually here for something else . 
17869	3	a	listen , i can't make you laugh right now . 
17870	2	a	you know i love a good guessing game , but why don't i just tell you what i'm here for ? turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the dunder mifflin sales . 
17871	2	a	david wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in dunder mifflin buying you out . 
17872	4	a	seriously ? are you being serious ? 
17873	3	a	jim , what you don't understand is that this company's worthl--
17874	2	a	oh ! 
17875	3	a	no-- we don't have--
17876	2	a	oh ! see i'm here to learn as little information as possible . all i really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout . 
17877	3	a	 uh . . . yes . 
17878	4	a	yes . 
17879	2	a	three yeses . i will see you titans of industry upstairs . 
17880	3	a	yes , well , we're not only tight-ends , we are also quarterbacks . 
17881	2	a	missed the last part . 
17882	3	a	that's a pun . 
17883	2	a	got it . 
17884	3	a	yep . oh . . . wow . 
17885	3	a	of course not . 
17886	3	a	nope , nope , nope . 
17887	4	a	just to reiterate , none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke . 
17888	3	a	right , right . there is no way in hell that i am going to say that we're broke . 
17889	3	a	oh , i'm really worried that i'm going to say it . 
17890	4	a	no , michael . 
17891	3	a	ah . . . 
17892	4	a	we have to come from a position of strength . 
17893	3	a	i'm good , i'm good . 
17894	3	a	it is . i'm good . 
17895	3	a	hello . 
17896	3	a	michael scott paper company to see mr . david wallace . i believe we're expected . well , well , well . how the turntables . . . 
17897	3	a	and we are prepared to reject that offer . 
17898	3	a	never accept their first offer . what is your second offer ? 
17899	3	a	are you kidding me ? that is insultingly low . i don't even want to hear what your first offer was . 
17900	3	a	 we'll have to talk--
17901	4	a	mm-hmm . 
17902	3	a	just amongst ourselves . 
17903	3	a	oh , my god . oh , my god . 
17904	4	a	$60 , 000 . 00
17905	3	a	we are so rich . 
17906	4	a	are you kidding me ? 
17907	1	a	well , jerry , the one who got away . may i ask why you're leaving the michael scott paper company ? really ? please hold . charles . 
17908	1	a	may i have your attention ? the michael scott paper company is broke . 
17909	1	a	they've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money . that can only mean one thing . they're desperate . which can only mean one thing . they're total failures . 
17910	2	a	great work dwight . 
17911	1	a	quiet you . 
17912	2	a	no , i mean , great detective work . 'cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked , right ? 
17913	1	a	you don't crack a case . that has pejorative connotation . that's like calling a policeman a cop . you solve a case , and yes , i've solved plenty . 
17914	2	a	what are your top five cases ? 
17915	1	a	i'm gonna answer charles first . 
17916	2	a	because you've solved zero cases . 
17917	1	a	okay , one . case of the beet bandit . missing beets from all over the farm . no footprints . inside job . mose in socks . boom , case closed . 
17918	1	a	done .

17923	4	a	can you give us another minute please ? 
17924	4	a	michael . 
17925	4	a	why are you assuming you'd get the whole thing ? 
17926	3	a	it's a lot of money , okay . but we need money coming in every week . we need jobs . wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish ? 
17927	4	a	no , michael's right . jobs are safer . 
17928	3	a	agreed ? 
17929	4	a	agreed . but that's all , okay . 
17930	3	a	shut up , shut up . hello ? 
17931	3	a	i want my old job back . i want my old parking space back . i want a sebring .

17941	3	a	and dental this time . 
17942	3	a	these are our demands . 
17943	3	a	our company is worth nothing . that's the difference between you and i . business isn't about money to me , david . if tomorrow my company goes under , i will just start another paper company . and then another and another and another . i have no shortage of company names . 
17944	3	a	that's one of 'em ! yes . these are our demands . this is what we want . our balls are in your court . 
17945	3	a	can we have the room please ? 
17946	4	a	alright ! 
17947	3	a	yes ! can you believe it ? that's what i'm talking about ! 
17948	3	a	no , no . you're done . 
17949	3	a	someone is returning ! he started his own company , and now he's back . who could it be ? i'll give you a hint . he is a man . a man you have missed with all your heart . a man who has ruined all other men for you . who is it ? 
17950	4	a	 who is it ? 
17951	3	a	 it's michael scott . hold it up . conference room , five minutes . 
17952	1	a	 wh--what are you doing ? 
17953	3	a	if there is something that you would like to say as a group , then by all means , you may say it to me right now . 
17954	3	a	yes . 
17955	3	a	take it up with toby . what i want you to do , is i want you to look inward . and i want you to reflect . and i want you to say something different . 
17956	2	a	can you give us a hint ? 
17957	3	a	oscar , what were you going to say ? 
17958	3	a	all right . 
17959	3	a	not important . okay , alright . yes . yes , you have a job . frankly , you have a job because ryan and pam are starting with us as salesmen . 
17960	1	a	wait , what ? 
17961	3	a	it's going to work very smoothly , because pam and ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from michael scott paper company and--
17962	1	a	yeah , aren't we getting those clients back ? 
17963	3	a	no , you lost those clients . 
17964	0	a	i call foul , sir . 
17965	3	a	okay . 
17966	1	a	you were bought out . so the company then bought out all of the stolen clients . 
17967	3	a	okay , dwight . let me explain something to you . i set the rules and you follow them . blindly . okay ? and if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department . it's a trash can . 
17968	4	a	 boscov's at the steamtown mall ? 
17969	4	a	well , you have good taste . 
17970	4	a	what ? 
17971	4	a	oh , i , um . . . 
17972	3	a	 there you are , my friend . 
17973	3	a	pamela . 
17974	4	a	thank , michael . 
17975	3	a	yep . 
17976	1	a	fresh hot ink . 
17977	1	a	trust me , stanley , you're going to want to read this memo very carefully . 
17978	1	a	no , no . this goes for all of you . believe me , you are going to want to heat my words . 
17979	1	a	when held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately . do not ask me where i got the invisible ink . urine . it was urine . 
17980	0	a	andrew bernard . 
17981	1	a	okay , what are you still doing at your desk ? 
17982	0	a	what are you still doing not at your desk ? 
17983	1	a	did you even read the memo ? 
17984	0	a	all my files are now in reverse alphabetical order--
17985	1	a	no , you idiot . there is a code embedded in the memo . listen , you need to round up all the salesmen , except for ryan and pam , and get them down to the warehouse pronto . 
17986	0	a	oh , it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn . 
17987	1	a	stop doing rhyming poetry . just tell them , please . god , the simplest thing . 
17988	1	a	we're in crisis mode here , do you understand ? the two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together . and frankly , i'm not convinced that michael and pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone . 
17989	2	a	can i address that ? 
17990	1	a	no , you're too close . 
17991	2	a	okay . 
17992	1	a	stanley , how do you feel about those two taking your clients ? 
17993	1	a	he doesn't like it . 
17994	1	a	her face is okay , but-- jesus ! what --what are you doing here ? 
17995	1	a	get out ! we need to do something . i'm thinking maybe a coup or we take ryan hostage . 
17996	1	a	no , i'm not saying we do those things . i'm saying something like those things . 
17997	2	a	of course . what is like a hostage ? 
17998	1	a	excellent question . 
17999	0	a	we could write a strong-worded letter . 
18000	1	a	words will never be enough . 
18001	2	a	strongly-painted picture . 
18002	1	a	no , pictures are too interpretive . 
18003	2	a	can i just say something ? i know that tempers are high , but i think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to michael directly . 
18004	1	a	oh . well , that--that's a great idea , jim . oh , i totally see your point . okay , we'll talk to michael directly . so uh , meeting is over , i guess . i'll see everyone upstairs . 
18005	2	a	great . see you upstairs . 
18006	1	a	c'mon . guys . psst , listen . now is the time for action . i'm talking action--
18007	4	a	that one's great . 
18008	3	a	i know . 
18009	3	a	i do ? well--where is that bowl ? 
18010	2	a	hey , you have a second ? 
18011	3	a	michael scott paper company only . 
18012	2	a	yeah , i think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen . 
18013	3	a	okay , well---
18014	3	a	i will--no , no . i'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom . 
18015	2	a	this is awkward to talk about , but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny forming in the warehouse right now . 
18016	3	a	against who ? 
18017	4	a	what ? 
18018	3	a	the old michael scott might have taken this , but not the new michael scott . they are in for a bitter surprise . i am not to be truffled with . 
18019	3	a	six weeks ago , none of these people wanted to come with me . you two were the only ones with the stones to follow . 
18020	4	a	mm-hmmm . 
18021	3	a	that was us , right there . 
18022	4	a	we were something else . 
18023	3	a	mm-hmm .

18033	3	a	so since you guys already ate , you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch , will you ? oh , wow , stanley . is that egg salad ? andy brought some salmon .

18036	1	a	it's pony . 
18037	3	a	mom . what kind of sauce is on your salmon ? 
18038	0	a	dijonnaise . 
18039	3	a	mmm . thanks for going out , guys . 
18040	4	a	mmm . 
18041	2	a	well , what if i just do this ? 
18042	2	a	i'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over . with creed . playing chess . at work . he's winning . i feel like i'm describing a dream i had . 
18043	1	a	whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . give me the phone . give me the phone . 
18044	1	a	that's my client .

18051	1	a	ah ! mr . bart ! ugh ! [slams phone down[ i cannot believe you lost that account . he was my client for ten years ! 
18052	4	a	you made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time . it's okay , ryan . 
18053	1	a	you're a secretary ! what do you know ? 
18054	1	a	and you're a temp and i'm taking your phone . i'm confiscating this . 
18055	3	a	hey , hey guys . you know what i want you to do ? shake hands , get over it . that was not a shake , dwight . 
18056	1	a	we want our clients back or we quit , michael . 
18057	3	a	who quits ? 
18058	0	a	me too . 
18059	3	a	you guys gotta be kidding . 
18060	1	a	no , we gotta be deadly serious . we'll start our own paper company . the schrute-bernard-lapin-vance . . . stanley paper company . 
18061	3	a	yes i do . 
18062	0	a	that's completely backwards . 
18063	3	a	it's frontward's . 
18064	1	a	right . 
18065	3	a	no matter how i look at this , i am in the wrong . and i have looked at this thing , like a hundred different ways . from my point of view , from their point of view . . . 98 others . and the bottom line , i am in the wrong . i'm the bad guy . 
18066	3	a	i need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without ryan and pam knowing . 
18067	1	a	gasp . are you talking about a secret meeting ? 
18068	3	a	whatever you guys did earlier . 
18069	1	a	i don't know that first things about secret meetings . 
18070	3	a	just do it , okay ? 
18071	1	a	i'll do--
18072	3	a	get 'em there . get 'em there . 
18073	1	a	i'll do the best i can . 
18074	3	a	are you kidding me ? 
18075	1	a	deceit does not come easy to me . 
18076	3	a	okay , okay , okay . 
18077	3	a	so from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart , i am sorry . 
18078	3	a	if we could just focus and go down the line , and everyone would say , 'apology accepted' , i think we would all feel better . and then we can break out my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark . 
18079	3	a	they wouldn't make it unless people liked it . 
18080	3	a	okay . if i give you your clients back there won't be enough clients for ryan and pam , and i promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople . 
18081	3	a	fine , have your clients . i can see that's what you wanted all along . however , i rescind my apology . 
18082	1	a	that's fair . 
18083	3	a	you are not reacting at all as i had hoped . 
18084	4	a	he can only keep one of us as a salesperson now . he'll make his decision by the end of the day . 
18085	4	a	oh . i think you should get it . you've changed a lot and you'd be good at it . 
18086	4	a	yeah . 
18087	2	a	oh , i'm engaged to pam . 
18088	2	a	then why would you want to set me up with your daughter ? 
18089	3	a	jim . can i talk to you for a minute ? 
18090	2	a	sure . let me just finish this turn . 
18091	3	a	 and bingo was his name . let's go . 
18092	3	a	i need your help . this whole pam/ryan debate is screwing with my head . 
18093	2	a	i don't want to be biased , but i am very close to ryan . you know that . 
18094	3	a	you're close with pam too . 
18095	2	a	eh , she's nice , i guess . you know what ? best thing to do , pros and cons list . 
18096	3	a	pro for ryan , he went to business school , he's my number one choice . 
18097	2	a	well , that's--
18098	3	a	i like his hair . 
18099	2	a	cons , ryan . he defrauded the company . he has never made a sale . 
18100	3	a	okay . 
18101	2	a	he definitely stole my ipod . 
18102	3	a	that sounds pretty biased . 
18103	2	a	you didn't hear my pros . environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday . 
18104	3	a	okay . pam , pros . 
18105	2	a	mm-hmm . 
18106	3	a	i like her . i think that she is a fast learner . cons , she doesn't always follow through . sh--new york and the whole art school thing . and roy . she has a weird voice . 
18107	2	a	that's not true . 
18108	3	a	i don't need to tell you that . 
18109	2	a	i think she'd be a really good salesperson . 
18110	3	a	i don't think you are being totally impartial though , because you haven't said one bad thing about pam . 
18111	2	a	and i won't . 
18112	3	a	okay . so be it , then you've lost credibility . and i'm going to go with my guy , and that's ryan . 
18113	2	a	all right . you're right , sometimes when she's tired , she can be a little bit shrill . but that's not a weird voice . 
18114	3	a	oh , wow ! whoa ! 
18115	2	a	take it easy . 
18116	3	a	ho-ho , man ! wow . honey ! i want you to bring the garbage out . 'cause i'm not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba--
18117	3	a	i have a very difficult decision to make . it's like last week i was at the video store . do i rent devil wears prada again ? or do i finally get around to seeing sophie's choice ? it is what you would call a classic difficult decision . 
18118	0	a	you don't understand clothing , toby . you're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki . 
18119	1	a	listen up , flenderson . you're being weak and ineffectual . i'm cowboying this meeting , okay ? here are the new rules . earth tones only . also , women are forbidden to wear pants . 
18120	1	a	no . 
18121	1	a	that's debatable . 
18122	0	a	you're running from the problem . 
18123	3	a	pam , can you come in here , please ? have a seat . well , there's no easy way of saying this . so i think i will just . . . drag it out . since the dawn of time there has been--
18124	4	a	just tell me . 
18125	3	a	i gave ryan the sales job . there just weren't enough clients for the two of you . so i had to--
18126	4	a	no , okay . 
18127	3	a	i'm sorry , sorry . 
18128	4	a	okay , i get it . why are you giggling ? is this a joke ? michael , is this-- did i get the job ? 
18129	3	a	 yes , you did . 
18130	4	a	i did ? 
18131	3	a	yep . 
18132	4	a	for real , you're not kidding ? 
18133	3	a	no , you--no . 
18134	4	a	i did ? 
18135	3	a	no , you're the best person for the job . you're going to be great . 
18136	4	a	oh , michael , thank you . thank you . 
18137	3	a	 oh , oh ! 
18138	4	a	thank you . you will not be sorry . 
18139	3	a	you should have seen your face . oh man ! oh , that was classic . 
18140	4	a	oh . i really thought i didn't get it . 
18141	3	a	oh , really ? 
18142	4	a	yeah . 'cause you said i didn't
18143	3	a	oh , man . that was really good . that was really good . 
18144	4	a	what about ryan ? 
18145	3	a	i don't know , i offered him his temp job back . we'll see . he was not happy at all when i offered him this job and then i told him he didn't get the job , so--
18146	4	a	yeah . maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore . 
18147	3	a	i don't appreciate you telling me what to do . so clean out your desk , you are through here . 
18148	4	a	thanks , michael . 
18149	3	a	oh ! what's our receptionists name ? 
18150	4	a	erin . 
18151	3	a	could you send her in ? 
18152	4	a	 erin . michael wants to see you . 
18153	3	a	hello . 
18154	3	a	have a seat . 
18155	3	a	this is very difficult to say , but no one here like you in the office and we are going to have to let you go . hank , could you come up here please ? hank is our security guard--
18156	3	a	he will be ushering you out . 
18157	3	a	oh , your face ! oh ! 
18158	3	a	no , i'm kidding . no , you're not--you're not fired . yet . 
18159	3	a	oh . . . 
18160	3	a	i don't know , actually . 
18161	1	a	shut up . 
18162	1	a	 i got her ! 
18163	4	a	not cool , dwight . 
18164	2	a	not cool . 
18165	3	a	guys , i'm scared . i'm really scared . i think i'm growing into a giant . because look at this normal sized coffee cup . looks so tiny in my giant hand now . anybody want to go to lunch with me later on ? 
18166	1	a	i do . 
18167	3	a	okay . how about a woman ? pam ? 
18168	4	a	oh , i can't do lunch . i was just sending you an email . jim and i need to leave early today to meet with our contractor . 
18169	3	a	oh , really ? ok . 
18170	4	a	just sent it . 
18171	3	a	what about the rest of you ? 
18172	3	a	at dunder-mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and i don't know who instituted it . i think it started right after my predecessor stepped down , but at the michael scott paper company i really enjoyed having lunch with pam and ryan everyday . so , rules be damned , i wanna have lunch with these people . 
18173	3	a	who else ? who else ? ryan ? 
18174	3	a	ok . anyone ? anyone ? at all ? accounting ? i am accounting on you to go to lunch with me . 
18175	3	a	what ? 
18176	3	a	ugh ! god ! what happened to you people ? we are just office drones . we are office drones . all we do is work . . . is work . 
18177	4	a	if you don't take out his battery , he just keeps going all day . 
18178	4	a	oh , no . your battery fell out . 
18179	3	a	 i . . . was just learning . . . to . . . love . 
18180	1	a	erin , how many times do i have to tell you ? it is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us . 
18181	1	a	 now , how can i help you ? 
18182	1	a	attention , office . who here is planning a trip to youngstown , ohio ? i will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something . this location is the superior court -
18183	4	a	so someone is going to a court . big deal . 
18184	1	a	it is a big deal . cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in ohio and not be charged with a crime . to claim an inheritance from a deceased relative . to obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15 . erin , let me see your birth certificate . 
18185	2	a	there are other reasons to go to ohio . 
18186	4	a	we're getting married today . 
18187	2	a	so , it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period . 
18188	4	a	tell 'em how it happened . 
18189	2	a	ok . so , we're going through all the wedding plans and , boy , it is complicated . 
18190	4	a	and very expensive . 
18191	2	a	very expensive . cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -
18192	4	a	you can't leave anyone out . 
18193	2	a	no one . 
18194	4	a	ok , just get to the good part . 
18195	2	a	ok . right . oh , so this morning we are having breakfast together and i just looked up from my cereal and i said , ' you know what i want to do today ? i want to marry you . '
18196	4	a	i had just woken up . i didn't look cute . that's how i knew he meant it . 
18197	3	a	no work . no work . no work . i come in here to release frustration . ooh . ah . ah . ah . ooh . 
18198	3	a	that's good . 
18199	3	a	if you ever want to come down here , door's always open , lock's broken , so . . . 
18200	3	a	come on in . hey , hey , hey . here we go . here we go . yeah . 
18201	3	a	now you got it . 
18202	3	a	now you got it . hey , you want some espresso ? 
18203	3	a	you gotta keep yourself dehydrated . 
18204	3	a	ok . i love it . i love it . 
18205	3	a	i love it . 
18206	3	a	guys , i believe that i have figured out what is up your butts . there's no reason to be scared . the bad man is gone . charles is gone . 
18207	3	a	charles really did a number on these guys . they are way too focused on work . when i was in charge , this place was like dave and buster's people just hanging out , having , fun , eating apps . i don't know . it's like dave died or something . 
18208	3	a	daddy's here and daddy is going to take care of you . 
18209	3	a	i am your big daddy and i am gonna kiss da boo boo . 
18210	0	a	 wittle andy is afwaid . 
18211	3	a	andy's afwaid ? 
18212	0	a	yes . 
18213	3	a	are you all afwaid ? 
18214	1	a	no . 
18215	3	a	daddy's here for you . my wittle angels . ok . i think that i have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk . 
18216	4	a	what ? 
18217	3	a	funk is the problem and the solution . 
18218	2	a	that makes sense . 
18219	3	a	i've taken my downstairs office and i have turned it into a place to hang out . a place where unattractive and attractive people can get together . to meet . to greet . to see the ones that you love . to love the ones that you see . 
18220	3	a	why don't you get over lunch , oscar ? everybody else is past it . 
18221	1	a	 all work and no play makes michael a dull boy . 
18222	3	a	no . dwight is confusing you . that - it's , it's more of a disco . 
18223	0	a	it's like a haunted disco . 
18224	3	a	 . . . with coffee but without the haunted . 
18225	3	a	it's a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building . 
18226	3	a	exactly . 
18227	3	a	wha - no . no . not even close . i can't force you to go down but i can entice you . i'm gonna be down there . erin will be down there from time to time . . . and all-you-can-eat espresso . 
18228	3	a	well , kevin , i guess it is just me and you . 
18229	3	a	holdin' down the fort . 
18230	3	a	thank you . 
18231	3	a	this is a no work zone . please respect the lei . 
18232	3	a	kevin , stay . 
18233	3	a	kevin , stay . 
18234	3	a	stay , stay . 
18235	3	a	cookie . kevin , cookie . 
18236	3	a	mmm-hmm .

18580	0	a	 no ! but , let me kick you a scenario . i'm at a beach cabana , and brad pitt approaches . he tries to lean in and kiss me . i would definitely resist , like at first . but if he was persistent , i think i might give in a little bit , just to see what it . . . felt like . 
18581	0	a	would i push him away ? how hard ? like , what if he's like really aggressive ? 
18582	0	a	it's not real brad pitt , this is like , this is my fantasy . or it's like , not a fantasy , it's just . . . it's just a scenario .

18586	1	a	 well now you can't call me at all . problem solved . 
18587	2	a	 you're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs . 
18588	0	a	 tuna , how come you never try to set me up ? 
18589	2	a	oh , i don't really do that . but pam might have some friends , though .

18597	2	a	really . 
18598	0	a	yeah , the evidence is sort of stacked against me , i feel like . . . 
18599	2	a	well you gotta figure this out . 
18600	0	a	yeah , right ? 
18601	2	a	yeah ! 
18602	0	a	how ? 
18603	2	a	you gotta have sex with a woman .

18614	4	a	why did that come into your brain ? 
18615	2	a	 can i talk to you for a second ? 
18616	2	a	 so , they know . 
18617	4	a	who did you tell ? 
18618	2	a	i didn't tell anyone ! who did you tell ? 
18619	4	a	nobody ! 
18620	2	a	hey , has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today ? 
18621	3	a	 yeah , yeah . . . you know what ? let's discredit these rumors . 
18622	2	a	yeah , sure , but . . . who's been saying all that stuff ? 
18623	3	a	that's not important , jim , i just think we shouldn't listen to any of that crap . 
18624	4	a	sure , but we should get to the bottom of this . let's pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning . 
18625	0	a	i heard it from erin . 
18626	4	a	 michael ? he's over here ! 
18627	4	a	 where are you going ? 
18628	3	a	nowhere . 
18629	1	a	michael . . . you told people i use store-bought manure , when i showed you where my manure comes from . hmm ? hmm ? 
18630	4	a	don't get on it . 
18631	2	a	michael , don't . 
18632	4	a	don't . . . get . . . on . do not . 
18633	2	a	michael . . . 
18634	4	a	step away . 
18635	3	a	 okay , i made it all up . 
18636	0	a	even the fact that i'm gay ? 
18637	3	a	yes . 
18638	0	a	 yes ! 
18639	3	a	but guys , i'm a victim here too , okay ? people here have been saying that i'm a j . crew model . 
18640	3	a	jim ? no , no . i spread the rumor that somebody here was a j . crew model , and i was referring to myself . 
18641	3	a	because a lot of people think that models , even though they're very attractive , are somewhat vapid . it's set our industry back quite a bit . 
18642	3	a	okay , okay . . . here's the thing . there was one true rumor out there today . i didn't want everybody to know what it was . so all of you are off the hook , except for this one person . 
18643	0	a	michael . . . am i gay ? 
18644	3	a	 the one true rumor , and this is going to ruin this person's life , is that . . . 
18645	2	a	 that pam's pregnant . 
18646	2	a	okay . thank you . 
18647	1	a	who's the father ? 
18648	4	a	jim . 
18649	2	a	four months . 
18650	4	a	stop . don't . just . . . 
18651	3	a	alright , alright . . . you know , this is not the truth , and you can't fall on the sword this way . the real thing is that stanley hudson had an affair . 
18652	2	a	nope . 
18653	3	a	yes . jim . . . 
18654	2	a	 thank you for trying to defend her . but actually , pam is pregnant , and we can prove it . 
18655	4	a	yes . 
18656	2	a	if everyone would like to see proof . 
18657	4	a	okay . 
18658	3	a	look at that ! that is the inside of your vagina ! 
18659	4	a	 it's clear why we were trying not to tell people . that's clear now . 
18660	3	a	 how long have you known about the pregnancy ? 
18661	3	a	a week ? a month ? a year ? 
18662	2	a	michael , we only told our parents last week . 
18663	3	a	did you pee on a stick ? 
18664	2	a	i did . it was inconclusive . 
18665	3	a	you should've told me . 
18666	4	a	 you're right . we should've realized that you are an equal part of this . 
18667	4	a	 you called stanley's wife ? 
18668	3	a	oh , oh . . . yeah , a long time ago , just to make sure she was out of town . oh . . . oh god . 
18669	2	a	don't take it . 
18670	3	a	no , i have to take it , or it'll seem suspicious . 
18671	4	a	if you talk to her , you're gonna tell her about stanley , and that's gonna seem more suspicious . 
18672	3	a	no , no , i can do this . 
18673	2	a	you can't do this . 
18674	3	a	yes , i can . i am going to tell her that i need to redecorate my condo , and i need her help . we will haggle about money , and then i will back down , and then i won't talk to her until this whole cynthia thing has blown over . 
18675	2	a	that sounds terrible . 
18676	4	a	michael , please don't . 
18677	3	a	 hey , what up , cynthia ? 
18678	3	a	hold on a second , cynthia . 
18679	3	a	 yeah ? 
18680	3	a	yes , oscar come on in . close the door if you would . thank you , thanks so much for talking to me . 
18681	3	a	i'm going in for a procedure today . 
18682	3	a	yeah , it's routine . i'm just a little bit scared . 
18683	3	a	it is a colonoscopy . 
18684	3	a	in your experience , what should i be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions ? is there anything i can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for dr . shaundry ? 
18685	3	a	my main concern , should i have a safe word ? 
18686	3	a	abso . . . you know what ? i'll do you one better , sunday , sunday night . 
18687	3	a	ho , hol , hold on big guy , i'm gonna put it in the mail sunday night and you'll get it weds . 
18688	2	a	sure . 
18689	4	a	hey , good luck . 
18690	3	a	oh right , this thing . i remember now . what's this about ? 
18691	2	a	ah , this is just me and david , if that's okay . 
18692	3	a	it's okay with me but he's gonna want me in there . 
18693	3	a	really ? 
18694	3	a	alright , do you mind if it sit this out ? i have so much work to do , i feel like i'm gonna blow my brains out . 
18695	3	a	am i worried that jim and david are having a meeting without me ? no , because we are the three amigos . and once in awhile one of the amigos will go off . . . to the bathroom . . . while the other two have a secret meeting . 
18696	3	a	hey let me escort you to your desk . 
18697	4	a	okay , it's just three or four steps but thank you , thank you . 
18698	3	a	you and jim are close , huh ? 
18699	4	a	yeah , i think the pregnancy really brought us together . 
18700	3	a	hey , what do you think he and david are talking about ? what do you . . . 
18701	4	a	ummm , i don't know . 
18702	3	a	well , you said good luck to jim as he walked in . 
18703	4	a	did i ? doesn't sound like me , not very superstitious . 
18704	3	a	if you are lying to me right now pam , your baby is gonna come out a liar . that's how it works . they inherit things through the breast milk . 
18705	4	a	please don't talk about my breast milk . 
18706	3	a	i just don't want you to lie to me . i don't want you to ever lie to me . have i ever lied to you ? 
18707	4	a	yeah . 
18708	3	a	i just don't want you to .

18729	3	a	 how are your sales doin' ?

18731	0	a	oh , i'm sorry phyllis , you explain this email , okay . 'hey andy let's go visit grandma and then get drunk together , ha ha . '
18732	3	a	shhh , i'm just trying to figure out what's going on in that room , okay ? 
18733	3	a	wallace had to show up on the one four month period that i'm completely overwhelmed . 
18734	3	a	you know when they say it's so crazy it just might work ? well , i don't believe that . i say go for the air-tight plan and that is why i am having andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart . it is just elegant . 
18735	3	a	 be my eyes . 
18736	0	a	you got it . 
18737	0	a	oh , just backing up and turning around . 
18738	0	a	dit , dit , dit , dit , it's not for you . pardon moi , messieurs . i took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which i will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room . 
18739	2	a	no , i won't . alright , thanks for giving me your time , i appreciate it . 
18740	3	a	 hey , hey , you must have walked right past me . how you doin' ? 
18741	3	a	yes , definitely . 
18742	1	a	nah , that's a ge . a p40 is much higher pitched . 
18743	1	a	i have been my whole life . 
18744	1	a	i'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house . 
18745	1	a	yeah . 
18746	1	a	yeah , it's just a run of the mill slaughter house , but sure anytime . 
18747	1	a	wa . . . wa . . . wait , someone's coming . 
18748	1	a	here , get down ! he's not using crutches ! get the camera !

18752	4	a	hey ryan . 
18753	4	a	so , i just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to my wedding . 
18754	4	a	it costs about $75 per person . 
18755	4	a	can you just tell me now if you're coming or not ? 
18756	4	a	okay , ryan howard , yes . 
18757	4	a	kelly kapoor , yes . 
18758	3	a	look who you're talking to . 
18759	3	a	well i would say that my greatest talent is being the best man , woman , or child , to have ever run this branch , ever . 
18760	3	a	 permission to speak on the record ? 
18761	3	a	very much , jim is my best friend . but it's his performance report . . . right here . now this was written by toby , who we all know is extremely reliable . 
18762	3	a	it's not very well written , but you get the gist . 
18763	3	a	i can just continue to run it myself . 
18764	3	a	this was jim's idea ? 
18765	3	a	wow . ummm , well i'd have to talk to my mother and my guy at h and r block . 
18766	2	a	i didn't tell michael because i thought he'd try to help . example , he handed out jello shots at the 23rd mile of the steamtown marathon . 
18767	2	a	sure . 
18768	3	a	 i can't help but feel partially responsible . 
18769	3	a	 little pick me up ? oh those are the best . little sugar rush . 
18770	2	a	when you were in the office earlier talking to wallace , did i come up at all ? 
18771	3	a	well we did talk about how handsome you are . 
18772	2	a	why don't we head in your office to talk ? 
18773	3	a	oh what a week , god . we said . . . i know there were certain things we said . . . 
18774	2	a	michael , look i'll just be honest with you . earlier today i spoke with wallace about a promotion . i actually think that talk went really well . and then after he spoke with you , for some reason it felt like things had changed . 
18775	3	a	hmmm , that's weird , that's weird . . . it's kinda weirding me out . did you know that lincoln's secretary was named kennedy . 
18776	2	a	michael , did you say anything ? 
18777	3	a	tell you what , when you leave this office i am going to call wallace and i am going to tell him that you should get that promotion . 
18778	2	a	really ? 
18779	3	a	yes ! 
18780	2	a	you will ? wanna do it right now ? 
18781	3	a	yes . 
18782	2	a	i tried to keep michael in the dark . i should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark . 
18783	1	a	i need to see your pupils . i need to see if they're dilated . 
18784	1	a	we thought that she was you . 
18785	1	a	are you . . . are you serious ? be . . . cause you look exactly alike . am i the only one ? are you getting this ? 
18786	1	a	aww , darryl . 
18787	3	a	hey david , this is michael scott . michael scott here . 
18788	3	a	just wanted to talk to you about jim halpert . i understand that he did not receive the promotion . and i wanted to see what i could do to nudge you in the right direction . 
18789	3	a	absolutely , not . like i said before , jim is fantastic and he deserves this job . 
18790	3	a	wha . . . here's the thing , jim is the best man for this job , i think you should give it to him . 
18791	3	a	well , nnnn , that . . . that was an anomaly . that file had been falsified . toby flenderson is doing drugs . 
18792	1	a	wait ! they're using the lift as their own personal elevator . 
18793	1	a	he broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment , case closed . 
18794	1	a	really ? then why is there new wood only on one railing ? hmmm ? we should check the security tapes toby . 
18795	1	a	yes ! 
18796	1	a	now , i would like to file an official complaint to corporate because darryl lied on an official form . 
18797	1	a	phhhht . no judge is gonna believe that . . . 
18798	3	a	hey , hey jim , it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face . alright , just do it . 
18799	2	a	how many times have i asked you to put me up for a branch manager job . 
18800	3	a	i never recommended you because i didn't want to lose you and i didn't want to lose pam , and now i don't wanna lose the baby . 
18801	2	a	so instead , you screwed me ? 
18802	3	a	that's what she . . . 
18803	2	a	no . 
18804	3	a	kind of in the middle of something here . 
18805	3	a	i , yeah . . . no , i'll tell him myself . let's both . 
18806	3	a	 hello . 
18807	3	a	no , it's just us . 
18808	3	a	oh , oh , well here he is right now . come in . 
18809	2	a	hi david . 
18810	3	a	well just as long as it means jim becomes a manager . 
18811	2	a	wow , that sounds pretty cool . 
18812	3	a	i like that , so manager and co-manager . 
18813	3	a	well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager . 
18814	1	a	okay people , listen up , i have an announcement to make , fraud was committed . . . 
18815	3	a	okay everybody , i have an announcement to make . . . whoa do you have an announcement ? 
18816	1	a	i'm . . . i was making it . 
18817	3	a	everybody , david wallace and i have talked and we have decided to promote jim to the position of co-manager . 
18818	3	a	of your butt , and your butt , and your butt , all of the scranton branch butts . 
18819	3	a	what's happening to me ? i am also being promoted to co-manager , we will be co-managers together . jim halpert , welcome . 
18820	2	a	 thank you . 
18821	1	a	ahhhhhhhhhhhh ! 
18822	4	a	do you think that you could send in your rsvp card ? 
18823	4	a	well , you have to choose a food option and there's information in there about directions and lodging . . . 
18824	4	a	you are going to text me , the morning of my wedding . 
18825	4	a	to ask for directions . . 
18826	4	a	and you will eat whatever is fanciest ? 
18827	4	a	so rude , right ? 
18828	4	a	 oh my gosh , i have been chasing people down all day . it's incredible . 
18829	1	a	 could you please sign my expense report ? 
18830	3	a	no way , no how . expense reports are a day-to-day item . that is jim's now . i am exclusively big picture , epic . 
18831	1	a	 sign this . 
18832	2	a	ah , ah , ah . where's the 'please' ? we're not animals . 
18833	1	a	sign it . 
18834	2	a	no , not without a 'please . '
18835	1	a	idiot . 
18836	1	a	 i have a complaint about jim . 
18837	3	a	that is not big picture . 
18838	1	a	i would like to file a huge , enormous , massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office . 
18839	3	a	 . . . okay . 
18840	1	a	jim won't sign my expense report . 
18841	3	a	that is not-- okay-- that is day-to-day . 
18842	1	a	no , that is huge . 
18843	3	a	you're trying to trick me . 
18844	1	a	this has to do--
18845	3	a	get out , get out , get out , get out , get out . 
18846	1	a	 i'd like to lodge a complaint . 
18847	2	a	i'm sorry to hear about that . who is this about ? 
18848	1	a	you ! 
18849	2	a	okay . just want to let you know i take complaints very seriously . so . . . when did this happen ? 
18850	1	a	one minute ago . 
18851	2	a	okay . and how do you feel ? 
18852	1	a	angry . 
18853	2	a	all right . did he hit you ? 
18854	1	a	no . 
18855	2	a	did you cry ? 
18856	1	a	no . 
18857	2	a	did you feel like crying ? 
18858	1	a	no . 
18859	2	a	i'm just gonna write 'held back tears . '
18860	1	a	wait , stop writing that . that is not true . 
18861	2	a	if you stop crying , i'll stop writing it . 
18862	1	a	i'm not cr-- uhh ! 
18863	3	a	everyone , now would be a good time to freshen up , because i'd like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes . and i suggest that you bring a snack , because we may be in there for a while . 
18864	2	a	michael . . . 
18865	3	a	yes ? 
18866	2	a	can i talk to you in my office for a second ? 
18867	3	a	mmm , sure , but could i first talk to you in my office ? 
18868	2	a	i have noticed that we--
18869	3	a	welcome . 
18870	2	a	thank you . i've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings . 
18871	3	a	mm-hmm . 
18872	2	a	and i'm wondering if perhaps those are a bit , um--
18873	3	a	disruptive . 
18874	2	a	yes . 
18875	3	a	no , i don't think they are . i think the meetings are very important . 
18876	2	a	okay , maybe we should talk specifics . 
18877	3	a	let's do . 
18878	2	a	okay . yesterday , we had a meeting about planets . 
18879	3	a	n-- well , to be fair , jim . . . james . . . jimothy . . . to be fair , jimothy , the-- ah , that sounds weird . are you okay with being called jim ? 
18880	2	a	i am . 
18881	3	a	alright . jim , to be fair , the conversation wasn't about planets . . . 
18882	2	a	right . 
18883	3	a	at first , we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper . and what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon ? so you draw a line from there to the other planets , and i think by the end , we all learned a little bit about how small we are . 
18884	2	a	yes , i agree . 
18885	3	a	because it's a big universe , and we're all just little , tiny specks of dust . 
18886	2	a	i just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day . 
18887	3	a	you know what eats a large amount of the day are naps . you go to sleep , it's light out , you wake up , it's dark . that's the whole day . where did that day go ? i have no idea . 
18888	2	a	you mean on a weekend ? 
18889	3	a	yes . 
18890	2	a	how about this ? i think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential . 
18891	3	a	alright . no more meetings this week . 
18892	2	a	really ? you just agreed to that ? 
18893	3	a	i can be very suprising . 
18894	4	a	i need to fit into my wedding dress . however , i'm also pregnant . 
18895	4	a	we did , but mostly because people expect us to . we're also accepting other gifts not on the registry . . . however much . 
18896	4	a	it's awkward asking people for money , but we could really use it . why doesn't crate & barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash ? 
18897	4	a	oh , good . 
18898	4	a	no , we're not . 
18899	3	a	mm-hmm ? 
18900	2	a	 okay , i thought i saw people missing . 
18901	3	a	yeah , just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks . got one of each . 
18902	2	a	really ? hey , stanley , what was the last thing michael said before i came through the door ? 
18903	3	a	stanley , you don't need to answer that . 
18904	2	a	stanley ? 
18905	2	a	okay , michael , i thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these . 
18906	3	a	what do you mean by 'these people' ? 
18907	2	a	michael , this is a conference room meeting . 
18908	3	a	oh , hey , everybody , i think that jim has gone insane , because he thinks that my office is a conference room . 
18909	2	a	that's not what i meant . 
18910	3	a	listen , jim , no offense , but when push comes to shove , what i want is more important that what you want . 
18911	2	a	i disagree . 
18912	3	a	what do you guys think ? 
18913	2	a	great . guys , can i just have a moment alone with michael ? 
18914	3	a	no , no , no , you don't need to go anywhere . anything that jim has to say to me , he can say in front of these types of people . 
18915	2	a	that is not what i said , and , also , i am co-manager , meaning you are not the only manager anymore . i am also i co-manager . 
18916	3	a	that is not what wallace told us . 
18917	2	a	that's exactly what wallace told us . 
18918	3	a	that is not the way i heard it . 
18919	3	a	it is one thing , me giving you the co-manager title . it is another thing , you bossing me around . 
18920	2	a	i'm not bossing you around . i'm trying to do my job , which is sharing your job , so maybe we should just call david wallace . 
18921	3	a	no , no , no . no , we will not call david wallace . i will call david wallace . 
18922	3	a	or david wallace will call us on line two . why don't we just--
18923	2	a	hey , david . you got jim here . 
18924	3	a	hey david , this is michael , senior co-manager . 
18925	3	a	got it , dave . sounds like your classice big-picture decision . 
18926	2	a	which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees . 
18927	3	a	which is it more of ? 
18928	2	a	david , i know that i'm very new at this , but i have a very good perspective on how things work . 
18929	3	a	i thought maybe we could talk after this is over . 
18930	2	a	nope , not at all . 
18931	3	a	no , it will not be . i am on top of it . 
18932	2	a	alright , thanks alot , david . 
18933	3	a	talk to you later-- okay , you didn't let me say good-bye . alright , i am looking forward to this . 
18934	2	a	you don't have to lie . 
18935	3	a	i hate the fact that we have to do this together . i think we work better separately . when i am irritated and i look at you , i don't see you anymore . 
18936	2	a	right . 
18937	3	a	all i can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are . 
18938	2	a	alright . let's get started . 
18939	3	a	you know , there's no easy way to do this . i say we add 1 . 5% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it . 
18940	2	a	do you mean , like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll ? 
18941	3	a	no , we can do it during the day . it doesn't have to be that dramatic , jim . 
18942	2	a	okay . you know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options . 
18943	3	a	jim , don't take this the wrong way . are you gonna take this the wrong way ? 
18944	2	a	it's hard to tell so far . 
18945	3	a	you use your brain too much . 
18946	2	a	i'm sorry , are you advocating that i use it less ? 
18947	3	a	sometimes the smartest people don't think at all . 
18948	2	a	you just came up with that . 
18949	3	a	as i was saying it . 
18950	2	a	yeah . okay , so for the 1 . 5% increase , pro-- everyone gets a little bit . 
18951	3	a	 con-- you look like a nerd . 
18952	2	a	con-- no one gets as much as they did last year . 
18953	3	a	pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds . 
18954	2	a	pro-- no favoritism . 
18955	3	a	con-- you unzip your pants , and you find that there's a calculator down there . 
18956	2	a	i've been studying michael for years , and i've condensed what i've learned into this chart-- how michael spends his time . as you can see , we have procrastinating and distracting others , and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking . i made it bigger , so that you could see it . 
18957	4	a	i don't think we registered anywhere . we just want cash . 
18958	4	a	mm-hmm . 
18959	4	a	yeah . 
18960	4	a	okay . 
18961	4	a	is this what i've become ? materialistic ? shallow ? i feel horrible . oh look ! 'mrs . pam halpert ! ' that's the first time i've seen it in writing ! 
18962	2	a	you know , the more i think about it , the more i think we should give it to the salesmen . 
18963	3	a	that will not go over well . 
18964	2	a	i know . i just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now . 'course i know that this might come off as biased , so you know what ? let us . . . 
18965	3	a	oh , my god ! are you gonna make another pro and con list ? i'm gonna kill myself . 
18966	2	a	i'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking . 
18967	2	a	michael . 
18968	3	a	and then another--
18969	2	a	look , you have a lot of strengths . 
18970	3	a	oh , i do ? ! tell me what they are . 
18971	2	a	i think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well . 
18972	3	a	ha ! that-- i am not known for that ! 
18973	2	a	but there is a reason why i'm here ! 
18974	3	a	yes ! you went over my head to wallace ! 
18975	2	a	no , it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses , michael ! 
18976	3	a	okay . well , why don't you tell me what those are , jim ? why don't you enliven me ? 
18977	2	a	i don't think you're good at making tough decisions ! 
18978	3	a	ah . 
18979	2	a	at thinking out the options , and then stating that decision very clearly , especially when it's an unpopular decision . 
18980	3	a	okay , here's a tough decision for you . you suck ! you suck ! is that clear enough for you ? ! 
18981	2	a	but maybe i'm here for a reason , because i might have some good ideas , too . i've been sitting out there , and i've been learning a lot , and maybe i can just bring something different to the table . 
18982	3	a	okay , skippy , here we go . why don't you run yourself out there and tell them ? you call it . 
18983	3	a	 this had better be terrible . 
18984	2	a	look , you guys are smart , so i'm just leveling with you . i'm just trying to treat you like adults . 
18985	2	a	ooh , easy . that's not it at all . 
18986	2	a	really what it is , is about the money the sales staff brings into the office . 
18987	1	a	this is ridiculous ! how could he do this to us ? ! 
18988	2	a	okay , dwight , you know what ? you'd be getting the raise so--
18989	1	a	what about all these people , huh ? ! how is it fair to them ? ! 
18990	1	a	her kid needs shoes , jim ! 
18991	2	a	wow ! i'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit , so . . . 
18992	3	a	my plan-- a man-- panama . 
18993	0	a	that's not how that goes . 
18994	2	a	thank you , meredith . 
18995	3	a	alright ! let me get this clear ! does everybody want a raise ? alright , everyone wants a raise , so what we're going to do is go into here , and we will not come out until we do . 
18996	3	a	what about a raise based on merit ? 
18997	2	a	rank each person individually ? 
18998	3	a	mm-hmm . piece of cake . ryan , obviously the best . 
18999	2	a	 well , obviously . too bad he's a temp and doesn't count , so let's get started . 
19000	3	a	are you making a--
19001	2	a	nope . i'm numbering the paper . 
19002	1	a	 and jim ! 
19003	1	a	i think it was creed . 
19004	2	a	 it's going really well , actually . 
19005	2	a	 each boston baked bean represents half a percent raise . we each got 24 beans , so the idea is , you place the bean on the picture of who you think deserv-- who's that ? 
19006	3	a	toby . 
19007	2	a	he's not a part of this . you know that . 
19008	3	a	just wanted to draw a picture of him . 
19009	2	a	okay , your move . 
19010	3	a	alright ! who to pick ? who to pick ? 
19011	2	a	here we go . 
19012	3	a	i . . . will skip a turn . 
19013	2	a	okay , you're gonna still have to play that bean . you know that . 
19014	3	a	i need more time . 
19015	1	a	come on in . that's right . come in , feast your eyes . they determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces . 
19016	1	a	things were not this bad when just michael was manager . 
19017	3	a	hey , what are you guys doing in here ? 
19018	4	a	why aren't there any beans on this very old , frizzy-haired picture of me ? 
19019	4	a	jim ? 
19020	2	a	i was just trying to be unbiased . 
19021	0	a	there's no way that stanley gets more beans than me . that is ridiculous . this is how it works . 
19022	0	a	thank you ! that is exactly-- by the way , i would also like a raise . 
19023	1	a	no , i mean , what do you say to my plan ? okay . 
19024	3	a	 how you doing ? 
19025	2	a	uh , on a scale of one to ten , i'd say i'm about a four . 
19026	3	a	oh , what are you usually ? 
19027	2	a	six . you ? 
19028	3	a	usually a ten , but i'm feeling like a zero . 
19029	2	a	i mean , a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea , right ? 
19030	3	a	i know , i know . 
19031	2	a	we tried to find the fairest way to do it . 
19032	3	a	yes , we did . 
19033	2	a	i just-- what ? 
19034	3	a	um , nothing . i just . . . i used to have to do this part alone , and it was the worst . i have something i would like to give you . 
19035	2	a	 michael's my only friend left in the office . except pam . . . i think . is she still upset ? 
19036	2	a	 thank you . 
19037	3	a	you're welcome . 
19038	2	a	what's in here ? 
19039	3	a	gin . 
19040	2	a	ooh ! 
19041	3	a	 just pretend we're not here . 
19042	4	a	yeah , i mean , if it's all the same for you . 
19043	4	a	$100 now for sure . 
19044	4	a	yeah . no , no , i'll um-- the hundred . i'll just take the hundred . 
19045	4	a	how sure is this ? 
19046	4	a	the guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game . 
19047	4	a	i'm sorry . you guys have probably noticed my stomach's a little more sensitive lately . so , if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less perfume . . . and if your lunch is especially pungent , maybe have it in the break room ? 
19048	2	a	we would really appreciate it . 
19049	1	a	pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy . if she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed . it's amazing . a three ounce fetus is calling the shots . it's so bad ass . 
19050	4	a	phyllis , if you could switch to a different soap , just for a month or two ? yours is kind of perfumy . 
19051	1	a	oh , gee , i'm sorry . i guess i missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant . no ! i reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk . 
19052	4	a	i don't think i'm asking for too much . i guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace . 
19053	3	a	 what do you think ? i spent all morning on it . 
19054	2	a	it is really special . 
19055	4	a	yeah , but aren't you supposed to do that to our . . . no . it's great . 
19056	3	a	it's just a really important day for me . 
19057	2	a	well , congrats . 
19058	3	a	thanks . 
19059	2	a	believe it or not , kevin , fire crackers are in the don't column . 
19060	2	a	no . this is a fire cracker free wedding . 
19061	1	a	come on . you've got to be kidding me . 
19062	4	a	ok . all of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding . 
19063	2	a	absolutely . 'cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended . 
19064	4	a	well , we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned . 
19065	2	a	that's nice . 
19066	4	a	you know , angela , you don't have to come to the wedding . 
19067	3	a	yes she does . yes she does . we're all gonna go and we're gonna have a good time . 
19068	3	a	no . 
19069	4	a	next time we're all in this room jim and i will be married . 
19070	1	a	we'll see . 
19071	4	a	thank you , dwight . 
19072	2	a	good-bye . 
19073	4	a	see you later . 
19074	3	a	and , hey , don't embarrass me when we go to niagara . 
19075	0	a	what happens in niagara , stays in niagara . 
19076	3	a	don't . don't . don't . you stole my joke . don't steal my joke . 
19077	0	a	no . . . i didn't steal your joke . 
19078	3	a	yes . i said that yesterday . 
19079	1	a	but you can say that about anything . 
19080	3	a	dwight . . . 
19081	1	a	what happens in accounting , stays in accounting . 
19082	3	a	no . no . no . please , please . dwight , that's my joke . 
19083	1	a	it's easy . that's what i'm saying . 
19084	3	a	pam and jim's wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe . 
19085	1	a	i stole the guest list from jim's desk and i search engined every female on both sides of the family . 
19086	3	a	get out of here . 
19087	1	a	yes . 
19088	3	a	oh , my god , dwight . 
19089	1	a	for instance , pam's cousin , jocelyn webster . 
19090	3	a	there's . . . a name . 
19091	1	a	two years ago she was selling a mountain bike . 
19092	3	a	oh . well , tell me about jocelyn . 
19093	1	a	well . . . she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately . 
19094	3	a	ok . 
19095	1	a	she had a couple hundred dollars to spend , i mean , if she was able to sell her bike . 
19096	3	a	is that all you have on her ? 
19097	1	a	well , if this is in fact her because it is a very common name . 
19098	3	a	you're an idiot . 
19099	0	a	 hey , do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so i have someone to talk to ? it's like a five hour drive-ish , you know . 
19100	0	a	mmm-hmm . erin ? 
19101	0	a	not only is erin really sweet and cute . . . she smell's like my mom . 
19102	4	a	 hey , my aunt told me something neat .

19178	2	a	michael , i thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak , like , at all . because it's just going to be blood relatives , i think . 
19179	3	a	that is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives . 
19180	2	a	pretty sure everyone heard that . 
19181	3	a	didn't move my lips . 
19182	4	a	hey , mema .

19186	1	a	from quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent , while his sales down two percent . it's all in the report .

19188	1	a	that's right . it is ew . it is very ew . 
19189	4	a	oscar , kevin , this is my sister , penny . she's also my maid of honor .

19192	0	a	how did meredith get put at the young people's table ? 
19193	0	a	what ? you're kid-- that's-- you're--
19194	3	a	head table , where i belong . 
19195	1	a	it's just for family . 
19196	3	a	well , who's that one ? 
19197	1	a	isabel poreba . oh , i've got stuff on her . in 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2 . 
19198	3	a	what am i supposed to do with that , dwight ? 
19199	1	a	that's a very good record . 
19200	3	a	they have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong . i would kill with the brother stuff . it should be me . . . up there . it should be me and pete , not pete and tom . 
19201	1	a	knight rider .

19209	2	a	alright . hey , everyone . thanks for coming . 
19210	4	a	like . . . a year . 
19211	2	a	pam can't drink ? i didn't-- i shouldn't have said that . i don't know why i did . she can do whatever she wants , though she shouldn't . she shouldn't because she's an alcoholic . pam is an alcoholic . that's not true . i-- no . what we want-- the real reason is that , that pam's pregnant . 
19212	3	a	 ok . ok . hey . what i think jim is trying to say is that . . . they had an accident and you know what ? these two people , they're living together , they're having lots of consentual sex--
19213	3	a	yes . yes they were living together . yes and you know what ? you can't expect them to be careful every time . because , frankly , it's just a different sensation . 
19214	2	a	michael . 
19215	3	a	when you c-- well ? am i wrong ? they say it's not different , but it's a different sensation . 
19216	2	a	oh , my god . please . 
19217	3	a	when you use something to block-- i think everybody knows what i am talking about . it's not necessarily different for the woman--
19218	4	a	michael . 
19219	3	a	 . . . but it's different for the-- ok . ok . 
19220	4	a	michael . stop . 
19221	3	a	alright . my point is i said what i wanted to say and mema , i hope you heard every word .

19227	2	a	i can't believe it was me . 
19228	3	a	i know . i can't believe it was you , either . i actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me . 
19229	2	a	is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things ? 
19230	3	a	i have not found that to be the case . 
19231	4	a	hey , smooth guys . 
19232	2	a	i'm so sorry .

19260	3	a	ok . that's not appropriate . uncool . uncool , dwight . ok . ok . come on . let's go . 
19261	1	a	i'm just worried about the farm , ya know ? mose hates to geld the horses by himself . 
19262	3	a	dwight , dwight . shut up about the farm . it's not relatable . nobody owns a farm .

19264	1	a	i invented a device called 'burger on the go' . it allows you to obtain 6 regular size hamburgers , or 12 sliders , from a horse without killing the animal . george foreman is still considering it . sharper image is still considering it . sky mall's considering it . hammacher schlemer is still considering it . sears said , 'no' .

19402	1	a	 crap . come here you . 
19403	2	a	well we are here now , so let's just--
19404	3	a	 yes ! yes ! i have so much joy . . . in my heart . . . right now . how do i look ? 
19405	2	a	you look great . 
19406	4	a	you look great . 
19407	4	a	mm-hmm . 
19408	4	a	yes i did .

19410	4	a	yeah , i'm okay . 
19411	3	a	hey pam , did you see this ? it was on you tube . 
19412	4	a	saw it . 
19413	2	a	i bought those boat tickets the day i saw that you tube video . i knew we'd need a back-up plan . the boat was actually plan c . the church was plan b and plan a was marrying her a long , long time ago . pretty much the day i met her . 
19414	3	a	the fundamentals of business . the funda-mentals of business . 'mental' is part of the word , i have underlined it . because you're mental , if you don't have a good time . you have to enjoy it . 
19415	3	a	get out . 
19416	3	a	yes . so , it all starts with a handshake . but you can't just go right to the selling , you need 'small talk . ' what topics can you use for small talk ? 
19417	0	a	golf . 
19418	3	a	mmhm . 
19419	0	a	stock market . 
19420	3	a	mmhm . 
19421	0	a	dave matthews . 
19422	3	a	yes , what else ? 
19423	3	a	no . 
19424	3	a	yeah ! that's good ! come on up ! meredith , come up here . let's do a little something . so meredith and i have just started conversing and i will say , 'so meredith , how was your weekend , what did you do ? '
19425	3	a	all right . . . 
19426	3	a	okay , okay . god . what you people don't know about business , i could fill a book with . 
19427	3	a	what ? 
19428	3	a	 the fundamentals of business by michael scott . over one billion sold . more than the bible , i'm not surprised . chapter one . the businessman . . . 
19429	3	a	oh hi . i'm sorry , just a sec . erin , you're supposed to be the gatekeeper , do you have any idea how valuable my time is ? 
19430	3	a	do you know how creative space works ? okay i just cancelled my afternoon . 
19431	3	a	push free play til tomorrow morning . hi . sorry . crazy day . you're seeing how the sausage gets made . 
19432	3	a	come in the conference room and i will show you a finished sausage . 
19433	3	a	mmhm . 
19434	3	a	yep . 
19435	3	a	okay . 
19436	3	a	there is nothing more insulting to a great salesman , than having to listen to a bad salesman . it's like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player . 
19437	0	a	what do you think ? 
19438	1	a	i think you're right . it definitely looks suspicious . and his southern italian heritage raises some flags . 
19439	3	a	oh yup . yeah , definitely . all that paper burning up . 
19440	3	a	mmhm , i hear you . the truck . 
19441	3	a	okay , well . 
19442	3	a	do your worst . 
19443	3	a	 oh , great . 
19444	3	a	mmhm . 
19445	0	a	what happened in there ? 
19446	3	a	nothing , other than once again , i am just thankful that i am a paper salesman . 
19447	1	a	did he threaten you ? 
19448	3	a	no dwight , not everything is a threat . 
19449	0	a	mobsters are ! 
19450	3	a	there is no such things as monsters . 
19451	0	a	he drives an suv ! 
19452	1	a	i knew it ! more trunk space . or should i say , corpse space . 
19453	1	a	no , not that , by itself . but look at all the facts . he seems like a mobster . 
19454	3	a	wait , when did we start talking about the mob ? the guy was trying to sell me insurance . 
19455	0	a	all mobsters have a front , sometimes it's selling insurance , sometimes it's waste management or sanitation . 
19456	3	a	i think , he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance . 
19457	0	a	yeah , buy my insurance or i'll burn your warehouse down ! 
19458	1	a	exactly . 
19459	3	a	he did talk about a fire in the warehouse . . . and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer . 
19460	3	a	 hey , hey hey , calm down . calm down . calm down . ryan , you lived in new york , what do you think ? 
19461	3	a	okay . 
19462	3	a	um it is , grotti . 
19463	0	a	it's john gotti , you idiot ! 
19464	0	a	yeah . it's pretty close . 
19465	1	a	no i disagree . 'r' is among the most menacing of sounds . that's why they call it 'murder . ' and not 'muck-duck . '
19466	3	a	okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences . 
19467	1	a	lock your door ! 
19468	3	a	i'm not gonna lock my door . 
19469	2	a	hello ? 
19470	2	a	oscar ! uh , what is going on ? 
19471	2	a	look , we're in puerto rico , so-
19472	4	a	hey oscar . it's pam . hey . we're on our honeymoon . 
19473	4	a	unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger , you should not be calling us . 
19474	3	a	it's grotti . he's following up . 
19475	0	a	already ? this , this guy is persistent ! 
19476	3	a	 'i feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business . '
19477	1	a	that's bad . 
19478	3	a	yeah . 
19479	1	a	that's bad . 
19480	3	a	yeah . what are my options here ? do i just ignore it , or ? 
19481	0	a	yeah right ! you heard him ! he's gonna burn down the warehouse or run one of our trucks off the road . 
19482	3	a	okay , i'm calling the police . 
19483	0	a	 that is the stupidest thing you could do right now ! 
19484	1	a	he's right . cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported . 
19485	3	a	all right . 
19486	0	a	not only that , but if they find out you snitched , you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed ! 
19487	3	a	shh ! 
19488	1	a	you know what ? 
19489	3	a	that's not gonna happen . 
19490	1	a	that's an exaggeration . 
19491	0	a	that's how it works ! 
19492	3	a	what am i supposed to do here ? 
19493	0	a	when somebody threatens you , you give in right away . okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back
19494	3	a	i was thinking exactly the same thing . 
19495	1	a	no , criminals are like raccoons . okay , you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat . 
19496	0	a	dwight . . . 
19497	1	a	the only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him . trust me , i have bullied a lot of people . 
19498	3	a	i don't know , i don't know about that . 
19499	0	a	wait let's hear him out , this is interesting . 
19500	1	a	here's what we do . we meet him in a public place . ask him to lunch or something like that , some place he can't be openly violent . 
19501	0	a	okay . 
19502	1	a	let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down . that you're stubborn . that you might even be a little bit dangerous . 
19503	0	a	 i like this plan . i'd like to officially withdraw my plan . 
19504	3	a	hold on , hold on ! just-
19505	0	a	no , no , no . my plan is out ! we do this the hard way . 
19506	3	a	all right . i will meet with him , but i'm not going alone . 
19507	0	a	well you're gonna have to . dwight: we'll be right beside you . 
19508	0	a	what ? 
19509	3	a	 what are you wearing ? who's pat ? 
19510	0	a	well if i'm gonna back you up , i need a weapon without drawing suspicion , and i have to justify it somehow so , i'm a mechanic with a tire thing . 
19511	1	a	do you know how to use it ? 
19512	0	a	to change tires , no . but it's metal , i can hit somebody with it . 
19513	3	a	let's go , come on . god ! 
19514	0	a	should i change ? 
19515	1	a	you're wearing loafers ! 
19516	3	a	forget it ! forget it ! 
19517	3	a	 take that thing off the table ! please ! 
19518	0	a	well then i can't use it . i'm just gonna hide it . 
19519	1	a	hey . bathroom checks out clean . nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel . 
19520	0	a	oh ! god ! 
19521	3	a	oh my god ! 
19522	1	a	you'll never kill it that way . you want to separate the head from the thorax-
19523	3	a	guys , guys . cool it . there he is , there he is . 
19524	3	a	hello . 
19525	3	a	mr . grotti we meet again . these are my associates . 
19526	0	a	hi . 
19527	1	a	hello . 
19528	3	a	yes . 
19529	3	a	well . 
19530	3	a	okay . 
19531	1	a	oh he's not that nice . 
19532	3	a	that's not true . 
19533	0	a	hmm . very true . 
19534	3	a	okay shut up . 
19535	3	a	i will have the gabba-gool . 
19536	3	a	the gabba-gool . 
19537	0	a	 you know , gabba-gool . 
19538	3	a	i don't , i don't have to have that . 
19539	1	a	what he's trying to say is , gabba . gool . 
19540	3	a	guys , guys-
19541	3	a	that's okay . 
19542	1	a	bring him the gabba-gool ! 
19543	3	a	shh . i will have the spaghetti , with a side salad . 
19544	3	a	if the salad is on top , i send it back . 
19545	3	a	i don't think our company actually needs any more insurance . so i am out . 
19546	0	a	maybe we have a plan for you ? 
19547	0	a	yeeeeah . 
19548	0	a	yes i can . 
19549	3	a	no , no no , no . come on . i'm sorry , we're having our salad . 
19550	0	a	okay ! 
19551	3	a	hey , do you need any help ? 
19552	3	a	he's a good mechanic . 
19553	3	a	i don't . . . 
19554	1	a	he was trying to force you to decide on a policy . 
19555	3	a	okay , okay okay . 
19556	1	a	so we're choosing . . . 
19557	3	a	yep , all right . 
19558	1	a	check out dental ? 
19559	3	a	put it down . 
19560	0	a	black goes on the red . with the . . . if we . . . positive . . . mo- it being a motor drive , it's probably down . 
19561	0	a	you want to do this junior ? i didn't think so . sorry . it's kind of a long day at the . . . mechanic store . aaaah ! you got a leaky spark tube . 
19562	0	a	so your car's totaled . uh , you're just gonna want to get a refund on that . or my guy could do it . he's great . but uh , i can't do that for you . i work exclusively on motorcycles . 
19563	0	a	yeah . just thinking about how , uh , i had this car , this italian car , and i was driving it , and it kept telling me how much it needed oil , but i wouldn't give it any oil . and then , one day it exploded and it killed everyone and that's what i'm afraid of . 
19564	0	a	it was before , my tech- my technical training . 
19565	1	a	don't do it ! 
19566	0	a	do it . 
19567	1	a	don't . 
19568	0	a	just do it . 
19569	3	a	okay . 
19570	1	a	yes . 
19571	3	a	okay . 
19572	1	a	i don't understand , why would you buy a policy ? 
19573	3	a	it's just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour . 
19574	0	a	you were man enough to back down michael , i'm proud of you . 
19575	3	a	i had to make a snap decision dwight . 
19576	1	a	it wasn't a snap decision , you were sitting there for an hour . 
19577	3	a	it was a lot of snap decisions . 
19578	1	a	do you know what 'snap decision' means ? 
19579	3	a	yes ! 
19580	1	a	it means like this . 
19581	3	a	just get in the car . 
19582	2	a	hello ? 
19583	3	a	jim ? 
19584	2	a	michael ? 
19585	3	a	oh thank god . 
19586	2	a	how did you get this number ? michael , we're on a catamaran . 
19587	3	a	it wasn't easy . i had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency . i chose massive coronary , cause you told me that your dad had a bad heart . listen man , i , i got a problem , i think i'm in trouble with the mob . or a major insurance carrier . 
19588	2	a	that sounds bad . 
19589	3	a	yeah , i know and you usually can get out of stuff like this , so i'm turning to you my friend . 
19590	2	a	i'm gonna help you through it all right ? 
19591	3	a	okay ! 
19592	2	a	all you're gonna need to and- it- and then go to--
19593	3	a	jim ? are you ? 
19594	2	a	and then you'll be saved . 
19595	3	a	what ? wait , i didn't hear a thing you just said . 
19596	2	a	just and then you'll be saved . 
19597	3	a	no ! god ! i missed , i missed the important part again ! 
19598	2	a	a- ah--
19599	3	a	no ! oh my god ! 
19600	2	a	and you'll be saved . 
19601	3	a	no , jim please , repeat what you're saying ! i can't understand you ! 
19602	2	a	i at the bermuda triangle . an- m- please don't call again . 
19603	3	a	jim ? ! ? oh my god . 
19604	3	a	hey uh , question for you . i recently purchased some insurance that i can't afford given my present salary . is there anything accounting-wise i can do to sort of make it all go away ? 
19605	3	a	oh no . um . what about this cash for clunkers thing ? 
19606	3	a	all right . well , it was a thought . thanks . 
19607	1	a	we have let michael down , and it's 85 percent your fault . 
19608	0	a	he's alive . so you're welcome . 
19609	1	a	not on the inside he's not . look at his life ! broke ! living in fear ! no friends , dead end job . 
19610	0	a	yeah , some of that existed before . 
19611	1	a	not the living in fear , that's new . 
19612	0	a	you're right , that is new . 
19613	1	a	yes . he's got to stand up to this mafia guy . 
19614	0	a	well i don't see that happening . 
19615	1	a	me neither . not the way things are now . but what if michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy ? 
19616	0	a	are you saying-
19617	1	a	yeah . . . 
19618	0	a	that we surgically remove the fear center from michael's brain ? 
19619	1	a	what is wrong with you ? i am talking about convincing michael that the guy's not mafia ! 
19620	0	a	that seems a little far-fetched . 
19621	1	a	well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown ? and that happened . 
19622	1	a	michael . incredible news . grotti is clean . 
19623	3	a	no . he's not . he's just good . nothing sticks to him . you still don't understand how this works . 
19624	0	a	no , michael . what we're trying to say is , we made a mistake assuming he was mafia . i have a buddy who's a fed , and we did a background check on the guy . his background is perfectly clean . 
19625	1	a	it's true , he's clean . i have a couple of friends still on the force . checked with them . ran his fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take . turns out he's a totally lovely guy . sweetest guy on the force really . 
19626	0	a	class act . boy scout . 
19627	3	a	but grotti acts like he's mafia though . 
19628	0	a	he's trying to intimidate you to close sales . he's just a pushy salesman . 
19629	1	a	and he made us all look like chumps ! 
19630	3	a	if there is one thing i hate more than the mafia it is a liar . i wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars . bury them in my yard . and i wouldn't tell the cops a thing . not that i would be lying per se . but i would just get really quiet , all of a sudden . 
19631	3	a	this is scott . 
19632	3	a	oh really ? is that supposed to scare me ? 
19633	3	a	well you thought wrong . because i am not pleased . i'm actually kind of po'd . 
19634	3	a	i think you know exactly why , because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance . 
19635	3	a	i think you knew exactly what you were doing . and frankly i think you were being a total and utter jerk . 
19636	0	a	whoa . okay . 
19637	3	a	you suck ! 
19638	1	a	okay that's-
19639	3	a	and i'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance . 
19640	1	a	that's good , let's wrap it up . 
19641	3	a	how about that ? the only person that actually needs insurance is you , if you show your face around here again , got it ? 
19642	3	a	doubt it . 
19643	3	a	what a tool . what ? 
19644	0	a	next time you look in the mirror , you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia ! 
19645	3	a	no . what do you mean ? 
19646	1	a	we just told you he wasn't mafia , so you wouldn't be scared . 
19647	3	a	what ? 
19648	1	a	you successfully backed down the mob ! 
19649	0	a	you made the mafia apologize to you ! you made the mafia be polite ! 
19650	3	a	oh man . i should be mad at you guys . but i'm not . 
19651	3	a	so i looked him in the eye and i said , 'not today grotti , not today . and not tomorrow , and not the next day . or the day after that . and you can tell all your friends that if i see them , then they're already dead . ' i said something like that . 
19652	1	a	very close . 
19653	3	a	erin ? 
19654	3	a	coffee ? 
19655	3	a	not from the kitchen . stop and shop . if it's not stop and shop , i send it back . 
19656	3	a	large . if it's a medium i send it back . if it's an extra large i send it back . 
19657	3	a	go . any questions ? 
19658	4	a	 are you kidding me ? 
19659	4	a	listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that , and i really can't handle the fact that you're calling us here ! 
19660	4	a	oh i will . i will kevin . i will make that my top priority . 
19661	2	a	it was . 
19662	4	a	it really was . 
19663	2	a	really was . 
19664	2	a	puerto rico was awesome . 
19665	4	a	oh my gosh . the honeymoon was great . we met this other couple at the resort , frank and benny . we hung out with them a lot . 
19666	2	a	 frank and beans . always makes her laugh . 
19667	4	a	 frank and beans ! 
19668	3	a	is there someone there ? who is there ? i hear voices , is somebody there ? 
19669	1	a	yeah !

19671	1	a	its jim and pam , michael . 
19672	3	a	 it is ? 
19673	1	a	yeah . . . 
19674	3	a	they're back ? oh ! oh ! oh , pam ! 
19675	2	a	nope . 
19676	3	a	and oh , jim . . . 
19677	4	a	hi , michael . 
19678	3	a	oh , i haven't see you since my accident that i had when i fell- i fell into the pool of acid , eyes first . blind guy . 
19679	3	a	blind-guy mcsqueezy . how do i describe it ? it is a character i've been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble . the women in my improve class absolutely hate him . 
19680	4	a	some candy . 
19681	4	a	that's it . 
19682	4	a	it's good to be home . 
19683	1	a	this conversation has two items on the agenda . 
19684	2	a	do we have a conversation scheduled ? 
19685	1	a	number one , do not leave your things on my desk . it's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you . i don't care how high they promote you , which brings me to item number two . . . i never formally congratulated you on your promotion , so i'd just like to say . . . con-quack-ulations ! 
19686	2	a	wow , that's . . . really thoughtful of you , dwight , thank you . 
19687	1	a	 you're welcome ! 
19688	1	a	i inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard . now i can observe jim , trap jim , and destroy jim , just like in the bavarian fairy tale . only this time , the mallard skins the toad alive . and of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the kaiser thing . 
19689	1	a	i'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years . 
19690	2	a	it's a real handsome duck . 
19691	1	a	mallard . okay , i'll get out of your hair . 
19692	4	a	hey ! 
19693	4	a	uh , we brought back some puerto rican candy . 
19694	4	a	awesome ! i'll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it . 
19695	4	a	 i think it'll be okay . 
19696	4	a	great .

19758	4	a	yeah , but i mean , if you really like this person , then you should see where it goes . 
19759	3	a	you want me to be happy ? 
19760	4	a	of course . 
19761	3	a	part of the problem is , she is the mother of a close friend of mine . 
19762	4	a	oh . 
19763	3	a	more than a friend , a co-worker . 
19764	4	a	oh ! gossip , who is it ? who is it ? who is it , michael ? . . . who ?

19821	4	a	shut up oscar . what is wrong with all of you , he is sleeping with my mother ! 
19822	1	a	i don't think there's a whole lot of sleeping going on . 
19823	3	a	let's get back to the matter at hand . 
19824	4	a	whatever , you know , sleep with my mom , sleep with everybody's mom . . . 
19825	3	a	no , no , no . . . no , no . . . 
19826	3	a	i don't like the tone here . . . this is a place of business , you are to listen to others , you are to give others respect , and you are to keep your personal issues out of it . 
19827	4	a	uhh , huh , ho . . . oooh my god , you are ridiculous ! 
19828	3	a	do not talk to me that way ! i am your boss and i may someday be your father , so get out .

19841	3	a	 hey toby , could i talk to you for a minute ? 
19842	3	a	um , i just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was . . . uncalled for , i'm sorry . 
19843	3	a	can i sit down for a second ? 
19844	3	a	this is gonna sound weird , but i think i may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole pam situation . 
19845	3	a	she brought it into the work place so i feel like it has to be dealt with here . 
19846	3	a	really ? would you do that ?

19851	4	a	 oh , would that make you feel better ? 
19852	3	a	i don't . . . um . . . i can't hear your conversation . 
19853	4	a	you can tell michael that i'm not leaving . 
19854	3	a	yeah , yeah , yeah-okay . . . you're a jackass . hey , hey , you know what ? you're just as stubborn as your mother , when you don't wanna do something you just don't do it . 
19855	4	a	michael , you're just her rebound ! 
19856	3	a	you were right jim , shoulda listened to you , should never have told her . 
19857	4	a	 what ! you knew ? 
19858	2	a	barely , i . . . i don't have all the facts . frank and bean . . . 
19859	3	a	 okay , do you want me to stop seeing your mom ? is that how we're gonna get past this ? cause , i will . 
19860	4	a	mmmmm , yes ! 
19861	3	a	well , that is not gonna happen ! 
19862	4	a	then why'd you even offer ! ? 
19863	3	a	because i assumed that you want me to be happy because i want you to be happy . 
19864	4	a	michael , let me make this very easy for you , i could give a sh about your happiness ! stop dating my mother ! 
19865	3	a	you know what ? i'm gonna start dating her even harder .

19993	3	a	erin , do we have any of those clips that hold paper together ?

19997	3	a	ok . 
19998	1	a	michael ? 
19999	3	a	yes . 
20000	1	a	a carp is both a fish and a term for complaing . they're mocking you with wordplay . 
20001	3	a	i can name pixar movies , too . toy story . 
20002	1	a	michael , flounder is both a kind of fish and -
20003	3	a	i know what a flounder is . 
20004	3	a	i'm not usually the butt of the joke . i'm usually the face of the joke . i wish jim had fallen into that pond and he'd have to put on my suit and it'd be too short and he'd look . . . damn it ! he'd still look good . 
20005	3	a	the most fundamental thing about sensitivity training is that you cannot make fun of a person for something or some action that they have done that they regret . show of hands- who has been 'koi-ponded' ? who here's been the butt of a joke that has gone too far ? phyllis ? 
20006	3	a	uh . . . 
20007	3	a	you never said anything . 
20008	3	a	well , it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying , 'stop because i want you to stop' or stop as in 'stop . you're making me laugh so hard . what you're doing is so funny . you are on a roll . i am busting a gut . stop ! '
20009	1	a	i don't want people making fun of my nose . 
20010	3	a	your nose ? 
20011	1	a	it's too small .

20016	3	a	ok . that's to broad . it's gotta be something else . how 'bout your stomach ? yeah ? meredith ? 
20017	3	a	ok . fine . come on up here . write it yourself . and don't sign your name to it . and nobody look . everybody look away . look away . 
20018	3	a	ok . 
20019	0	a	that is our sales pitch and we are stickin' to it . 
20020	0	a	well-
20021	4	a	oh- thank you . 
20022	4	a	well , you know .

20028	4	a	and i'll just watch him . 
20029	4	a	yes . 
20030	0	a	yeah . we are thrilled . 
20031	4	a	mmm-hmm . 
20032	0	a	in fact , we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches . wasn't that fun , honey ? 
20033	4	a	it was , sweetie . 
20034	0	a	yeah . on clearview avenue . 
20035	0	a	yeah . 
20036	3	a	it's a fish . 
20037	3	a	it could've died of natural causes . so . . . 
20038	3	a	do not mock , oscar . do not mock . how much do they want ? 
20039	3	a	what ? no . i could get a fish for a 5 cent worm . 
20040	2	a	ok . great meeting , everybody . that's it . 
20041	3	a	no , no . 
20042	1	a	thank you . 
20043	3	a	no . we are not done here . this-
20044	0	a	one of the baby books suggets the best birthing posture is on all fours , like an animal . i just wish i had a special telephone so i could find out exactly wht the little soy bean wants . right ? hey , little soy bean . what do you want ? right . how do- it- i felt it kick ! 
20045	0	a	oh , my gosh . like a little magical foot just high-fived me . 
20046	4	a	yeah , well , that'll happen . 
20047	0	a	oh , my gosh . it's like he's trying to say , 'i love you , too , daddy' . i love you , too . 
20048	4	a	sometimes we're so excited we forget where we are . like at a business meeting . 
20049	0	a	message received , little soy bean . 
20050	2	a	i think you just gotta ride this one out , man . 
20051	3	a	no , jim . you don't understand . things like this don't just die . kids in high school still call me 'ponytail' . 
20052	2	a	no , they don't . 
20053	3	a	yes , they do , jim . because of the time i got my ponytail stuck in the power trail . 
20054	2	a	maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away . 
20055	3	a	i want to make fun of you right now . 
20056	2	a	really ? do it . i am a big , stupid goofball . 
20057	3	a	no . don't do that . you're not . you're not stupid . 
20058	2	a	see ? 
20059	3	a	oh , my god . 
20060	3	a	hey . i- i just wanna say that i cannot believe that i walked into a koi pond . i mean , seriously . walk much ? oh . i should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that i go to . 
20061	3	a	well , you know what ? you're right , phyllis , but i've been there before . i've seen that pond . this is the thing , i am a world class moron . that's the problem . 
20062	1	a	michael , please . stop it now . you're embarrassing yourself . 
20063	3	a	hey . who wants to watch michael's pond dive ? my roommate's friend is the night janitor over there . he swiped the security tape for me and he's bringing it over . 
20064	2	a	mm . . . i'm , know what ? maybe we should go easy on michael , guys . you know , you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training , so . . . 
20065	0	a	well , that went pretty well . 
20066	4	a	yeah , i guess . 
20067	0	a	we got a maybe . it was our first maybe . going by the nard dog curve , i'd say we nailed it . 
20068	4	a	if i'm being completely honest , i could've done without the belly kiss . 
20069	0	a	you know what ? i'm sorry . 'cause in that moment i knew i was kissing your belly too much . 
20070	4	a	yeah . way too much . 
20071	0	a	yeah . 
20072	4	a	i mean , what the hell was that ? 
20073	0	a	what the heck was that ? 
20074	4	a	when you cried ?

20088	2	a	that will inevitably lead to mocking . so . . . 
20089	3	a	is this the tape of me falling ? 
20090	2	a	guys . michael can't handle this and as your boss i'm saying we're not watching it .

20102	2	a	i didn't ask you . would you like to talk ? 
20103	1	a	judas . 
20104	1	a	jim is my enemy . but it turns out that jim is also his own worst enemy . and the enemy of my enemy is my friend . so , jim is actually my friend . but . . . because he is his own worst enemy , the enemy of my friend is my enemy . so , actually jim is my enemy . but-
20105	2	a	i should've grabbed you . i'm sorry . look , i thought i could've done today's sales call alone . i mean , i may never be as good a salesman as you are , but i at least need the chance to do the job .

20247	4	a	aww--
20248	3	a	i literally-- i put no thought into the wrapping at all . might as well of been toilet paper . 
20249	3	a	that's just an arbitrary title . 
20250	2	a	penny for your thoughts . 
20251	2	a	wow . 
20252	4	a	that's amazing . 
20253	3	a	it's not amazing . . . at all . it's sort of weird that i went and did that . and now your wish won't come true , so that blows . 
20254	3	a	oh that i plagiarized i think . 
20255	2	a	 shel silverstein . 
20256	4	a	yeah . 
20257	4	a	that's really nice michael . 
20258	3	a	i think it sucks . 
20259	3	a	well , that's because you and i have very different tastes and you like lame things . it's a generational-- sort of gap between us . 
20260	4	a	home run michael . 
20261	2	a	you set the bar so high . 
20262	3	a	that was a bunt .

20273	4	a	okay , weirdo . come on . it's time for cake . 
20274	3	a	honestly , for a long time i thought i was going to grow old with holly . and then i met helene . and she is great and she already knows and has done everything that i have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it . but , i think i want to do those things myself . 
20275	4	a	cakes really good . 
20276	3	a	finish your cake , helene . 
20277	3	a	i want you to enjoy that cake because i have something terrible i need to tell you . i want you to enjoy your cake before i tell you this terrible , terrible thing . 
20278	3	a	helene i think you're a wonderful person and i-- god-- i've enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much . but i have to consider pam's feelings as a friend and a co-worker i can not in good conscience continue to date you , when i know what this is doing to her . 
20279	4	a	michael . michael , it's okay . 
20280	3	a	no it's not . 
20281	4	a	i know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to , but you obviously make my mom very happy . and that makes me happy . 
20282	3	a	wow . that just-- you've really grown . 
20283	4	a	well--

20349	3	a	okay . 
20350	2	a	and i don't support her choice to hit you . 
20351	3	a	i don't either . 
20352	2	a	but at the same time she looks crazy and i do understand her reasoning . 
20353	3	a	mmm-hmm . i know .

20355	3	a	you gotta do something--

20386	2	a	feel better ? 
20387	4	a	no . you were right . 
20388	1	a	 wait , why are you limping ? 
20389	3	a	i don't know . 
20390	1	a	let's get some raw meat on that face . i got a chicken in the freezer upstairs . 
20391	3	a	ahh . . . 
20392	1	a	good , good . keep it on there for another five minutes . just let the swelling go down . 
20393	3	a	oh thank you . thanks . i owe you one dwight . 
20394	1	a	fire jim . 
20395	3	a	no . 
20396	1	a	i'm cashing in the favor . fire him . 
20397	3	a	what are you talking about--
20398	1	a	do it . promote me . tri-managers . 
20399	3	a	forget that . 
20400	1	a	can i have an office ? 
20401	3	a	no . 
20402	1	a	you know what you can keep your stupid favor . it's worthless . and this is my dinner on your face . i'm keeping it . 
20403	3	a	 oh that feels better . 
20404	1	a	 got you ! broken arm ! boom boom boom ! broken nose ! boom boom boom boom ! broken nose ! boom ! ha , gonna flip you ! 
20405	2	a	once a year dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate . . . because as we all know , the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change . 
20406	2	a	ok , so there's no defense for that , good to know . 
20407	1	a	no , there is a defense for that . let me demonstrate . someone attack me . kevin , go ! 
20408	1	a	false . i did choke you with your shoelace . now come at me ! 
20409	2	a	ok , with all due respect to everyone here , i think the most worthy opponent of you is you . 
20410	1	a	that is correct . unless there happened to be measles present . 
20411	2	a	so let's just say that dwight has come at you with the throat punch . now how would you , dwight , defend against it ? 
20412	1	a	easy . allow me to demonstrate . i am attacking myself with a throat punch . here it comes . block . grasp wrist as such . 
20413	2	a	and what if he comes at you with the other hand , because he does have two . 
20414	1	a	good point . second , throat punch , absorb the blow . groin punch , hip block , elbow to the gut . uh oh , up to the nose . no , you're not . ow ! oh ! 
20415	2	a	oh my god , he's making you look like such a fool . 
20416	1	a	he really is , but not for long . ow ! instep , oh , not again . you let go , you let go . oh , you're right , i can't hold on . 
20417	2	a	you two are so evenly matched i don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand . 
20418	1	a	the important thing to remember jim . . . we always have what is called the element of surprise . 
20419	3	a	but i would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy . 
20420	0	a	i did stand up comedy once . 
20421	3	a	you did ? 
20422	0	a	yeah , i killed . 
20423	3	a	that sounds like it was hilarious . 
20424	0	a	it was hilarious . 
20425	1	a	michael ? 
20426	3	a	yes ? 
20427	1	a	what is the meaning of this email that everyone got ? 
20428	3	a	you'll have to be more specific dwight , i get like eight emails a day . 
20429	1	a	this one , from david wallace to all dunder mifflin . 
20430	3	a	woo hoo , shout out ! 
20431	1	a	hello everyone i am sure you have seen the item in the journal . i just want to stress that it's all conjecture . if there's any concrete news you will know asap . 
20432	3	a	erin , do we have the journal ? 
20433	3	a	did you ? 
20434	4	a	michael , he means the wall street journal online . 
20435	3	a	oh , the wall . 
20436	3	a	it's $1 . 99 to finish the article . i wonder what it was going to say ? 
20437	2	a	are you serious ? 
20438	0	a	i got it , i got it . . . oh , tuna beat me to it . 
20439	3	a	no , no , that doesn't make any sense . 
20440	3	a	oh , that sounds awful . 
20441	3	a	oh god . well , that's an interesting theory . 
20442	1	a	you know what ? you can all have jobs at schrute farms as human scarecrows . it doesn't pay much and you can't unionize . 
20443	3	a	ah , well maybe you should spy on him . oh my god , wouldn't that be hilarious ! 
20444	3	a	ok , ok . good . i'll catch you on the flippity flip . bye . he's busy , he'll call me back when he's free . 
20445	3	a	no , i'm just poopin' . you know how i be . 
20446	3	a	crazy world . lotta smells . 
20447	0	a	i like erin . there , i said it . i was kinda hoping she would ask me out , but things have not panned out on that front , so . . . it is time for the nard dog to take matters into his own paws . 
20448	2	a	 we have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen . 
20449	3	a	ok , we need some sort of distraction for everybody . anything new on youtube ? doesn't even need to be good . oh god , i can't think , need more mullins . 
20450	2	a	listen , wallace said these were just rumors , right ? so we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine . so if we just go on with our work , you and me , they'll follow along . 
20451	3	a	monkey see , monkey do . 
20452	2	a	that's it . 
20453	3	a	monkey pee all over you . 
20454	2	a	that rhymes , so what have we on the docket today ? 
20455	3	a	we have a monthly staff meeting
20456	2	a	alright , let's conference room it up ! here's the deal guys . there is no new information as of yet , so i suggest we all just keep working . 
20457	2	a	sure i'm a little nervous , but doing our work will make us feel better . i only slack off when things are good . 
20458	2	a	customers have to use the coupon code from the website . and as of now there is no differentiation between the letter o and the zero , but we are working on that . stay tuned for that . 
20459	1	a	 he needs me . seat saved infinity . 
20460	2	a	ok , great . 
20461	3	a	 what ? oh my god ! there has been a murder . there's been a murder in savannah . 
20462	3	a	games have the power to distract people from stressful situations . battleship got me through my parents' divorce . operation got me through my vasectomy , i . e . , my operation . i don't think i would have been able to endure my breakup with holly had it not been for toss across . 
20463	3	a	it is so much fun . everybody plays a character , we go around the room , we try to figure out who did it . . . 
20464	2	a	hey , i am wondering if this is a , uh , terrible idea . 
20465	3	a	this is my call jim , big picture stuff , it's about murder . 
20466	2	a	i thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this . 
20467	3	a	tube city , you owe me one . 
20468	2	a	co-managing is a give and take . you have to pick your battles . one of the battles that i picked was to stop michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them . he was going to call it tube city . so , yes , i do owe him one . 
20469	3	a	there will be food . you leave , you do not get food . 
20470	3	a	sandwich platters . 
20471	3	a	baby carrots . 
20472	3	a	ok , use your imaginations . 
20473	0	a	who'd you get ? 
20474	0	a	oooooo , saucy . 
20475	0	a	nathaniel nutmeg , the local bartender and nellie's brother . 
20476	3	a	it's not scary . 
20477	4	a	who are you ? 
20478	3	a	well how do you think i feel ? i mean i have to play caleb crawdad , handsome playboy . every night , a different woman . being oogled . having to hug and kiss and spoon , i make them feel beautiful . 
20479	3	a	 well , well , well . what is this contraption , i do declare ? 
20480	3	a	who's michael ? i'm caleb crawdad , i do declare . 
20481	3	a	that is the way southern people talk . 
20482	2	a	and what designing woman are you basing that on ? 
20483	3	a	delta burke , i do declare . now , shall we get to the mystery ? 
20484	4	a	i'll go . my name is deborah u . tante . deb for short . 
20485	0	a	that's clever , debutante . 
20486	4	a	bill bourbon was my uncle . i would have never hurt him any more than i'd hurt a june bug . 
20487	4	a	i do not . 
20488	0	a	well , you do actually . you've got this kinda like florida panhandle thing going , whereas what you really want is more of a savannah accent , which is more like molasses just sorta spillin' out of your mouth . 
20489	0	a	uh , not familiar , what province is he from ? 
20490	1	a	wait a minute , wait a minute . i'm the butler . you were listening in on that ? you rich people . you think you can do whatever you want to the servant class ! 
20491	3	a	no , no , no . don't turn this into a political thing . 
20492	1	a	i will poison your food . 
20493	0	a	i reckon i got something to say to miss beatrix bourbon , if'n she don't mind . 
20494	3	a	oooooo , doggie , we got a party now ! 
20495	3	a	i do believe that the game is a big hit . people are really diving into their characters . 
20496	3	a	 sir , there has been a murder , and you are a suspect . 
20497	3	a	very good , very good . now , no one was there in the wine cellar . 
20498	0	a	 hey there young lady . 
20499	0	a	i would be remiss if i did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend . 
20500	0	a	alright , a plan it is . 
20501	1	a	voodoo mama juju , explain your dalliance with the dark arts . 
20502	1	a	i know you did it ! 
20503	1	a	i know she didn't do it . it's never the person you most suspect . it's also never the person you least suspect , since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most . therefore i know the killer to be phyllis , aka beatrix bourbon , the person i most medium suspect . 
20504	0	a	i'm a little worried i might have asked out naughty nellie and not erin . which would be a whole lot less appealing , because naughty nellie says yes to everyone . and she might be a murderer . 
20505	3	a	 whoa . what's this strange yankee accent coming out of your mouth , son ? this here's savannah . 
20506	2	a	ok , i'm going back to work . 
20507	3	a	no no no no no no no . i'm going to skip forward to a relevant clue . here we go . 
20508	3	a	 are you going to believe that ? that is a mis- that's a misdirection . we still don't know who the murderer is . nellie nutmeg , come back in here . i can't do this myself . voodoo mama juju . . . what am i gonna do ? 
20509	2	a	ok , so corporate is still in their meeting . 
20510	2	a	alright guys , it's a work day and you guys work here , so let's go do some work . 
20511	2	a	 oh , hey , michael . listen , i brought up those sales targets . do you want to-
20512	3	a	 i do believe you have me mistaken , my name is caleb crawdad . y'all skedaddled way too soon . we need to reopen this case . 
20513	2	a	no , you're not reopening the case . the case is closed . 
20514	3	a	no it ain't . 
20515	1	a	frankly , i'm not surprised . a lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns . 
20516	0	a	just thinking about weekend at bernie's . it's funny , the guy's dead the whole time . 
20517	0	a	speaking of weekends , you excited about our date this weekend ? 
20518	0	a	yeah , ok . 
20519	0	a	 well , finest steakhouse in all savannah . 
20520	0	a	did you mean a real date ? 
20521	0	a	totally . . . not . 
20522	1	a	you're sure it was water , it couldn't have been acid ? 
20523	3	a	i already declared you , it was too dark to tell . 
20524	1	a	stop playing games with me , crawdad . 
20525	3	a	this is not a game , this is my life . you are out of order , sir . 
20526	1	a	answer me . 
20527	3	a	you are out of order . 
20528	1	a	you are out of order . 
20529	3	a	you are-
20530	4	a	i think michael may have snapped . 
20531	2	a	or maybe he's just stuck in character . 
20532	4	a	well , which is worse ? snapped or stuck ? 
20533	2	a	both . they're both worse . 
20534	2	a	it's going to be alright . we're a good company , we'll figure this out . we're not going under . 
20535	4	a	jim , what if we both lose our jobs ? i'm trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine , and i can't think of one . 
20536	3	a	 deb , what in the world - do you have the vapors ? 
20537	2	a	michael , not now . 
20538	3	a	can't wait , we have to get you to our witch doctor right now . come on . come on . 
20539	4	a	i should just go . where to now caleb ? 
20540	3	a	to mama juju boo boo . 
20541	2	a	michael , can i . . . ok , i'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why . 
20542	3	a	because this is the recreation of a crime scene . 
20543	1	a	hey shut up . you're dead . 
20544	2	a	michael , can i talk to you in your office ? 
20545	3	a	no michael here , my name is-

20548	3	a	no , you shut up . they need this game , jim . let us have this stupid little game , alright ? 
20549	3	a	 oh , you startled me . my stars , my heart nearly leapt out of my chest . what can i do you for ? 
20550	3	a	detective wallace ? 
20551	3	a	aw , shucks , tell him i'm not here . 
20552	3	a	no , i only answer to detective wallace 'cause i got a warm body in the other room . 
20553	2	a	i'll take it . 
20554	2	a	hey david . 
20555	2	a	oh , ok . 
20556	2	a	sure . oh , you know , while i have you . . . today i was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain , and it would actually be a big account and i wanted to-
20557	2	a	ok . 
20558	2	a	see ya . 
20559	4	a	 what's the news ? 
20560	2	a	nothing yet .

20565	1	a	oh , this could be a juicy one . 
20566	3	a	get in there ! 
20567	3	a	there has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue . my little heart can barely take it no more . today is the hardest i have worked in a long , long time . 
20568	0	a	 i didn't do it ! 
20569	1	a	ok , everybody just calm down . 
20570	0	a	i am calm . 
20571	3	a	on the count of three we're all going to put down our guns .

20573	3	a	we'll put down our weaponry on the count of three , you ready ? 
20574	1	a	ok , i'm ready . 
20575	3	a	one , two , three . . 
20576	2	a	andy revealed himself to be a double agent . at which point dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent . and then michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent . oh , and it is 6:00 . 
20577	2	a	 really ? 
20578	4	a	 it wasn't me . i'm not goin' down for this ! 
20579	2	a	yeah , i want to go home . 
20580	4	a	get the keys out of my purse , start the car . 
20581	1	a	bow down before recyclops . 
20582	2	a	five years ago , corporate said we had to start a recycling program for earth day so dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named recyclops . 
20583	1	a	happy earth day , everyone . i'm recyclops . did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter ? 
20584	2	a	the next year he really stepped things up . 
20585	1	a	who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin ? 
20586	2	a	a year after that recylcops really began to take shape . 
20587	1	a	recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns . 
20588	2	a	then tragedy struck recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing . . . i can't remember . 
20589	1	a	recyclops will have his revenge . 
20590	2	a	i think this was also the year he renounced earth day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved . 
20591	4	a	oh my god , you guys , look . it's recyclops . 
20592	1	a	recyclops destroys ! 
20593	1	a	yes . 
20594	1	a	polluticorn wishes . 
20595	0	a	that's aerosol spray . it's terrible for the environment . 
20596	1	a	humans are terrible for the environment . 
20597	4	a	the thing i like most about recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child . 
20598	2	a	mmm . 
20599	4	a	a world where you truly can be anything you want . 
20600	2	a	god bless you , recyclops . and your cold robot heart . 
20601	3	a	 ok . ok . how 'bout this ? 
20602	4	a	that's great . 
20603	3	a	i want it to be better than 'great' , pam . how 'bout i remain seated . . . and i just do a little bit of a nod . sort of a humble thing . 
20604	4	a	sure . 
20605	3	a	nope . then my face is down . they can't see my face . 
20606	0	a	 ladies and gentlemen from scranton , pennsylvania , please welcome michael 'the machine' scott . 
20607	4	a	don't do the twirl . 
20608	1	a	the twirl sucks .

20610	3	a	ok . obviously i'm not going to do the twirl . i only did it because i nailed the wave . 
20611	3	a	i am not going to do the twirl . alright ? it's not even a twirl , it's a spin . i might do the spin . 
20612	3	a	ok , oscar , i don't need the whole enchilada just the bullet points . 
20613	3	a	well , could you condense it please ? 
20614	3	a	it's not a limo . it's a town car . town cars are actually better , though . better torque . better handling . 
20615	3	a	they sent a limo . 
20616	3	a	town cars suck . town car is something that a company sends when they're in trouble . a limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration . and in this case i think we are celebrating me . 
20617	3	a	 oh , wait . wait . wow . wow ! oh , no way . look at that . 
20618	1	a	what kind of mileage does this baby get ? 
20619	3	a	hate to break it to you oscar but some of us like boobs .

20628	3	a	definitely .

20636	2	a	could go either way . 
20637	2	a	maybe we should just wait and find out . 
20638	2	a	ok . 
20639	2	a	nah . might as well do it now . 
20640	0	a	michael , what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting ? are you just gonna wave , or what ?

20684	2	a	i am just as much of a boss as michael and i can do anything that michael can do . alright ? who here believes that i have as much power as michael ? 
20685	4	a	i forgot i have to support him no matter what . close one . 
20686	0	a	you should get up and say something . you've got to be true to what's in there . don't be a wuss . 
20687	0	a	i've always been the guy who can rally other people to rebel . in high school i organized a walk out over standardized testing . got over 500 students to just skip the sats . at the last second i chickened out , took it anyway , got a 1220 , always regretted it . i feel lachrymose . 
20688	3	a	hey , hey , hey . i'm sorry . these are not criminals . they are nice . they invited me to come here today . they invited me to their hospitality suite where i had free food and it was delicious . get this . know how nice they are ? the sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in scranton . that's -

20707	3	a	wow . things are really picking up . 
20708	3	a	what ?

20710	3	a	we tell them the plan , right ? 
20711	3	a	here's what we're gonna do . the 45 day thing that i outlined , we go with that . day 45 , company saved . day 44 , go . what do we got ? we have 15 minutes . 
20712	3	a	just whatever comes to mind . shout it out . 
20713	3	a	i am the guy who roused that crowd . 
20714	3	a	got them on their feet . 
20715	3	a	they were so happy down there . 
20716	3	a	ok . alright . well , i know a guy . this mexican guy . he is a math whiz . he knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and i am going to call in a little favor . 
20717	3	a	well , i'm texting him , so . 
20718	3	a	it's done . 
20719	2	a	i think this is really gonna help . if you could just hold up here one second . hey , guys . quick announcement . if i could just have everyone's attention . i just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people . 
20720	2	a	let me show you what i mean . your new office . how great is that , right ? for a job well done . well , not done .

20732	3	a	uh , i'm not a moron . time after time my branch leads in sales . i have personally won over 17 dundie awards . so , i am not a moron and i am just trying to help , you know ? so . . . you're the moron .

20781	3	a	yeah , you know what , that actually might make me feel better . i'm not in this for the trophies , but . . . 
20782	2	a	you're not in it at all , because you can't be employee of the month , you're a manager . 
20783	3	a	well , technically , i'm a co-manager , and i barely have any responsibilities , but i work hard , i love this company , and for those reasons , i think i would make a good employee of the month . 
20784	2	a	it would look bad . sorry . 
20785	3	a	it would look good , on my mantle . 
20786	0	a	jim's talking to michael right now . they totally went for our idea ! 
20787	1	a	yeah ! your idea .

20792	4	a	michael , why did you promise that ? 
20793	3	a	to change lives . 
20794	4	a	no michael , why would you promise that ? 
20795	3	a	yeah , okay . call the school , cancel . i can't go through with this . 
20796	4	a	michael , this is a terrible terrible thing you've done . 
20797	3	a	well . . . 
20798	4	a	it's terrible . 
20799	3	a	no . 
20800	4	a	just terrible . and the longer you put it off , the worse it's going to get . 
20801	3	a	just tell me it is going to be okay , all right ? 
20802	4	a	no ! 
20803	3	a	i'm not a bad person , i bring good news . like when i promised those kids i'd pay for college . okay , all right . 
20804	4	a	you have to tell them . 
20805	3	a	would you come with me ? you know , like old times , instead of . . . 
20806	4	a	it's fine . erin , you're going to go . and you're going to make sure michael tells the truth . 
20807	3	a	agh , god , you know what , could this day get any worse ? 
20808	1	a	hey jimmy , what's up ? 
20809	2	a	not much . 
20810	1	a	cool . very cool . i bet if you tried , you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office . 
20811	2	a	 thanks dwight . 
20812	1	a	that laugh is so infectious . 
20813	2	a	you're creeping me out . i'm gonna go . 
20814	1	a	i didn't mean any of those things i just said . and you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole employee of the month situation in the bud . make it about the work . 
20815	2	a	let me guess , you think you should get it . 
20816	1	a	this encompasses all available data . hours , tardiness , unconfirmed sick days , participation . everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency . also , this should be accompanied by a monetary prize . 
20817	2	a	well , in an ideal world . . . 
20818	1	a	in an ideal world , i would have all ten fingers on my left hand , so my right hand could just be a fist for punching . 
20819	2	a	okay , if it's all the same to you , i'm just going to take away 'survival skills' and 'self-defense . '
20820	1	a	i'm going to run this by toby and accounting and have him assemble the data . 
20821	2	a	that's okay , i'll do it . 
20822	3	a	hey , mikela lasker , how are you ? 
20823	3	a	good to see you . where's your saxaphone ? 
20824	3	a	eigth grade graduation , she gave a rendition of when the saints go marching in that would blow your freaking mind . 
20825	3	a	well , you didn't even hear it . 
20826	3	a	oh , good . 
20827	3	a	sure . 
20828	3	a	oh , yeah . 
20829	3	a	no , not at all . nope , come on . 
20830	3	a	oh , you know what ? you know what ? i shouldn't go in there . i'm pretty busy , i should just . . . 
20831	3	a	oh . 
20832	3	a	wow ! 
20833	1	a	hey , so jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-
20834	1	a	so jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole employee of the month thing . 
20835	1	a	he thought you were doing an incredible job last month . 
20836	1	a	you seem suprised . 
20837	1	a	hey buddy , so every-
20838	1	a	five minutes ahead of schedule . right on schedule . 
20839	3	a	 oh , god . oh , god . 
20840	2	a	okay , ladies and gentlemen , welcome . i know you're all very excited , but no matter who gets this , i just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes . and the winner is , employee number nine . and that is ? 
20841	0	a	number nine , number nine . jim halpert . 
20842	1	a	oh , no ! 
20843	2	a	okay , wait , i was not . . . i did not-
20844	2	a	guys , listen . this was anonymous , all right ? there is no way i could've given it to myself because i didn't even know who was on here . i just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score . 
20845	2	a	will everybody stop for a second , because obviously i'm not taking any of it . a mistake has been made and we'll figure it out . second of all , there was no cash prize . 
20846	2	a	dwight ? 
20847	1	a	yeah , you said 'in an ideal world , there would be a cash prize . ' isn't that what you said ? 
20848	2	a	no , dwight , i meant . . . yes , in a perfect world , someone would get money . but-
20849	3	a	well zion , i am not going to be paying for your college tuition . which brings me to my main point and that is that i will not be able to pay for anybody's tuition . i'm so , so sorry . 
20850	3	a	i'm sorry . i'm sorry . i'm so sorry . 
20851	3	a	hey , hold-hold on , hold on , hold on , hold on . they're lithium . 
20852	2	a	look , there was a big mistake obviously , so i will fix it . okay ? this was your idea anyway . 
20853	0	a	correction . it was my idea . 
20854	2	a	okay . 
20855	1	a	my idea ! 
20856	4	a	ok , for the record , i am pregnant and , obviously there has been some kind of a mistake , so why doesn't jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we'll move on . 
20857	1	a	excellent idea , pam .

20914	1	a	my diabolical plot is on hold for christmas . my heart just melts with the sound of children singing . hmmph ! not really ! i'm just tired . the days are short . i don't know . maybe i'm depressed . 
20915	1	a	it is time to unveil the tree . 
20916	2	a	yeah . 
20917	2	a	this is all we have . 
20918	2	a	no , it's not 'ugh . ' it is . . . office camaraderie . 
20919	1	a	it is warm feelings . 
20920	1	a	thirty ! twenty-nine ! twenty-eight ! 
20921	2	a	why would you start so high ? 
20922	1	a	twenty- seven ! twenty-six ! . . . 
20923	2	a	three , two , one ! 
20924	4	a	ah ! 
20925	2	a	no . 
20926	1	a	exactly . 
20927	2	a	we didn't , because we think it'd be better to do it together . 
20928	1	a	everyone . 
20929	0	a	why would you wrap it in a sheet , if you're not covering anything up ? 
20930	4	a	is it , is it fake ?

20935	1	a	this was a successful unveiling ! go back to work ! merry christmas ! 
20936	0	a	i begged dwight and jim to give me erin for secret santa . and i decided to give erin the twelve days of christmas . is it my fault that the first eight days is basically thirty birds ? 
20937	1	a	hey santa ! 
20938	4	a	so santa , what can we expect from this party ? 
20939	2	a	hey , creed , we covered it . lump of coal ! 
20940	1	a	for several weeks , my secret santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that i've been attempting to assemble . i'm suspicious of this because i had the exact same idea , for catching osama bin laden . i would simply send him a different piece each day . he would assemble it , to find himself . . . in jail ! 
20941	4	a	you know oscar every time i make this lasagna people ask me if it's a family recipe , but really , i just get the recipe from the box ! 
20942	4	a	is it funny ? i thought it was more . . . interesting , than funny . i think my water just broke ! 
20943	4	a	oscar and the warehouse guy ! go oscar ! go gay warehouse guy ! 
20944	3	a	heeeeeere's santa ! hey little girl , what would you like for christmas ? ooh , you have been a very naughty girl , i see .

20951	3	a	take it back . that is absurd . 
20952	2	a	no , i'm not gonna do that . 
20953	3	a	no ? no ! jim ! come on ! 
20954	2	a	i think she's doing a good job . 
20955	3	a	it's insane ! a woman santa , where does it stop ? no ! jim , this may be the last christmas that we have here , doesn't it make you a tiny bit anxious , me not playing santa ? come on ! 
20956	2	a	i'm not gonna go tell phyllis that she can't be santa . 
20957	3	a	fine ! then do it anonymously . ransom note style . you can- i -you know what , i have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk . you can use those . 
20958	3	a	 ho ho ho ! why pay more to sit next to old tranny claus over there , when you can sit on my lap . phyllis is only . . . pretending to be a man , i'm the real thing . sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt ! 
20959	3	a	no it's not , not like penis-wise . hello little boy , what's your name ? 
20960	3	a	oh ! i am so sorry that phyllis hates you . and hates your body . but , santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well .

20966	3	a	okay get off , get off ! oh ! oh , god ! 
20967	3	a	okay you know what you get ? you get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so santa doesn't have to go through this again . 
20968	2	a	i'm trying phyllis . you're santa . 
20969	2	a	that's what i want . 
20970	2	a	what would bob do ?

21154	3	a	the electric city . scranton ! 
21155	1	a	what ? 
21156	3	a	the electric city . lazy scranton , the electric city . they call it that 'cause of the electricity . the city's laid out from east to west and our public parks are libraries are truly the best . call poison control if you're bitten by a spider . 
21157	1	a	but check that it's covered by your
21158	3	a	plenty of space in the parking lot . 
21159	1	a	but the little cars go in the compact spot ! 
21160	3	a	snack attack time . 
21161	1	a	don't lose your head . 
21162	3	a	we like cugino's
21163	3	a	they call it scranton ! 
21164	1	a	what ? 
21165	3	a	the electric city . scranton ! 
21166	1	a	what ? 
21167	3	a	the electric city . scranton !

21171	3	a	the electric city . scranton ! 
21172	1	a	 what ? 
21173	3	a	ugh . 
21174	3	a	oh , yeah . i got a big box , yes i do . i got a big box how 'bout you ? 
21175	3	a	it's from 'sob-ray' , our new owner , and it is to sabre , us . i wonder what's inside . scissor me . 
21176	3	a	dunder mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named sabre . they stepped in at the 11th hour , and they saved our asses . although david wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right , so we probably could have saved our own asses . we didn't need them touching our asses . 
21177	3	a	oh ! wow . awesome . for accounting , a brand new printer . and for the sales staff , a new fax machine . this cord has creed written all over it . and whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office . thank you . 
21178	1	a	here we go . oh ! wow . 
21179	3	a	cool . what next ? 
21180	3	a	okay , everybody , listen up . i have some bad news . due to circumstances beyond my control -
21181	1	a	impulsivity and inattention to detail . 
21182	3	a	hey , hey . i have opened a box , which should not have been opened . . . 
21183	1	a	terrible mistake . 
21184	3	a	and distributed things which should not have been distributed . 
21185	1	a	undistributable . 
21186	4	a	well , maybe we can put the box back together . 
21187	1	a	impossible . he opened it like an ape . 
21188	4	a	 yep , yep . 
21189	4	a	yep . 
21190	4	a	yes . 
21191	3	a	and - wow . really nice job . this group of people , when they put their minds together , they can do something great . and i think that you should all be proud of yourselves . 
21192	4	a	oh , michael . 
21193	3	a	alright , relax . we can do it . we just did it . so we can do this again . erin , scissor me please . 
21194	4	a	no , don't ! 
21195	3	a	 thank you . oh ! got it . ok . 
21196	3	a	alright , he's on his way up . okay . are we ready ? 
21197	4	a	what do you want us to do ? 
21198	3	a	why do i have to explain everything ? 
21199	4	a	because we're usually not on the same page . 
21200	3	a	okay . 
21201	3	a	gabe seems tall . hope we get along . had a very good thing going with david wallace . he was a good guy . he was somebody i could trust . here he is . you can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me . even though i was there for disciplinary reasons . 
21202	1	a	welcome . scranton hot dog from scranton ? 
21203	3	a	you know what , dwight ? let's give him a minute to settle in , shall we ? ok ? 
21204	3	a	hello , gabe . i am michael scott , co-manager . this is my protege , jim halpert . 
21205	2	a	co-manager , actually . 
21206	3	a	in training . 
21207	2	a	trained . loving it . good at it . so . . . 
21208	3	a	we're very excited too , aren't we guys ? right ? 
21209	1	a	so excited . 
21210	3	a	we have a little song prepared for you . 
21211	3	a	sabre . say-ber . sabre . 
21212	1	a	oh . of course . 
21213	3	a	yes , say-ber . good . take it away guys . 
21214	0	a	ok . 
21215	3	a	saber . 
21216	0	a	saber . dunder mifflin and saber . so yeah , yeah , yay , yay . 
21217	0	a	you sure it's saber ? 
21218	4	a	hey . 
21219	2	a	thank you . hey , we should be fine if we leave around 11:20 . 
21220	4	a	oh , you mapquested it . it's four blocks away . 
21221	2	a	well , now we won't get lost . or we could drive . and that takes one minute . 
21222	4	a	we found a great local daycare . it's rated really high by all the local parenting websites . but that means it's also really hard to get into . 
21223	2	a	turns out , a lot of parents want the very best for their children . that's weird . 
21224	4	a	we're hoping our interview seals the deal . 
21225	2	a	but if not , there's always the army . the infantry . 
21226	4	a	okay . okay . yeah . 
21227	2	a	 so you've been shown a nonsensical video . you're probably wondering , 'what's going on ? ' well , you're not alone . 
21228	3	a	wow . really terrific . 
21229	3	a	perfect . 
21230	3	a	no . don't like that . 
21231	3	a	mm , nope . don't like that . 
21232	3	a	we'll still get to use the little cups , though , right ? 
21233	3	a	i don't know what they're made of . 
21234	1	a	they're 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic . he goes through 20 a day . 
21235	3	a	you know what can't fit in a bottle , are the 20 little trips i take to the cooler , and the 20 little scans i do of everybody to make sure everything's running smoothly . and the 20 little conversations that i have with stanley . 
21236	3	a	 really ? you don't have enough water in there ? your stomach ? 
21237	3	a	what ? 
21238	3	a	i miss the old dunder mifflin . too much change is not a good thing . ask the climate . 
21239	3	a	i don't want to appear ungrateful for everything sabre's doing for us . 
21240	3	a	well , you should have a little . but it's great that you don't , because i am trying to embrace all of these changes , but i'm - i'll be honest , i'm having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of 'em . 
21241	3	a	all of them . 
21242	3	a	so maybe we should call . we should call someone . i could help . i'm good with bosses . call one of the higher-ups ? 
21243	2	a	 ok , this is officially the cutest thing i've ever seen . cubbies . i totally forgot about cubbies . 
21244	4	a	there's a finger-painting station and a curly slide . am i too old to go here ? 
21245	2	a	oh . adorable , right ? i walked in on someone in the bathroom . 
21246	4	a	what ? 
21247	2	a	i just walked in on someone in the bathroom . 
21248	4	a	who ? the -
21249	2	a	i don't know . i don't know . 
21250	4	a	the guy we're meeting with ? 
21251	2	a	i don't know , i don't know . 
21252	0	a	i am telling you , there are no strawberries in here . 
21253	0	a	well maybe they ran away , because the pizza was like , 'hey , get out of here , you stupid strawberries . '
21254	0	a	the ball's totally in erin's court . after the whole drum line thing . 
21255	3	a	hello . no . my name's michael scott . hello . 
21256	3	a	nice to meet you . we are very excited about the merger with sabre . i think you have a great accent . 
21257	3	a	well , i am little concerned with all of these changes , to be quite frank . i think we have done things a certain way here at dunder mifflin for quite some time , and -
21258	3	a	ok . i feel very strongly that you can't just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever . is christian slater back there ? because . . . he knows . he'd know what to do . 
21259	3	a	i have already told him , but i will tell him again if you think that will help . 
21260	4	a	hi jerry . 
21261	2	a	jerry . 
21262	2	a	this is great . got to confess , we came a little early , so we got a quick look around , but , uh -
21263	2	a	no , no , no , no . yes . we saw this , yes . no , it wasn't like a look around . we really just had a peek . quick peek . didn't focus on anything in particular . 
21264	4	a	it's lovely . 
21265	2	a	do it . 
21266	4	a	ok , you've got to pull it together . 
21267	2	a	we should just go . he's really uncomfortable . 
21268	4	a	he's uncomfortable because you're acting weird . so you have to stop acting weird . 
21269	2	a	what if we just bring it up ? we just put it out in the open ? 
21270	4	a	that's the weirdest possible solution to the problem . 
21271	2	a	all right . 
21272	3	a	i have come here today to talk to mr . david wallace about this whole thing going on with sabre . he will know exactly what to do . he is not a big fan of me dropping by announced . but then again , who is ? hey . hi , sorry . 
21273	3	a	i hope you're not busy doing something . 
21274	3	a	you sure ? 
21275	3	a	you look great too . 
21276	3	a	oh , yeah , that sounds good . 
21277	3	a	hey . wow . 
21278	3	a	really loud . 
21279	3	a	wow . oh , yummy . you have got the life , my friend . 
21280	3	a	can i just stay here and never go back ? 
21281	3	a	oh , man . how much time do you have ? 
21282	3	a	yeah . 
21283	3	a	hi . sorry , i was just in the neighborhood , thought i'd come by , see . . . 
21284	3	a	i don't know . 
21285	2	a	there was one thing we were curious about , uh , your flexibility on things like easter or memorial day , because we might want to change our days around a little bit . 
21286	2	a	oh , no , sorry . just , um , we're kind of planners . but we're also flexible too , so you know what ? maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes . 
21287	4	a	is this because jim walked in on you going to the bathroom ? 
21288	2	a	what ? 
21289	2	a	did it ? it might have come up while we were waiting for you . 
21290	2	a	no . 
21291	4	a	maybe , because it doesn't seem to be going super well . 
21292	4	a	nope . 'cause we're really nice people but you don't seem to like us . 
21293	2	a	oh , this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet ? why didn't you just lock the door , man ? 
21294	2	a	anybody could have walked in . 
21295	3	a	sabre is changing everything . site blockers . they don't let us use cups . so i started thinking , who could handle this ? who would know what to do ? david wallace would know what to do . what should i do , david wallace ? 
21296	3	a	exactly . what are you thinking ? 
21297	3	a	it is a tough one . 
21298	3	a	yeah . but one would be good . 
21299	3	a	okay . 
21300	3	a	okay . 
21301	3	a	so the kid's making the noise to pick it up . 
21302	3	a	oh , okay . 
21303	3	a	no , i think it is-
21304	3	a	yep . 
21305	0	a	hey , any fun weekend plans ? 
21306	0	a	uh , no , actually . so nothing ? no movies , or parties , or anything you might want to invite someone to ? 
21307	0	a	okay . 
21308	0	a	that's as hard as i can hint . 
21309	3	a	the what ? 
21310	3	a	oh , okay . 
21311	3	a	like it . 
21312	3	a	there are very few things that would make me not want to team up with david wallace . and suck it is one of 'em . 
21313	3	a	see you later . 
21314	3	a	bye now . 
21315	3	a	thanks for having me . 
21316	3	a	well , that's not the david wallace that i remember . that is some sort of weird creature that lives in david wallace's house . oh , my god . alright . just get me out of here . 
21317	3	a	hello . is anybody home ? oh , thank you , erin . now if everyone would please ready their canteens , so i can fill them with the sweet , sweet nectar of gabe's homeland , and then propose a toast . here we go . 
21318	3	a	you know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them ? i feel sorry for those people . that's the best thing ? really ? ugh . 
21319	3	a	well , i'm not really one for making speeches . 
21320	3	a	but i feel pretty good right now . i really do . a lot better than i did earlier . let me tell you . 
21321	3	a	no . this is my toast . i think this whole thing with sabre is going to work out . i have a very good feeling about it . 
21322	3	a	here's my toast . orange juice is in here . and , like saber , it is from florida , and it is good . 
21323	3	a	here's the toast . i'm gonna do it now . raise your container to us and to sabre . 
21324	3	a	mm . wow . that is metallicy . ugh . that's like drinking a battery . ah , really gets you in the fillings , doesn't it ? okay , anyway , welcome . 
21325	3	a	hello vancouver , this is michael scott calling from the united states of america ! i have a reservation in your fair city from february 12th to the 19th , first week of the olympics . 
21326	3	a	okey doke . 
21327	3	a	what ? 
21328	1	a	 i'm not seeing anything under 'confirmation . '
21329	3	a	no . 
21330	1	a	could it be under 'affirmation ? ' cause you have thousands of those . 
21331	3	a	no . we're trying to look it up right now . 
21332	1	a	you did get the e-vite to my barbeque ! 
21333	3	a	um , come on . 
21334	1	a	michael . . . 
21335	3	a	well , i have been booked for three years , so you should have that . i've always heard that british columbia is a very nice place , but i am not getting that from this conversation . 
21336	1	a	wait , i got it ! confirmation code: xv2rdm ! 
21337	3	a	oh . 
21338	1	a	thank you . 
21339	3	a	that's it ! 
21340	3	a	alright , i would like to cancel my reservation , please . 
21341	3	a	okay , put it on my card . 
21342	3	a	today , jo bennett , the ceo from sabre , is coming to see us here for the first time . she bought us sight unseen , like a mail-order bride , so she's gotta be kinda nervous . i mean , are we ugly ? are we smart ? are we cool ? are we too cool ? do we speak english ? 
21343	3	a	 why hello ! 
21344	3	a	pleasure to meet you , miss bennett . 
21345	0	a	 these sure are pretty dogs . . . 
21346	0	a	they sure do . 
21347	0	a	oh , i do ! 
21348	1	a	hello . 
21349	1	a	i am treating you the same as a man , for whom i would also not stand . unless it was the president . or judge judy . 
21350	0	a	got some valentine's cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers . 
21351	0	a	valentine's day , right around the corner . erin and i have been on zero dates . so i got her a valentine's day card , but i didn't wanna seem 'too eager , ' so i got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit . 
21352	0	a	: look alive . 
21353	3	a	jo , i don't know how things work in florida , which from your description sounds like a colorful , lawless swamp , but here it takes two men to do one job , where in florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job . 
21354	2	a	whoa , whoa . 
21355	3	a	whoa , whoa ! 
21356	2	a	i'll take over . um , what we're doing here: michael handles more of the 'big-picture' stuff , and i handle more of the day-to-day stuff , so together . . . 
21357	2	a	alright . 
21358	2	a	no . 
21359	3	a	and sometimes i can hardly handle that ! 
21360	2	a	i don't think so . 
21361	3	a	forget the question . . . 
21362	3	a	i humbly accept the management position . 
21363	2	a	i . . . why would you just say something like that ? 
21364	3	a	because , well , jim . where i'm from , two types of folk: those who ain't , and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper . which type ain't you ain't ? ya'll come back now . 
21365	2	a	do you even know what that means ? 
21366	3	a	yes . 
21367	2	a	um . . . 
21368	0	a	 whoa-oh , traffic jam ! 
21369	0	a	 beep-beep ! beeooop-beep ! 
21370	0	a	there's blood everywhere ! um , i got you a valentine's card . 
21371	0	a	yeah , well it's snoopy and woodstock . 
21372	0	a	uh , charles schultz did . i thought it was relevant cause i got you all those birds for christmas , remember ? 
21373	0	a	oh , look at that . they sure do . i hadn't noticed . 
21374	0	a	yeah ! it's roger federer for men , i sprayed some in there . 
21375	0	a	it's got pheromones in it . 
21376	3	a	no , we know . texas ! 
21377	3	a	i could manage my way around that . 
21378	3	a	i will try to manage my excitement ! 
21379	3	a	i have been saying the word 'manager' a lot , so whenever jo thinks 'manager' she thinks of me . camel cigarettes did the same thing with joe camel by making him look like a penis . i can't even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a penis . and vise-versa . 
21380	1	a	 i , uh . . . 
21381	4	a	so , check this out . according to the handbook , you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager . they have all these incentive programs . i ran your numbers from last year . 
21382	2	a	this is way more than i make now . 
21383	2	a	i don't think i'm gonna miss being manager . you know how some people say they're not in it for the money ? well , with all due respect to this job , i think i'm definitely in it for the money . and quite honestly , the women . 
21384	2	a	hey , you got a second ? 
21385	3	a	sure . you here to tell me that you think i would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk ? 
21386	2	a	actually , yeah . 
21387	3	a	what ? 
21388	2	a	exactly that . i think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than i do . 
21389	3	a	what ? really ? 
21390	2	a	yeah ! 
21391	3	a	wow ! 
21392	3	a	la la la , hello oscar ! 
21393	3	a	what are you reading ? 
21394	3	a	oh , that is my favorite ocean ! i love it ! i am so happy right now . no ! i can't keep it a secret any longer . jim is stepping down to salesman , i am going to be the sole manager once again . 
21395	3	a	why , is there an untapped gay market ? 
21396	3	a	 . . . where did you get that information . 
21397	3	a	manuel who ? 
21398	3	a	well , according to the manual , there is no cap on commissions . i have been hustled . 
21399	3	a	son of a bitch . pardon me . 
21400	3	a	okay . 
21401	3	a	really ? aw , that is so sweet of you ! but , i cannot accept , because i have been thinking about it , and i think i wanna go back to sales . 
21402	2	a	really . 
21403	3	a	yeah . you can take the man out of the salesman , but you can't take the sales out of salesman . 
21404	2	a	no , i really , really think michael is better at being manager for so many reasons . 
21405	3	a	no , i think i would be bad . i would sleep in my office , and i would sexually harass people . 
21406	2	a	why would you do that ? 
21407	3	a	i'm turning myself in right now ! 
21408	3	a	thank you . 
21409	3	a	great ! that's great . congratulations . have fun signing my commission checks , boss . 
21410	4	a	 oh , michael marked his heights . he's grown ! 
21411	2	a	mm ! 
21412	1	a	 bobcat , this is dragon . listen . he's been promoted to sole manager . we've got to step this up . meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds . 89 . . . 88 . . . 
21413	1	a	you're twenty minutes late ! 
21414	1	a	just admit you lost track of time . 
21415	1	a	ryan and i have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against jim . ryan is always late for our meetings . i wish i had a lair . 
21416	1	a	of course i seesaw . mose and i seesaw all the time . 
21417	1	a	oh , yeah . great film . almost as fun as going on a seesaw . 
21418	1	a	i like where you're going with this . continue . 
21419	1	a	i have an old barn ! 
21420	1	a	it's kinda smelly , but that might be a plus ! and then what ? 
21421	1	a	okay , that's your idea ? exactly like in the movie ! ? that is the most idiotic thing i have ever heard in my life ! 
21422	1	a	he's supposed to cut his leg off ? think ! 
21423	1	a	think ! 
21424	3	a	how is that possible ? 
21425	3	a	no excuses erin , come on ! make it happen . 
21426	3	a	oh , yeah . fine , fine . leave it here . i have to make some sales anyway . who should i call with my magic sales fingers ? michael scott , head of sales . 
21427	2	a	 you gotta do something , man . you can't just sit there . 
21428	1	a	the new it guy . nick . 
21429	1	a	i think he is the key . he's very trusting , he's looking for friends , he has been given an awesome amount of power , and does not know how to wield it . 
21430	1	a	why don't you just let me handle the tolkien references , okay dumb jock ? 
21431	1	a	smeagol was corrupted and became gollum . 
21432	1	a	i might start a diabolical plot against him after this one . 
21433	2	a	what is that ? 
21434	2	a	oh . i'm fine . thank you , though .

21440	1	a	it's not really 1992 anymore . 
21441	3	a	well , okay . . . 
21442	1	a	ho-ho . there he is , the it guy . so you discovered the break room . 
21443	1	a	i imagine one of the best things about being an it guy is , you get to know everyone's computer passwords . 
21444	1	a	listen , i know you have to say that , but we got a little problem here . there is an employee named jim halpert , and he is doing some terrible things , okay ? he is molesting people via the internet . and we need to stop him . 
21445	1	a	no , the cops called us . so i'm gonna need you to give me the password to jim halpert's computer . 
21446	3	a	what is that smell ? do you smell that ? what is that ? like a sulfur deposit under here ? 
21447	4	a	michael , stop . 
21448	3	a	no , i'm serious , we don't have to put up . . . is it the dogs ? 
21449	4	a	michael . . . 
21450	3	a	you know what , we don't have to deal with this . i am going to google sulfur maps . 
21451	1	a	michael , it's phyllis . 
21452	3	a	no , this is geological . 
21453	3	a	are you kidding me ? 
21454	3	a	and you guys are okay with this ? 
21455	1	a	she sent an email , so . 
21456	0	a	 it's not cause of the smell . i'm just expecting a nosebleed . 
21457	3	a	oh my god . 
21458	0	a	i'm sorry , i thought you saw me . 
21459	0	a	cool , thanks .

21462	3	a	hey . 
21463	2	a	hey . 
21464	3	a	you know , it's funny . i used to stand in here and wish i was out there . now i'm out there , and i wish i was in here . 
21465	2	a	well , the grass is always greener . 
21466	3	a	yeah . except there's no grass out there . it's just a farty dirt patch . 
21467	2	a	well , it's what you wanted . 
21468	3	a	i really need my job back . we made a terrible mistake here . 
21469	2	a	for the record , i fought this . alright ? and now , i'm not really sure what we do . 
21470	3	a	we make a poster that says 'happy opposite day ! ' and she sees it on the way out . . . nah , that's stupid . ugh ! i wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from men in black . 
21471	2	a	hey , what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her . 
21472	3	a	lethal weapon ? 
21473	2	a	that's it . i think we should do it the lethal weapon way . 
21474	3	a	what ? what i'm saying . . . 
21475	2	a	michael's saying he's better at being manager , and i agree , cause he's a better people person , weirdly . 
21476	3	a	and weirdly i'm a good dog person , right guys ? see ? they love me . 
21477	2	a	alright . 
21478	3	a	alright ! 
21479	0	a	 excuse me ? everyone ? please check your emails , i just sent you the following message: 'coworkers , you may have received a valentine from me . please understand this does not mean that i like you in any way . '
21480	0	a	phyllis , you guys are like my closest friends . i just mean i don't like-like you . 
21481	0	a	please don't read into this card . yours in professionalism , nard dog . '
21482	0	a	it's n-- that wasn't . . . i like someone else . 
21483	0	a	it's not . . . whether or not , you . . . 
21484	3	a	oh , it smells good in here . 
21485	3	a	erin , what about my keyboard ? aw , so good to be home . how about a little bosa nova ? 
21486	4	a	 he looks happy . 
21487	2	a	yep . 
21488	1	a	well , well , well . hm . boss for , what was it ? oh , four and a half hours ? new record . low . previous record ? henry rosston . boss for nine years , four months . and he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he what ? michael ! 
21489	1	a	 i can't help but think that something we did made this possible . 
21490	1	a	oh temp , i like that . i'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood . care to celebrate with a drink ? 
21491	1	a	because ! martini bars are pretentious . no thank you . 
21492	1	a	it is not 'farm boy swill , ' i will show you . it is beet vodka and it is delicious . 
21493	4	a	 i just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before i went on my maternity leave . . . yeah , i'm pregnant . . . great , well , i'll write up the order . okay , thanks . 
21494	1	a	wait a minute ! you can't do that . you cannot exploit your baby for sales . 
21495	2	a	 hey , did i tell you we were going to have a baby ? oh , thank you very much . i'm excited . oh , definitely . 
21496	1	a	no , no ! you need to come by your sales honorably ! 
21497	4	a	there is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life . people like it . 
21498	1	a	i need a baby . i'll never outsell jim and pam without one . also , i've been noticing a gaping hole in my life . sometimes i wake up cradling a gourd . 
21499	4	a	kevin , you're such a gourmand . 
21500	4	a	hmm . 
21501	4	a	mmmm , that sounds great . what are you thinking ? 
21502	4	a	no , no . i still have time . 
21503	4	a	i'm having contractions , but they're irregular and far apart . so i'm not really in labor , i'm near labor . 
21504	2	a	yeah , we're slow-playing it because of our stupid hmo . 
21505	4	a	if we check in after midnight , i get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors . 
21506	2	a	not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home , if it's crying all night , one of us is going to have to take care of it . and i do not plan on helping unless it's a boy . 
21507	4	a	i cannot wait for that joke to be over . 
21508	4	a	ooh . 
21509	3	a	oh , oh , oh ! contraption ! she's contrapting ! okay , you know what ? i think i should drive you guys to the hospital , and here is why . i am a licensed , classy driver in the state of pennsylvania . i gassed up the car . . . 
21510	2	a	michael . 
21511	3	a	actually , i put diesel in this time , trying to save some money . 
21512	2	a	michael , you shouldn't have done that . 
21513	3	a	happy to do it . also , i did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office . 
21514	4	a	you know the baby's not going to live here , right ? 
21515	3	a	well , the baby was conceived here , so might as well live here a little bit , too . 
21516	2	a	hmm , that logic's air-tight , but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here . burning man , port-o-potty . 
21517	3	a	oh , yuck ! tmi ! how was it ? i don't want to know . tell me later . let's go ! let's go ! hospital ! 
21518	4	a	okay , okay , we're not going to the hospital . we are waiting until midnight . 
21519	2	a	because the insurance company only covers two nights . 
21520	4	a	everything's fine . we have plenty of time . 
21521	3	a	shut up , nick . what a weird thing to say . weird i . t . nerd . don't get revenge on me , nerd . 
21522	1	a	ha , nerd . 
21523	1	a	 bare my child . 
21524	1	a	i want to have a child for business reasons and i want you to be the mother . if you agree , say nothing . if you disagree , say anything . . . very well . let's meet at 4:00 pm at our old meeting spot and bang it out . 
21525	2	a	 that's seven minutes . here we go . this is happening . come on . 
21526	4	a	hold on , hold on . it isn't midnight yet . 
21527	2	a	are you serious ? pam . 
21528	4	a	no , the doctor said every five to seven minutes . 
21529	2	a	i . . . pam , please . 
21530	4	a	i'm going to be okay , we should really try to make it until midnight . 
21531	0	a	yeah , no , you really should . because if your baby's born tomorrow , he's going to have the same birthday as butt-mud brooks . my old roommate . 
21532	4	a	did you hear that ? butt-mud brooks . 
21533	2	a	okay , but we are leaving at five minutes apart . 
21534	4	a	five minutes apart . 
21535	2	a	so , the plan was seven minutes . but we're calling an audible , because that's her call . because she's the quarterback . i'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant . 
21536	4	a	okay , stop watching me . 
21537	2	a	okay , crazy . i think i have some better things to do with my day than worry about you , like sell printers . 
21538	4	a	mm-hmm . 
21539	2	a	well not until friday 20% off toner cartridges , that's a big deal . while we're on the subject , why don't i just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check ? 
21540	4	a	not until midnight . 
21541	0	a	guys . word of advice . speaking as a former baby . don't get too hung up on baby names . i was named walter jr . after my father until i was about six or so , when my parents changed their minds . 
21542	0	a	my brother was born , and my parents felt he better exemplified the walter jr . name , so they gave it to him . i was given andrew , which they got out of a baby name book . 
21543	2	a	you know , it's getting real crowded in here . maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet . 
21544	3	a	no , no , no , no , no . you know what ? you can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore . 
21545	2	a	 okay , i feel like this noise is going to prevent pam from being able to listen to her body's signals . 
21546	4	a	actually , the distractions are good . i mean , i don't think i'm going to make it until midnight if i'm just sitting here thinking about it . 
21547	3	a	distractions are good ! that means conference room , five minutes ! no , no , five seconds ! right now , right now ! conference room ! topic , potpourri ! let's go ! 
21548	3	a	um , i am sort of a master of distraction . when i was a kid , my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how i was always able to distract others in class . try to think , what were the first thirteen colonies ? mm-hmm , mm-hmm . 
21549	3	a	the purpose for this meeting is to take pam's mind off of what's going on inside of her body . 
21550	0	a	can we do sleight of hand tricks ? 
21551	3	a	i will allow that . 
21552	0	a	yes ! can anyone do those ? 
21553	2	a	 oh ! oh , alright . that's a good one . 
21554	4	a	oh , okay , uh , sorry , guys . just , um , keep talking . 
21555	3	a	okay . 
21556	4	a	oh , thanks , kelly . 
21557	3	a	does anybody have anything ? anything interesting , any hobbies , uh , special skills ? 
21558	4	a	yes , this is the only time i'm ever going to make this request . 
21559	3	a	yes , phyl ? 
21560	3	a	 nope , nope , i don't think anybody wants to see that . 
21561	0	a	i can do the evolution of dance-dance . 
21562	3	a	 that sounds good ! do you need some music , or . . . ? okay . 
21563	0	a	nope , actually music would just throw me off . i need complete silence . okay . . . you're clapping . i need complete silence . totally threw me off , so i'm going to have to start over . evolution of dance-dance . 
21564	1	a	have a seat . 
21565	1	a	before we conceive a child , uh , it is important that we bang out a parenting contract . 
21566	1	a	it's been a long time since we've come down here separately . 
21567	1	a	now , then . let's get to it , shall we ? item one: child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months , then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father , dwight schrute , hereafter referred to as morpheus . agreed ? 
21568	3	a	 where are we ? we have every six minutes , ladies and gentlemen . another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there . 
21569	2	a	okay , you know what ? i'm going to go give , uh , doctor asmani a quick call . he'd probably know . . . 
21570	4	a	jim , please . happy thoughts here . happy times . 
21571	3	a	yeah , happy times . come on . let's have happy times . 
21572	2	a	alright . 
21573	3	a	jim , as a matter of fact , i have printed out ten ways to induce labor . and i'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor . erin , read the first one . 
21574	3	a	okay , nobody touch pam's nipples . think of pam's nipples as toby's grundle . 
21575	3	a	okay , yeah , why don't you go get it ? 
21576	3	a	okay , the opposite of that ? 
21577	2	a	nope , nope , nope , nope . come on , let's go to the hospital . pam , let's go to the hospital right now . 
21578	4	a	jim , jim , honey , i love you , but you're really distracting me from my distractions . 
21579	2	a	mm-hmm . okay , great . well , sorry . 
21580	4	a	why don't you go do some work ? 
21581	2	a	great . i will do that . sorry , pam , i just feel a little bit frazzled . and you know how very rarely i use that word . frazzled . 
21582	4	a	i know , you don't like to be frazzled . 
21583	2	a	no , i don't . 
21584	4	a	okay . 
21585	2	a	oh , and by the way , hate that you're helping her with this right now . totally . 
21586	3	a	ooh , someone's freakin' . 
21587	0	a	a little frazzled . 
21588	3	a	i think he is . 
21589	1	a	acceptable names include and are limited to: ebenezer . 
21590	1	a	jonas . 
21591	1	a	warf . 
21592	1	a	okay . fine . 
21593	1	a	irrelevant question . section 5a , child shall be male . 
21594	1	a	yes you can . 
21595	1	a	it's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex , and then extremely cold for five months . 
21596	2	a	 hey . 
21597	4	a	hey . i'm not going to get in the car , because i know if i do you'll try to drive me to the hospital .

21802	4	a	one , and then wrap around . it's okay . hold that arm down . 
21803	2	a	i can't . she's too strong . she's , careful , though . you don't want to break it . 
21804	4	a	she's not gonna . . . just . . . 
21805	2	a	i got it . alright .

21817	2	a	oh ! really ? must have sat on it , pam . 
21818	4	a	i can't tell if she's getting anything . it just doesn't really feel right . 
21819	4	a	even if she's not getting anything ? 
21820	4	a	no . i read in the book about nipple confusion . 
21821	4	a	she's just , she's really tentative about latching , and i just , i want to keep her self-esteem up . 
21822	2	a	alright . 
21823	2	a	it's going to be alright . 
21824	4	a	maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies . 
21825	2	a	ha ha . no , yeah , that will be good . 
21826	3	a	what would you say , if i told you that i was about to change your life ? 
21827	3	a	i would like you to meet your new boyfriend .

21831	3	a	bye . 
21832	3	a	okay . this is going to kill kevin .

21834	3	a	no , kevin doesn't have an elephant heart . but he is very sensitive . and it won't kill erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like i promised him . . . i bet his heart is enlarged , though . 
21835	3	a	just don't let him sit on you . . . i'm kidding . you'll have fun . it'll be good . it'll be good . there he is . go to him .

21842	2	a	yup . really great . when's she available ? 
21843	4	a	so , uh , biggest thing , besides not being able to get her to latch . . . 
21844	4	a	oh , thank you . is that um , i can't tell if i'm really producing . i don't know if she's getting anything . 
21845	4	a	okay . 
21846	4	a	okay . 
21847	4	a	no , i mean , it feels . . . pressure .

21849	4	a	no . it just feels like pressure . 
21850	2	a	yup . 
21851	2	a	yeah .

21867	2	a	okay , i'll just go get the other guy . 
21868	1	a	 hey , what's up , kid ? 
21869	1	a	nothing left to do except dot the i's , the j's , and the umlauts . why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon ?

21885	3	a	okay , even if someone told you that , you should know that that could never be possible , kevin . and i'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place . 
21886	3	a	no . 
21887	3	a	lynn was as hot as erin . 
21888	3	a	this isn't about me , and that is debatable . and i have a personality , where as you . . . yes , andy ?

21959	0	a	erin go braugh ! 
21960	0	a	thanks . it's actually my sister's old field hockey skirt . 
21961	0	a	erin and i have our first date tonight , and it has to be perfect . why ? because according to 'how i met your mother' that's the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about , and you better have a good story for them .

21963	1	a	great .

21970	2	a	good lord ! i can't believe i'm missing this . 
21971	4	a	it's kind of like that lip thing she did last night , like a half snarl , half smile ? i get the sense that she's very ironic . 
21972	2	a	okay . love you . we'll talk soon . 
21973	1	a	must be amazing being a father right , a miracle of life ? 
21974	2	a	it is . big time . 
21975	1	a	ah , that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now . 
21976	2	a	pretty amazing . 
21977	1	a	what up is , what down is , who mom is , who dad is . must be tough being here with all that going on . 
21978	2	a	oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons . 
21979	1	a	i mean , you're here at work , and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father . 
21980	2	a	is that what happened to you ? 
21981	1	a	i'll tell you what happened to me . i didn't see my father for the first two years of my life . i thought my mother was my father , and my wet-nurse was my mother . 
21982	2	a	that's a common mistake . 
21983	1	a	turned out fine for me . but mose ? oh . same story , different ending . 
21984	3	a	that is a great idea jb . 
21985	3	a	oscar , homosexual accountant . 
21986	3	a	daryl . mellow , soulful , smart for warehouse . . . 
21987	3	a	okay .

21990	3	a	well , i am heading down there . 
21991	3	a	how about july 4th weekend ? 
21992	3	a	i did ! 
21993	3	a	you know what , in the spirit of full disclosure , i have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights , but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left , so i think we should pull the trigger and -
21994	3	a	all right , everybody , just try to put a brave face on . 
21995	3	a	let's follow the chain of events . jo likes michael . jo invites michael to house . jo doesn't like michael anymore . hmmm . 
21996	3	a	hello . i want you to stop what you're doing right now . you are stressed , and i'm taking you to lunch .

22410	1	a	dissolved . don't worry , you're free . okay ? okay . see you later . 
22411	2	a	 wow . maybe we should tell her that he's not normally like this . 
22412	4	a	maybe it should come from a man . 
22413	2	a	maybe it should come from a note . . . with flowers . . . tomorrow . 
22414	3	a	hello . 
22415	3	a	hi .

22429	4	a	do you guys want some food ? the wings are really good here . 
22430	3	a	hey , you embarrassed my friends in front of me and i'm gonna need you to go back over to the table and apologize . 
22431	3	a	i am here with my employees . i am here on a date . hello . 
22432	3	a	well , it just so happens that i am a manager too . and the way i manage people is that i touch their hearts and souls with humor , with love and maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle . and i don't see that from you . 
22433	3	a	yes it is . i am writing a book about it . 
22434	3	a	i've written all of it . . . in my head .

22441	0	a	 hi . 
22442	0	a	i don't normally do this , but . . . 
22443	0	a	just sit down next to a beautiful woman and start talking to myself to confuse other people . 
22444	0	a	 what are you doing ? 
22445	0	a	we didn't say we were gonna , like , start groping strangers ! 
22446	0	a	get in here . where did you learn to talk like that ? 
22447	0	a	well , what movie ? black snake moan ? 
22448	3	a	i manage a paper company-dunder mifflin/sabre .

22461	3	a	hey , julie ! you having fun ? 
22462	0	a	this is not what i want my relationship to look like . 
22463	0	a	 hi , ladies and gentlemen . my name is andrew bernard , and i've been on two dates with erin hannon and they went well , and there will probably be more . thank you . 
22464	0	a	you know , it got to the point where keeping it a secret was just too much drama . and i hate drama , so there you go . 
22465	0	a	i know , i do , right ? i'm a total drama queen . 
22466	1	a	with this move , he can't get you . 
22467	1	a	oh , please . i wish he'd come after me . i would be like-aaah ! 
22468	1	a	sh-what ? 
22469	1	a	no , no , no . blah blah blah blah ! 
22470	1	a	what are you-
22471	1	a	angela . . . 
22472	1	a	you're really putting me in an awkward position here . 
22473	1	a	angela , not here ! 
22474	1	a	you are an impressive specimen . 
22475	4	a	oh-oh , gosh . oh .

22494	4	a	it's nice to see you again , dwight . 
22495	1	a	hello , pam . 
22496	0	a	 i was just wondering what you had planned for secretary's day . 
22497	3	a	i'm going to give erin $15 . 
22498	3	a	a one-on-one lunch with erin ? 
22499	0	a	yeah . she really looks up to you . and there's only so much we can do as her coworkers . secretary's day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing . . 
22500	3	a	she's kind of a rube . 
22501	0	a	 that's my girlfriend you're talking about . 
22502	3	a	okay . all right . all right . okay . i'll take her to lunch . 
22503	0	a	 she's gonna be so psyched . 
22504	3	a	 hi , erin . happy secretary's day . 
22505	3	a	i wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because i was hoping to ask you to . . . lunch . 
22506	3	a	ugh . 
22507	3	a	well , hayworth's is more business casual , and they always screw up your order . so i'm . . . 
22508	3	a	okay , well , we'll figure something . 
22509	3	a	 okay , let's go to hayworth's . 
22510	3	a	all right . 
22511	3	a	 would you mind if i listen to my book on tape ? i'm kind of a bookworm . this is the novelization of the movie precious based on the book push by sapphire . 
22512	3	a	 i don't know . 
22513	3	a	ahhh . 
22514	3	a	right . 
22515	3	a	an age or month ? 
22516	3	a	i've been trying . i've been trying to keep it going . erin is just weird . 
22517	3	a	so how are things going with andy ? 
22518	3	a	well , let's see . um . . . andy . plays the banjo . 
22519	3	a	other than the fact that he dated angela , i don't think he is a snappy dresser . 
22520	3	a	i don't think he is the best dresser . reminds me of easter . 
22521	3	a	mm-hmm . you didn't know that ? oh . 
22522	3	a	okay . 
22523	3	a	i don't know . probably didn't want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else . 
22524	3	a	they were engaged , so . . . okay , you know what , sir ? 
22525	3	a	yeah , i asked for pickles with my burger . and there are only , like five or six . could i get some more pickles ? 
22526	3	a	thank you . 
22527	3	a	mm-hmm . yeah . 
22528	3	a	well . . . 
22529	3	a	what are you doing ? what are you doing ? 
22530	3	a	okay , okay . you know what ? you know what ? you know what ? everybody's looking at you right now . 
22531	3	a	 i'll have what she's having ! 
22532	3	a	 did you have a . . . did you like your lunch ? did you have a good lunch ? did you like that ? did you enjoy your food ? it was good . i liked my lunch . 
22533	4	a	 ooh . ah-ah-ah . ha-ha . 
22534	2	a	what's up ? 
22535	1	a	her milk is coming in . she's getting uncomfortable . 
22536	2	a	dwight , don't be gross . 
22537	4	a	no , no , he's right . 
22538	1	a	same thing happens with my cows if i don't tend them frequently enough . you gotta milk them , or else they'll moo like crazy . 
22539	4	a	that's weird , my breast pump is missing . have you seen my breast pump ? 
22540	1	a	 all right , this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you , believe me . 
22541	4	a	you know what , dwight ? let me just check the bathroom first . okay ? 
22542	1	a	really ? fine . let your breasts explode . three squeezes and i would drain you . 
22543	4	a	mm . meredith ! 
22544	4	a	what are you doing ? ! 
22545	4	a	relax ? ! 
22546	4	a	give it back to me now . 
22547	4	a	it's disgusting ! 
22548	4	a	it's not sterile ! 
22549	0	a	so . . . how was lunch ? 
22550	0	a	was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be ? 
22551	0	a	well , i know . just want . . . i mean . . . 
22552	4	a	jim does a really good one . do yours . 
22553	2	a	oh , guys . i really refuse to participate . 'michael , can i have an advance on my paycheck because a mrs . fields cookie just opened up at the mall . '
22554	2	a	sorry , gabe , but that show hasn't been on in many cookies . '
22555	0	a	hey . can i have your attention please ? first of all , thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together . and a very special shout-out to the chair of the party planning committee , miss angela martin . you have outdone yourself . 
22556	3	a	you know what , i think we can all agree that angela's not so great , so . . 
22557	0	a	i am saying the exact opposite . angela is fantastic . 
22558	3	a	no . no . no . 
22559	0	a	specific shout-out . . 
22560	3	a	stop talking . 
22561	3	a	oh god . 
22562	0	a	can we talk about this in private ? 
22563	0	a	yes . 
22564	4	a	no , no never . 
22565	1	a	yeah pretty much . 
22566	4	a	 'hey , erin , you look delicious . i mean , beautiful . '
22567	4	a	what ? what do you mean , suspend me ? 
22568	2	a	i think you need to go a little easy . you can't just suspend someone form work . 
22569	1	a	wait , what ? i was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making . 
22570	0	a	why would that be something to talk about on secretary's day ? 
22571	3	a	andy , she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with . all right ? and besides , who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them ? that's like . . that's like mr . and mrs . smith crap . 
22572	0	a	i was going to tell her , just on my own time . 
22573	3	a	you know what , i resent the implication that i would keep that secret . everyone here knows that i can't and won't keep a secret . 
22574	0	a	who cares ? i mean it's not like i killed someone . big deal right ? this can blow over in two seconds . she never asked me . so , if you think about it . . . i probably should have told her i guess . everybody does stupid things . 
22575	4	a	hey . you know i was engaged before jim . 
22576	4	a	yeah . and he worked here too . 
22577	4	a	no , no it wasn't andy . it wasn't . it doesn't matter . it's not about who you've been with . it's about who you end up with . sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants . 
22578	4	a	thank you . 
22579	4	a	 hey toby . 
22580	4	a	very interesting . 
22581	4	a	 thanks toby . 
22582	4	a	i don't think an apology is enough . i really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension . 
22583	2	a	and i got to take this bad attitude , and i got to go home , and i got to adjust it . and i hope the suspension does that . 
22584	1	a	 prideful idiots . watch how it's done . gabriel , i apologize . 
22585	1	a	 i kneel before you . 
22586	1	a	humbly taking your hand upon which i kiss to show my contrition . 
22587	0	a	will you stop walking for one second ? that's it . there's no other secrets . ok ? i mean yeah , my chest is not naturally hairless , and my parents pay my credit card bill . 
22588	0	a	a year . 
22589	0	a	yeah but that's it . now you know everything about me . i promise . and if i think of anything else . . . 
22590	0	a	i didn't see that movie . 
22591	1	a	what was that ? are you kidding me ? was that an impression ? 
22592	1	a	i have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit . '
22593	3	a	erin ? 
22594	3	a	no , no , i was just watching cookie monster . it finally downloaded . mind if i sit down ? 
22595	3	a	oh . yep . i'm sorry about that . i feel . . . i'm sorry i caused that thing . 
22596	3	a	you said butt . 
22597	3	a	ahh ! you said it ! you know who you would love ? oh , this guy in my neighborhood , tom dizemore . this is him: 'hey ! hey scott ! '
22598	0	a	sometimes telling someone something is hard . well , at least someone made her happy on secretary's day . 
22599	2	a	yeah , i mean , the count has a very distinct voice . 
22600	4	a	yeah . 'i vant to count to ten' . 
22601	4	a	that would have been funny . 
22602	3	a	 oh , oh , i was just watching that . did you do that , man ? 'oscar . i am the count . ' nailed him . nailed him . good work cookie monster . 
22603	3	a	buenos dias , erin . 
22604	3	a	no , no , no , no . solamente en espanol , por favor . 
22605	3	a	i believe that every man , woman , and child in this country should learn how to speak spanish . they are our neighbors to the south , and this would be a healing thing for . . . for all of north america . and . . . i am going on vacation next week to cancun . 
22606	3	a	buenos dias , jaime . 
22607	2	a	buenos dias , miguel . como estas ? bien ? claro que si ! yo estoy fantastico . que pasa ? 
22608	3	a	ha ha ! buenos dias , dwight ! 
22609	1	a	guten tag , herr michael . 
22610	1	a	i don't understand why michael is wasting his time with spanish . i have it on very good authority that within 20 years , everyone will be speaking german . or a chinese-german hybrid . 
22611	3	a	la telefona . 
22612	3	a	 oh . eso es lo que dice , el ! 
22613	3	a	damn it . ah , angelo . 
22614	3	a	yo soy cancun . 
22615	2	a	all right , so i'll finish up on bulk pricing , and then you go into delivery guarantee . 
22616	4	a	you know , maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there , like , um . . . like , 'i just delivered a baby . they didn't offer me a guarantee . '
22617	2	a	yeah , or maybe we don't even need that . 
22618	3	a	can you smell the power of the halperts ? power couple . 
22619	1	a	you know what ? i should be getting this client , michael . my numbers are better than either of theirs . 
22620	3	a	i went with the people i thought would put the best face on the company . 
22621	1	a	if you want people to put the best face on something , why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives ? 
22622	2	a	 that's a good point . 
22623	4	a	this is our first joint sales pitch . i think we're gonna work really well together . 
22624	2	a	yeah i think we have complimentary strengths . we understand each other . 
22625	4	a	we have good give and take . i give , he takes . 
22626	2	a	 i don't even know who you are anymore . 
22627	4	a	 yee . 
22628	2	a	oh , hey , miss newton . hi , i'm jim . 
22629	2	a	how are you ? 
22630	3	a	did somebody order a hooker over here ? 
22631	3	a	hi . how are you ? 
22632	3	a	there's this woman i met a few weeks ago . her name is donna , the manager of sid & dexter's and , right now , we're in the midst of a passionate love affair . um , no . but she is coming by today . maybe to buy some printers , so . . . 
22633	3	a	right here , we have the wonder twins , jim and pam halpert . they will be assisting you today . 
22634	4	a	oh , no we're actually married . we're not brother and sister . 
22635	2	a	all right . 
22636	2	a	 so , yes , laser printers are more expensive . but they cost less to operate so it's a tradeoff . 
22637	3	a	 hi . 
22638	2	a	hold on one second . 
22639	3	a	sorry to interrupt . sorry to interrupt . do you , donna , by any chance shop at victoria's secret ? 
22640	2	a	what ? 
22641	3	a	because i keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me . 
22642	2	a	none of this is time sensitive . 
22643	3	a	uh , yes , uh , the sale is on now through may . 
22644	3	a	okay , i have more of them . 
22645	1	a	what is this ? 
22646	1	a	it doesn't just sound a'ight , it sounds amazing . 
22647	1	a	how do i apply ? 
22648	1	a	uh , glasses wearers . cholera survivors . geniuses . non-organic family farmers . the list goes on and on . you want me to keep going ? 
22649	1	a	come here . come here . 
22650	1	a	ten seconds ago , this guy was driving a forklift . okay ? now all off a sudden he's cinderella of the office . what are you guys thinking ? 
22651	1	a	one minority from this branch is going to get into this program . who would i refer ? hmm . . . the competent , hardworking one who does things his own way , or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines ? 
22652	1	a	oh , man . white people , right ? 
22653	1	a	well , you can kinda tell from the voice . 
22654	1	a	i bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot , just because of your race . 
22655	1	a	i think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program . 
22656	1	a	i know , 'cause you have no role models . how many indian ceo's can you think of ? 
22657	1	a	you could be the indian bill gates . you could be the indian ted turner . 
22658	1	a	that's not . . . she's . . . okay . yes . 
22659	3	a	i took the liberty to scan a few things earlier , and i want to show you . . . there we go ! whoa , look at those vivid colors . look at my eyes . those are shrek-green eyes . that is me again . i think this displays the crisp , dazzling white . 
22660	3	a	and that would be a display of the crisp , gorgeous black . 
22661	3	a	it's subtle . that's how it works . i show her an image that turns her on . and then she looks at me , then back at me , then back at the image . soon , she doesn't know what is me , what is the image . she just knows that she's turned on . 
22662	3	a	this is a place that i like to go to be alone with my thoughts . i've never taken anybody there before . 
22663	3	a	ryan . 
22664	3	a	and that's it . that's me . that's who i am . 
22665	3	a	oh , thanks . you're not bad , either . 
22666	3	a	hmm . 
22667	3	a	jim ! could you come in here for a sec ? what was that printer we were looking at ? 
22668	3	a	 you didn't see it , pam . she was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move . shortbread ? 
22669	2	a	no . 
22670	4	a	i'll have one . 
22671	2	a	well , maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work . 
22672	3	a	oh really , jim ? what about pam ? and you did a heck of a lot more than kiss . maybe this could be my pam . 
22673	2	a	okay . well , all that is irrelevant . 
22674	4	a	maybe michael has a point . i mean , if she was really that upset , she wouldn't still be here . 
22675	3	a	look , i know that i screwed up in there . i know that i probably messed up your sale . i just want to go in and fix it . 
22676	4	a	what if i back out and you finish the pitch with jim ? 
22677	2	a	what ? 
22678	2	a	what was that ? 
22679	4	a	just let him flirt with her . people meet each other all sorts of ways . 
22680	2	a	pam , you know he's not gonna get anywhere , and he's gonna blow our sale . 
22681	4	a	who cares ? it's not that huge a sale . 
22682	2	a	hey , the schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale . 
22683	4	a	don't act like you understood anything that guy said . good luck , wingman . 
22684	1	a	how as being a minority affected you ? 
22685	1	a	oh , good , and you resent this because . . . 
22686	1	a	oh , no , no . that's not dorky . look , it's easily accessible . boom , like this . 911 , hello . scranton strangler's in the house . inside the house . 
22687	4	a	maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger . 
22688	2	a	uh , for that printer , yes . unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility . 
22689	2	a	yeah . 
22690	3	a	so maybe we could find a little wiggle room , right ? 
22691	2	a	what's that ? 
22692	3	a	maybe wee find some wiggle room ? 
22693	2	a	i don't . . . i don't think so . 
22694	3	a	i think we could . 
22695	3	a	okay , well sometimes . . . sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money , right ? like for tax purposes . 
22696	3	a	why don't you run them again ? 
22697	2	a	what if she's just flirting with you to get a better price ? 
22698	3	a	if she is , it's working . 
22699	2	a	she does not like him . 
22700	4	a	you can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them . how do you think we got together ? 
22701	2	a	cause i stopped by your desk like 15 times a day . 
22702	4	a	i was after your money . 
22703	2	a	well , the joke was on you . 
22704	4	a	yes , it was . 
22705	1	a	hey . . . what are you guys doing ? 
22706	1	a	you know , we really should keep practicing for this interview . 
22707	1	a	ryan ? what does he know ? 
22708	1	a	we ? '
22709	1	a	kelly will be even worse than darryl . if you'd have told me this morning that today i'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction , i 'd have thought you were referring to the bull mose and i are trying to reanimate . 
22710	3	a	so corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller . . . 
22711	3	a	operating blahdy blahdy blah . boilerplate . pound of fish . just kidding . do you like mints ? 
22712	3	a	i carry mints with me sometimes . you ever tried those ? 
22713	3	a	they're good 
22714	3	a	sure . 
22715	3	a	i can't stop myself from kissing her . 
22716	0	a	well , why don't you just move the m&m's ? 
22717	3	a	okay , guys , guys , guys . just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time . 
22718	2	a	it is totally insane . 
22719	3	a	okay . what do you think ? 
22720	3	a	andy ? 
22721	0	a	ehh . 
22722	3	a	okay , some for , some against . 
22723	2	a	nobody's for . 
22724	3	a	pam ? 
22725	4	a	hmm ? 
22726	4	a	um . . . i think it's really , really unlikely . 
22727	2	a	okay . 
22728	4	a	really unlikely . but i can't say that it's impossible . 
22729	2	a	what ? 
22730	4	a	i'm not saying she's in love with him . but she could have left a while ago . most printer sales are done over the phone , ms . boob shirt . 
22731	3	a	i'm going with pam's group . 
22732	2	a	wait . 
22733	3	a	here we go . 
22734	2	a	michael . michael . 
22735	3	a	okay . 
22736	2	a	michael . 
22737	3	a	no , guys , guys , guys . guys , just . . . thank you for talking . wish me luck . 
22738	2	a	no . 
22739	3	a	what sort of movie would rudy have been if he had just stopped , given up , after two rejections ? would have been a lot shorter . probably been a lot funnier . but it would have ultimately been a disappointment . i still would have seen it , but that's not . . . the point . 
22740	1	a	kelly is disqualified ! 
22741	1	a	you said the program is not open to caucasians . well . . . anthropologically , she is indian . indians migrated from the caucuses region of europe . therefore , technically , she is caucasian . you're welcome , america . 
22742	1	a	well , obviously , she is brownish . but come on , i mean , darryl is far more ethnic . 
22743	1	a	kelly is the only applicant . 
22744	1	a	oh , dear god . okay . don't make any decisions just yet . okay ? i'll be right back . 
22745	3	a	we should have your contract done by thursday . 
22746	3	a	okay . 
22747	3	a	yeah it was nice to do business with you , too . 
22748	3	a	i don't know . i think so . 
22749	3	a	 okay . so . . . oh , donna ? 
22750	3	a	thank you so much . 
22751	3	a	mmm . 
22752	3	a	 ahem . so , um . . . okay , if you have . . . if there's any other questions that you have . . . 
22753	3	a	all right . all right . bye . 
22754	3	a	and have a good elevator ride . 
22755	3	a	oh , what's that out there ? 
22756	1	a	how would one of you feel if i told you i could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company ? 
22757	1	a	i wasn't talking to you , pale-face . 
22758	1	a	what i'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management . 
22759	1	a	yes . 
22760	1	a	speaking of rainbows , oscar . . . you are kind of a double minority . gay . so we at sabre could really benefit from your perspective . 
22761	1	a	i can protect you from kelly . will you get out of here ? seriously . 
22762	1	a	whoa , whoa . whoa , whoa , whoa ! this is hide toshi hasagawa . he would like to apply for the sabre minority executive training program 'print in all colors' initiative . 
22763	1	a	helping heal america in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour . 
22764	1	a	caucasians , am i right ? have a seat . i'll translate . 
22765	1	a	you don't know what you need . just . . . 
22766	4	a	hey , michael . how you doing ? 
22767	3	a	i don't know . i don't know . can't really trust my feelings anymore . 
22768	4	a	you know what , michael ? for what it's worth . . . i was wrong , too . i thought she was interested in you . 
22769	3	a	she suckered you too . 
22770	4	a	mm-hmm . 
22771	3	a	was it the cleavage ? 
22772	4	a	yeah , and the shoulder cutouts . 
22773	3	a	yep . 
22774	0	a	you know , when i tore my scrote , i was , uh . . . i was seeing this really hot urologist about it , and thought she was into me . but now i think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my hmo . you know , she's touching around down there . it's easy to get confused . 
22775	3	a	god . she left this here ? 
22776	3	a	okay . maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work . 
22777	2	a	what ? 
22778	3	a	yeah . this could be a signal . people don't just take barrettes off . 
22779	4	a	michael . . . 
22780	3	a	 well . . . 
22781	4	a	she doesn't want you to return the barrette . she's not interested in you . 
22782	3	a	yeah , i know . i know . 
22783	4	a	i'm sorry . 
22784	3	a	i know . you're right . thank you . thanks everybody . 
22785	4	a	michael ! 
22786	3	a	oh . you're still here . i have your baguette . 
22787	1	a	hey , kiddo . congratulations are in order . you deserve it . 
22788	1	a	oh . 
22789	1	a	gosh . he he . 
22790	1	a	just once , i would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong . is that too much to ask ? 
22791	3	a	you know what ? everybody told me that you weren't interested . everybody . and i didn't believe 'em . and they were right . so . . . there's your barrette . 
22792	3	a	who ? 
22793	3	a	about what ? 
22794	3	a	no , no . no . 
22795	3	a	no . . . 
22796	3	a	 what happened ? 
22797	3	a	really ? ! oh , that's great . that's such good news . i did it ! i kissed . we kissed . 
22798	3	a	no , i'm serious . it . . . this happened . i went down to the parking lot and i was . . . i returned her barrette we ki . . . we did . okay . we did . we did . 
22799	3	a	you know what ? it doesn't matter . because i know it happened . and that is all that counts . i did do it ! 
22800	1	a	stop it ! 
22801	2	a	stop what ? 
22802	1	a	you're talking about me in morse code . well , you know what ? joke's on you 'cause i know morse code . ha ! 
22803	2	a	 yeah . that's what we're doing . in our very limited free time and with our very limited budget , we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you . 
22804	2	a	yup . that's exactly what we did . 
22805	4	a	it all started when dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk . when i asked him to stop , he said , 'i will when you lose the baby weight . '
22806	1	a	very well . i must have imagined it . i apologize . detonator . detonator where ? michael ! 
22807	3	a	jim . are you clicking a detonator ? 
22808	2	a	it's a pen . 
22809	1	a	michael , come on . 
22810	3	a	get back to work , dwight . please . 
22811	1	a	fine . hey . tap away . 
22812	3	a	ooh ! things with donna are so . . . oh-ho-ho ! they're going great . i , uh . . . we're just clicking on every level . emotionally and sexually and . . . orally and i am not used to relationships going this well . i'm actually having trouble focusing on my job . and i like it ! 
22813	3	a	okay . 
22814	3	a	okay , you get out of here , big dog . ah , no , no , no , no . you guys sit down . i need ideas . 
22815	4	a	stanley got to go . 
22816	3	a	yeah , well , stanley doesn't help with anything . come on . shout 'em out , shout 'em out . 
22817	0	a	walk around apple orchards . 
22818	3	a	oh ! 
22819	0	a	super romantic . 
22820	3	a	that's fun . 
22821	1	a	eel fishing . 
22822	3	a	all right . 
22823	3	a	we actually went to the poconos last tuesday . we headed up there , we went to a little chinese bistro , um , p . f . chang's . 
22824	3	a	because when your super-hot girlfriend says , 'i wanna go to mount pocono , ' you go to mount pocono and you do her . and we screwed . whoops . tmi . 
22825	3	a	you know what , kelly ? this is the real world . not the real world: scranton . oh my god , this is super weird . when ryan had two girlfriends , he used to take me to some diner in hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see . 
22826	3	a	you guys think donna's cheating on me ? 
22827	4	a	no , michael , no . 
22828	1	a	are you nuts ? 
22829	4	a	you had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place . . . 
22830	3	a	 . . . and . . . we had sex , too . 
22831	4	a	that is right . don't make any more of it . 
22832	3	a	how ? 
22833	4	a	how what ? 
22834	3	a	how do i not make any more of it ? 
22835	4	a	you could start by concluding this meeting . 
22836	3	a	all right . and she won't say , 'i love you . '
22837	1	a	oh , no . 
22838	0	a	how many dates have you been on ? 
22839	3	a	nine dates . i said it on the second date . 
22840	0	a	mm . 
22841	3	a	yeah , she does all that . 
22842	3	a	no , no . . . 
22843	4	a	michael , do not let your imagination run amok . 
22844	3	a	run what ? 
22845	4	a	amok . it means , don't let your imagination run out of control . 
22846	3	a	why didn't you just say that , pam ? 
22847	4	a	michael , do not let your imagination run out of control . 
22848	3	a	well , that's easy for you to say . you have a bad imagination . it's stupid . i live in a fantasy world . 
22849	2	a	you do ? 
22850	3	a	yes , jim , i do . and i can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit . 
22851	2	a	but you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago . 
22852	3	a	that's what makes it so wrong . 
22853	3	a	ever since i found out that donna might be cheating on me , i have not eaten or slept . this not knowing , that's what's killing me . 
22854	1	a	oh , god , that tickles . what did . . . 
22855	3	a	 i want someone to follow donna . i want her tailed . i need the name of a good private investigator . 
22856	1	a	i think i've got one for you . 
22857	3	a	this is you . how much do you charge ? 
22858	1	a	$100 a day , plus expenses . 
22859	3	a	i'll give you $50 . money's no object . 
22860	1	a	i'm just gonna warn you . . . and i say this to all my clients . . . you might not like what i find . 
22861	3	a	okay . 
22862	1	a	and you might not like how i find it . 
22863	0	a	of course . yeah , that's terrible . okay , let me get back to you . hey , stanley . one of my clients just called and said that their sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire . 
22864	0	a	hey , gabe i need to talk to you about something . it's really important . 
22865	0	a	yeah , i don't know . look , one of my clients called . he was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire . 
22866	0	a	what are we gonna do about this ? 
22867	0	a	let me know what they say . 
22868	0	a	what do you mean ? 
22869	0	a	i don't know . 
22870	1	a	 hi stranger . 
22871	1	a	i work with michael . 
22872	1	a	dwight schrute . 
22873	1	a	all cases are solved with logic . the only logical way to find out if donna is a cheater is to seduce her , bring her to orgasm , then call michael and tell him the sad news .

23050	1	a	alleged contract . 
23051	1	a	just try . i will do legal jujitsu on you . gyah ! see , don't even need to make contact . the law will do it . 
23052	1	a	so much of this is just impossible to verify . item five , point 'b' , uh . . . the beet juice cleanse ? 
23053	1	a	how do we know this ? i'd like to see a stool sample . 
23054	1	a	eughh . 
23055	0	a	no secret crying . hasn't even opened the tissue box in there . 
23056	4	a	could he still be seeing her ? 
23057	2	a	so we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that michael matured overnight ?

23059	2	a	exactly . it happened in big . 
23060	3	a	no , i gotta go . text me later . 
23061	2	a	i'm really too tired to do this . 
23062	4	a	me too ! 
23063	2	a	then let's just not do this . do you have any idea the risks involved ? 
23064	4	a	hey michael . 
23065	3	a	hey . 
23066	4	a	we were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight , in our home , and play with our baby . 
23067	2	a	we can order in from hooters . 
23068	3	a	oh , hooters to go . nice . 
23069	4	a	we can watch a movie and play rock band . 
23070	2	a	billy joel rock band . 
23071	3	a	that . . . exists ? 
23072	4	a	yes . 
23073	3	a	okay , well , i'll have to take a rain check , but thanks for the offer . 
23074	4	a	 michael scott , are you still seeing donna ? 
23075	3	a	okay , pam . . . she's not invisible so stop asking silly questions . 
23076	3	a	since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives ? 
23077	3	a	i like donna . is it wrong to keep seeing her ? depends on who you ask . i mean , if you ask her husband . . . or you took a random poll , yeah , it's wrong . 
23078	3	a	well , i think we all know what you're capable of meredith . 
23079	3	a	people , this is scranton . and many people consider that to be the paris of northeastern pennsylvania . and in paris , it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers . 
23080	3	a	i will have you know that i asked donna about this and she is fine with it . and just to be sure , i asked her again afterward . same answer . 
23081	0	a	how does he feel about it ? 
23082	3	a	he is never gonna find out . he is a high school baseball coach . he wakes up early . he goes to bed early . look at how long it took for him to find out . it was right under his nose . i had to tell him . 
23083	2	a	now you're just being hurtful . 
23084	3	a	i'm sorry , it . . . why is it okay for stanley to cheat or for phyllis to cheat . . . 
23085	3	a	on her diet ! he's a sports guy . he's scummy . dogfighting . drugs . they spit . 
23086	0	a	did donna tell you that ? 
23087	3	a	real sports with bryant gumble . 
23088	0	a	so you're just making a giant assumption . you don't even know the guy . 
23089	3	a	you know what ? you know what ? i am declaring a moment of silence right now . ten minutes of silence honoring michael jackson . just sit there and think about michael jackson . 
23090	0	a	my name is andy bernard and i am a cuckold . for those of you unfamiliar with william shakespeare , a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him . i've lived the part . and let me tell you , i'd so much rather play the part on stage . 
23091	0	a	so . . . here's the thing about infidelity . 
23092	3	a	mm , no , when are you people going to stop casting the first stone ? i am not in the wrong here . i am the good guy . 
23093	0	a	how does that work ? 
23094	3	a	do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy ? do you think he's an angel ? i don't think so . why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me ? there has to be a problem with him . 
23095	0	a	in any cheating movie , the person getting cheated on is the hero . you're ali larter , i'm beyonce . 
23096	3	a	i am beyonce always . 
23097	0	a	not this time . 
23098	3	a	yes , i am .

23103	0	a	oh , really ? i thought you were the boss . 
23104	3	a	let's go . i can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife . i should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her . 
23105	0	a	 bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum

23164	0	a	i get it , man . i love it . that's what makes you a good coach . you know , but as a fan , it just helps me enjoy the game better if i know the coach loves his wife .

23181	0	a	i just wanna go on record as saying that i do not condone this affair , and i went so far as to force michael to confront the victim of his behavior . 
23182	4	a	did you talk to him ? 
23183	3	a	i did . 
23184	4	a	you talked to the man whose wife you're having an affair with .

23202	4	a	you sleep in the warehouse ? 
23203	2	a	okay . 
23204	4	a	okay . 
23205	3	a	because a motel is dirty and it is sexy . like me . and like donna . and frankly , the stuff that we're into isn't very condo-appropriate . 
23206	3	a	okay , morgan freeman-narrating-everything . 
23207	0	a	do you want someone to stop you ? 'cause no one's going to .

23231	0	a	if you say anything , so help me god , i'll break off the temples of your glasses and stick them in your eye sockets . 
23232	0	a	so unfair . even if i thought that our printers killed baby seals , i would not be a whistleblower . the bernards , for generations , have silenced whistleblowers . it's how we made all our money . woody guthrie wrote a song about us . old mr . bernard , old mr . bernard , who have you silenced today ? 
23233	3	a	there is no reason for anyone here to sign this , because i know everything there is to know about these people . i know when their birthdays are , i know what their favorite kind of cake is , i know what color streamers they like . . . 
23234	3	a	yes , yes , but it shows a bigger picture . 
23235	3	a	okay . 
23236	3	a	we should give him a one-way ticket to montego bay , where they keep all the al-qaeda . 
23237	3	a	yes . you put them in jail for a long time , you put them in jail for as long as you can . 
23238	3	a	i want these people to really pay , i want them to suffer . i'd prefer it if they died , 'cause it's not right . 
23239	3	a	okay .

23243	1	a	you're with big brother ? okay , go ahead . i got nothing to hide . 
23244	3	a	ridiculous , angela . and like i'm going to believe one of his spermed lovers . 
23245	1	a	hold that thought . i don't want to waste your time , and i wouldn't dare waste mine . i didn't do it . now , i don't know exactly who did it , but i have a list right here . . . you should fire the following people . 
23246	1	a	why would i disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams ? 
23247	1	a	are you referring to alchemy ? 
23248	1	a	i'm not dumb . i'm smart . 
23249	3	a	is there something that you would like to say to me ? 
23250	0	a	uh . . . 
23251	3	a	about talking to the press ?

23254	0	a	okay ? i , i . . . didn't do it . 
23255	3	a	i don't believe you . 
23256	0	a	i swear on the graves of my parents who aren't even dead yet . 
23257	3	a	that's a little much . all right , all right , all right . 
23258	0	a	i don't care , that's how much i swear ! 
23259	3	a	okay , i believe you , i believe you . 
23260	0	a	i don't know who's giving darryl any crap . he was more bothered about it than me . 
23261	3	a	did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire ? 
23262	3	a	oh , no , no , no . . . 
23263	3	a	oh my god . was she cute ? 
23264	3	a	oh , god , darryl ! 
23265	3	a	i basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it , and then i find out that one of my best ones did . and now he's probably going to get fired for it . and if that is not poetic justice , i don't know what is . 
23266	4	a	it was me . 
23267	2	a	what was you ? you were the leak ? 
23268	4	a	okay . i'm talking to this woman at daycare . . . 
23269	2	a	uh-huh . 
23270	4	a	she's telling me about all her amazing trip to vietnam , i have nothing . i tell her our printers catch on fire , spontaneously ! 
23271	2	a	why'd you do that ? 
23272	4	a	her husband's a reporter . 
23273	2	a	yeah . 
23274	4	a	so now everyone hates andy , and it's this whole mess , and i don't know what to do . 
23275	2	a	okay , just relax . just need to relax . 
23276	4	a	i could tell jo . . . or i could tell michael . 
23277	2	a	this is a very good idea . this is good . let's get all the bad ideas out now . flush them out . 
23278	3	a	you leaked it ? 
23279	4	a	i don't know what to do ! do i go tell jo , or - i don't want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person ! 
23280	3	a	i don't know what the best plan is , pam . oh god . . . my mind is going a mile an hour . 
23281	4	a	that fast ? 
23282	3	a	oh . 
23283	3	a	two whistleblowers . . . two ! i always thought darryl and pam might get me fired for something i said . 
23284	4	a	 yeah ? i weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me . 
23285	3	a	so see you in meredith's van in five minutes . 
23286	4	a	yeah , you didn't need to actually say it . 
23287	4	a	 i have never seen so many parking tickets . 
23288	3	a	no , you know what's messed up ? this situation all up in here is what's messed up ! we need to brainstorm , we need to get out of this ! brain hurricane . come on , think . 
23289	3	a	what do we got ? 
23290	4	a	um . . .

23293	3	a	hey , hey , it's as interesting as a morgue . 
23294	3	a	okay , here's what we do . i say we just smash all the computers . we destroy the evidence . no evidence , no case . 
23295	4	a	wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers ? 
23296	3	a	no . okay , not all the computers , just our computers . 
23297	4	a	i don't think that's a good idea . 
23298	3	a	just don't say no . 
23299	3	a	that's just what we need , another black man in prison . you know , let's just . . . 
23300	4	a	nobody's going to prison , okay ? um . . . all right , michael , you need to convince jo to go easy on us . and then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe . 
23301	3	a	okay . you can count on me . 
23302	1	a	 let me give you a hand . 
23303	1	a	ready ? got it ? oh shoot . got it ? dwight schrute . 
23304	1	a	basement office ? you mean like a lair ? 
23305	3	a	hey jo .

23323	3	a	whole year , actually . my favorite restaurant closed down . 
23324	3	a	and my new favorite restaurant sucks . . . i bought a video camera last year , and i was looking at the tapes , and there were only like twelve minutes that i felt was worth taping the whole year . and most of that was just birds in my condo complex . what is that ? . . . i miss holly . 
23325	3	a	holly flax from the nashua branch . best hr rep that dunder mifflin has ever seen . it's not been a blockbuster year for me financially . my blockbuster stock is down .

23341	0	a	hey . 
23342	0	a	uh , thanks . yeah , you know , just seemed like the right thing to do . 
23343	3	a	that was fun .

23355	4	a	 hey . what are you doing ? 
23356	1	a	from now on , if you're hot , sit on an ice pack . 
23357	1	a	like you'd ever be cold , kevin . stop asking me hypothetical questions , ok ? i'm too busy . 
23358	2	a	hey , dwight , i don't know if you heard , but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups , like regular people . oh , you did hear . 
23359	1	a	 jim , you have one job to do . and you do it forgettably . those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration . 
23360	1	a	dwight schrute , star salesman , beet farmer , bed-and-breakfast proprietor , aspiring freelance bodyguard . add to that list owner of this building . then burn the list . 
23361	0	a	new guy sucks . calls me the nard-man . i'm the nard-dog , okay ? nard-man is my father . 
23362	0	a	that kid is the worst . needs to be fired , michael . 
23363	3	a	he's not the worst , okay ? he's not the worst . you know who's the worst ? that intern we had a few years ago . that guy-remember ? eeeh ! that face , how ugly he was ? he was the worst . good worker , though . ah ! it's not cappuccino . 
23364	3	a	it's just coffee , guys ! but , yeah , i'll look into it , okay ? 
23365	2	a	wow , that's a lot of keys . 
23366	1	a	the bigger the key chain , the more powerful the man . 
23367	2	a	that's right . the janitor said that . by the way , the raccoons are back . 
23368	1	a	where ? 
23369	2	a	i think they run through these panels and then down under the map . i wouldn't know for sure cause i don't have a trained ear . that's why i have to use one of these . 
23370	1	a	give me that . 
23371	2	a	yep . wait , and this . 
23372	1	a	yes . 
23373	2	a	go get 'em . 
23374	2	a	what happened to me this summer ? dwight bought the building , so actually , this has been the busiest summer of my life . 
23375	1	a	 hey , what's so funny over here ? ha . very nice . give me my keys . ha . ha . not . funny . jim . 
23376	4	a	sorry . 
23377	2	a	oh , no . don't worry about it . i was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until christmas . then his pants would have fallen down , which was a little gift to me , but . . . 
23378	4	a	it was really funny . 
23379	2	a	well , it would have been . so unprofessional , mrs . halpert . 
23380	4	a	i love you . 
23381	3	a	okay , rude . luke , i want you to go to the supermarket for me . 
23382	3	a	to get some ice cream for everybody . it's national ice cream afternoon . great . 
23383	3	a	and another thing i did this summer , i hired my nephew . 
23384	3	a	don't bother luke . 
23385	4	a	why is there a circle with a line through it ? 
23386	3	a	that means don't . haven't you seen ghostbusters , pam ? 
23387	3	a	no , it . . . yes , okay , right . all right , yep . my bad . i got it . here we go . 
23388	3	a	come on . okay , um . . . that's as clear as i can make it . 
23389	3	a	because i don't want it getting back to sabre that we're yelling at assistants . i think it would reflect poorly on us . 
23390	1	a	who's gonna tell on us ? gabe ? 
23391	3	a	nope , it won't be gabe but actually , there is somebody in the office that is very , very close to luke . 
23392	1	a	how close ? 
23393	3	a	well , dwight , he wiped his butt . is that close enough for you ? 
23394	1	a	yes . of course . 
23395	3	a	no . no , toby . he's not . yes he is . he's my nephew . 
23396	3	a	luke is my nephew . 
23397	3	a	yes , exactly . that is a very nice way of putting it , oscar . mixing family and business is a beautiful thing . 
23398	3	a	do you think they should have had open auditions for the band hanson ? what if no one named hanson showed up ? that wouldn't even make sense . or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer ? really safe . 
23399	2	a	oh , man , so many points being made . 
23400	3	a	god , when he needed help on earth , who did he hire ? jesus christ , his son . 
23401	3	a	thank you . 
23402	2	a	but you're comparing you and luke to god and jesus . 
23403	3	a	no ! no . i'm just saying , why does god get to do something that i don't ? 
23404	3	a	well , then , why aren't you bugging me to fire everybody who's bad ? you just want me to fire luke . that's reverse nepotism . he should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does ! 
23405	3	a	whoo ! whoo ! whoo ! 
23406	4	a	or enough for everyone ? 
23407	0	a	clutch cream run , bro . 
23408	4	a	get whatever you want , on me . 
23409	2	a	you really think you can make it up to me with food ? 
23410	4	a	i don't know . that usually works . 
23411	4	a	i feel horrible for blowing jim's prank . i don't know if you can tell , but he's mildly upset . and dwight hasn't been messed with in a while , so he's become a monster . i need to make this right . 
23412	3	a	ok , you know what ? just -just back off ! back off ! 
23413	3	a	all right , those might be his . he might own an ebay store . 
23414	2	a	yep . that's exactly what my first thought was . and then i remembered having a conversation with him where he was like , 'i don't own an ebay store , ' so . . . 
23415	3	a	ok , ok . you know what ? this is disgusting . this is like a witch hunt . this is like the blair witch hunt project . 
23416	3	a	i'm reconsidering sending them back anyway . 
23417	0	a	you get that kid to open this car , or i'm gonna do it myself . . . by calling tripple a . 
23418	3	a	wait a minute . 
23419	3	a	don't-all right . well , ok , you've just committed a felony . 
23420	0	a	this kid's costing us sales , michael . 
23421	3	a	no , i know they fit . it's not about the fit . 
23422	3	a	because gabe tattled . i was perfectly happy to just hide it from you . 
23423	3	a	you don't have all the facts . 
23424	3	a	i love him . 
23425	3	a	no . no . he's my nephew . 
23426	3	a	well , this office is my pool . and my house is my house . and i just want my nephew to work in my pool . 
23427	3	a	i will cover his ass like moss on a mississippi tree stump . 
23428	4	a	yeah , yeah . like when he presses 'doors closed' the doors open . or he presses 'lobby' it goes to third floor , stuff like that . can you do that ?

23801	3	a	 good morning erin , any mustaches ? i mean messages ? 
23802	3	a	there are many reasons a man would wear a fake mustache to work . he is a fan of the outrageous . he loves to surprise ! he loves . . . other things as well . 
23803	3	a	 look , it's a pimple phyllis . avrile lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive . 
23804	3	a	you mean cancer ? 
23805	4	a	what ? no ! wait , no . definitely not cancer . 
23806	4	a	it's just good to stop a michael train of thought early before it derails and destroys the entire town .

23808	3	a	just a cold sore , thank you . phyllis , i don't have acne . i have a cold sore . i don't even have a cold . i don't know how i got it . 
23809	3	a	how ? 
23810	3	a	what ? 
23811	4	a	wait ! what you should do , michael , is have a doctor take a look at it . because we really don't know what that is . 
23812	0	a	michael , have you ever been tested for stds ? 
23813	3	a	yeah ! my last physical when i was forty . 
23814	2	a	that was like , ten years ago . 
23815	3	a	no ! it was like four years ago ! 
23816	3	a	why at least ? if you're guessing forty six just say forty six . 
23817	0	a	you know what guys , why don't we just chill out on this herp-chat . ok ? i was an rea in college and i can tell you , number one sexually transmitted disease is ignorance . 
23818	3	a	how did this happen , how did i get this ? 
23819	1	a	some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years , they may not even know they have it . 
23820	3	a	you know what , i feel like one of those old timey sailors . with the eye patch . it's me own damn fault . woman in every port . 
23821	1	a	what port ? the jan port . the holly por . . . 
23822	3	a	don't even ! holly was clean ! okay ? if anything i gave it to her . 
23823	1	a	you may have . . . 
23824	3	a	oh my god ! what if i did ? 
23825	1	a	you need to contact holly ! you need to notify her , that she is crawling with herpes . 
23826	3	a	okay ! you know what ? might ! might be crawling with herpes . i might have gotten it after her . 
23827	1	a	you need to contact every woman you've been with , and notify them of your herpes infestation . it's the right thing to do . 
23828	3	a	there's no way i'm gonna do that . 
23829	1	a	then i will . 
23830	1	a	no , i'm no doctor , but it seems to me that we all have an obligation to the public health to track down anyone who gives us a disease , inform them of it , and take overwhelming revenge on that person . again , i'm no doctor . i'm just a normal guy who enjoys revenge . 
23831	3	a	hi donna . it's michael . 
23832	3	a	i have a disease , for which there is no known cure , that has been sexually transmitted to me . 
23833	3	a	i can't even say it . h-i . . . 
23834	3	a	 . . . r-p-e-e-s

23932	0	a	how is that relevant to anything ?

24071	3	a	stop it . just stop it . we did what we should have done , we just got bested . why is there a door close button if it doesn't even close the door ? 
24072	3	a	how do i feel about losing the sale ? it's like if michael phelps came out of retirement , jumped in the pool , belly-flopped , and drowned . 
24073	3	a	you know who we always lose out to ? staples , the big guys . osprey ? they're a small company . they're smaller than we are . what's our excuse ? how do we combat this guy ? stanley , how do we combat him ? 
24074	3	a	okay . you know what ? you clearly don't care , so why don't you just leave ? 
24075	3	a	why don't you go outside and . . . take a shot of insulin and have a nap , okay ? 
24076	3	a	i don't know , your frame , your build-why don't you have a glass of apple juice and tell me you're not a diabetic . see ? i could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay . yes , phyllis ? 
24077	3	a	oh , my god ! 
24078	1	a	i know how we can learn his tricks . 
24079	1	a	what i am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy . 
24080	2	a	is that your office ? 
24081	1	a	yes , jim . and with a little tweaking , it becomes a different office . we lure danny to it and watch him sell . 
24082	3	a	you know what this is ? this is a stinger . 
24083	2	a	a what ? 
24084	3	a	like the movie . 
24085	2	a	i think you mean the sting . 
24086	3	a	paul newman , robert redford . they're bank robbers . 
24087	2	a	nope . different movie . 
24088	1	a	the sting . the sting . 
24089	2	a	meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company . her lunch break lined up with our appointment with danny and . . . that's it . that's really all we were looking for . 
24090	2	a	meredith van helsing ? 
24091	1	a	van helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer . 
24092	2	a	okay . but what is he more famous for ? 
24093	3	a	shhh ! hey ! that's my mug . 
24094	2	a	you know this isn't real tv , right ? 
24095	3	a	yes . 
24096	0	a	 please mr . president-
24097	0	a	yeah . 
24098	0	a	yeah , but i'm using my falsetto . 
24099	0	a	yeah , well , it'd sound a lot better if you actually sang with some soul . 
24100	0	a	that's a lie . 
24101	0	a	i just was hoping to maybe save your voice in case we did a novelty song about frogs . 
24102	0	a	okay , three-way argument between a drummer , a keyboardist , and the front man lead singer . wonder who's gonna win this one . two , three , four-
24103	3	a	oh , no , no . no . don't-
24104	1	a	people can't keep their true natures hidden for long , and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire . 
24105	3	a	testify . 
24106	2	a	okay , he's not that good-looking . i don't understand why everybody's obsessed with this-
24107	3	a	yeah , he is that good-looking . 
24108	1	a	he's very , very handsome . 
24109	3	a	okay . 
24110	3	a	pull it together , all right ? stop lookin' at him . 
24111	3	a	oh . . . my god ! he's making her sell to him . 
24112	0	a	 okay . honest feedback time . oscar ? 
24113	0	a	but do you think it could be famous ? like in a car commercial or something ? 
24114	4	a	not really . it's kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl . 
24115	0	a	i feel like i can see someone ice skating to it . you know , like in the olympics . 
24116	0	a	rude . and not helpful . 
24117	0	a	well , that . . . really bums me out . 
24118	3	a	stay-

24160	3	a	i can give you more money-there's your better life . i can let you come and go as you please-there's your freedom . and you already know dunder-mifflin has the best service and the best prices , but you beat us anyway . can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff ? 
24161	3	a	everyone , may i have your attention ? i would like to introduce you to mr . danny cordray . he is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman . say hello to danny ! 
24162	3	a	o-kay . you know what ? no . no . this is not some sort of construction site . . . or all of italy , where you can just go around treating people like meat . we are to respect him . i respect him because he reminds me of somebody . can anybody guess who that is ?

24181	3	a	he doesn't need to sit , he's a traveling salesman . look , i am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you . and unless you have a better argument than that , i suggest you leave .

24208	2	a	i don't know . oh ! that's . . . not . . . yours . 
24209	2	a	stanley just drank oj out of my mug , and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee . so the question has to be asked , is there no limit to what he won't notice ? 
24210	0	a	 handbag . 
24211	0	a	shh ! shhh ! 
24212	3	a	 all right , everybody , take a seat . as you may have heard , our branch on the planet jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales ! 
24213	4	a	 bye , stanley ! love you ! 
24214	1	a	 so long , stanley ! 
24215	4	a	people are really into the costume contest this year . might have something to do with the prize , maybe you've heard of it . the 2011 scranton wilkes-barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings ! 
24216	2	a	stop . 
24217	1	a	 too late ! if i was the real scranton strangler , you'd be so strangled right now . if you're out there , strangler , you will get caught ! by me . 
24218	2	a	sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the scranton strangler . 
24219	1	a	to my chickens i'm the scranton strangler . oh-ho ! that's very funny . looks like someone decided to dress up as old dwight schrute's mom . 
24220	4	a	what ? 
24221	1	a	you're only one third as beautiful and only half her height . 
24222	4	a	i'm supposed to be olive oyl . and it makes more sense when i'm standing next to popeye , but . . . jim doesn't want to put his costume on . 
24223	2	a	 i am popeye ! 
24224	2	a	i've never really been a costume guy . even when i was a kid , it just felt like something i was too old for . and then this morning , when pam hands me this little number . . . no . 
24225	3	a	macgruber ! 
24226	3	a	oh , here we go ! 
24227	3	a	 oh ! who likes to water ski on lake erie ? no wai-where does dracula like to water ski ? 
24228	1	a	lake erie . 
24229	3	a	so , wait , drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road ? 
24230	3	a	blackula ! 
24231	3	a	oh , so . . . i almost forgot . you'll find this hilarious . apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now . that's like , exactly sort of the idea that you had . 
24232	3	a	yeah . i'm sorry . i blew this . you should have gotten credit for that , man . 
24233	3	a	really ? we're good ? 
24234	3	a	okay . okay . 
24235	3	a	oh . it's a ream of paper . thought you might hit me . 
24236	3	a	darryl philbin is the greatest guy in the world . and you know what i'd like ? i would like to have all the racists brought together and take darryl philbin out to lunch . just to see what they're missing . 
24237	1	a	pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father . does anyone remember what her dad smelled like ? 
24238	2	a	so four years ago , when i was in stamford , connecticut , and dating someone else , pam went on two dates with danny . which was obviously the greatest love story ever told , given how much people are walking on eggshells around us . 
24239	4	a	we were basically romeo and juliet . 
24240	2	a	that's right . 
24241	4	a	except where juliet doesn't have that great a time and romeo doesn't call back after two dates . 
24242	2	a	yikes . 
24243	4	a	but i've learned to love again . he's a cartoon sailor . 
24244	2	a	oh , no . 
24245	4	a	and looks so handsome in his uniform ! please ? 
24246	2	a	no . no , i'm not gonna-no . 
24247	0	a	tuna ! tuna ! do you want us to skip this party ? 
24248	2	a	i don't care . 
24249	0	a	you know what else ? the-this . . . this sucks for jim . right ? but it also sucks for us . because we don't get invited to a ton of halloween parties . 
24250	0	a	 creed's going ? ! 
24251	2	a	madge from the warehouse just made her first sale . madge . we should have been doing this a long time ago . 
24252	3	a	erin ! would you please do me a solid and get darryl philbin on the speakerphone ? 
24253	3	a	hi , darryl , come out here , please . 
24254	3	a	you need to stop being so shy , come out here , and embrace who you really are , superstar ! 
24255	3	a	yeah , i bet it is ! if you're gonna do your job well here , you gotta get used to being embarrassed . 
24256	4	a	 um , hit the speakerphone button . the speakerphone button ? the same button as you hit before . . . or sit on it . 
24257	3	a	this whole delivery slash sales idea ? you know whose idea that was ? that was darryl philbin's . he thought of that way before the corporate fat suits . 
24258	3	a	i got in the way . i said no . and it just stopped . but then corporate comes up with this idea , but you know what ? they need to know that it was yours . and i don't care if i take a bullet . we're gonna call them , we're gonna put them on speakerphone right now . . . 
24259	3	a	and we are going to straighten this out . 
24260	0	a	screw corporate ! they probably stole the idea anyway . 
24261	3	a	mmhm ! 
24262	3	a	i'm a little peeved at darryl right now . 
24263	1	a	he went to gabe behind your back . 
24264	3	a	no , he didn't go behind my back . he went over my head . 
24265	1	a	he went over your head to go behind your back . 
24266	3	a	what is taking someone from behind ? 
24267	1	a	no . shh . michael , listen . this cannot stand . we can't have workers going straight to corporate . makes your job superfluous . 
24268	3	a	it was a good idea , though . 
24269	1	a	yeah . here's another good idea . corporate chain of command . we need to strangle darryl's idea . 
24270	0	a	hey , danny . 
24271	0	a	i'm really sorry , but we can't come to your party tonight . 
24272	0	a	you were ? 
24273	0	a	we're just like , totally caught in the middle here . 
24274	0	a	well jim and pam basically begged us not to go . . . 
24275	1	a	garbage magnet . garbage magnet , god ! magnets are interesting enough , you don't need to tart them up with some design . i can't believe this doesn't make you mad ! 
24276	3	a	 what the hell are they talking about ? 
24277	1	a	hmm , kevin and gabe . probably about the extremes of the human physique . 
24278	3	a	do you think that kevin is going over my head ? i don't- oh my god . okay . all right . all right . you know what ? that's inappropriate , kevin . i am your boss , and if you have something to say , it goes through me , and then i take it to gabe . chain of command . do you understand ? 
24279	3	a	oh , you're sorry ? 
24280	3	a	what did you just thought ? 
24281	3	a	all right . 
24282	3	a	okay . 
24283	3	a	well , don't let it happen again . 
24284	3	a	i-
24285	2	a	that is crazy . we would never care if andy or kevin went to your party . 
24286	4	a	oh , my gosh ! people keep blowing it out of proportion ! it's not even a history . 
24287	2	a	it's not like you guys had some long relationship right ? big painful breakup i don't know about ? 
24288	4	a	it was two . 
24289	4	a	no , we um , we had plans for a third , but then i don't know , you never called me back , so . . . 
24290	2	a	oooh ! you can't handle the truth ! 
24291	4	a	yeah ? it was though , that's what happened . 
24292	4	a	hmm-mm . 
24293	3	a	okay , this whole going over my head-gate ? is making people act weird . the chain of command is crumbling . do you know what just happened ? i just made kevin cry . and gabe looks like lady gaga . that's not halloween . halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other . 
24294	3	a	you went over my head . and then you lied to my face . so my head and my face have taken a beating . 
24295	3	a	okay , that might help . if you said 'i'm sorry' in front of everybody . 
24296	3	a	in front of me . 
24297	3	a	so that's it . 
24298	3	a	is it ? 
24299	0	a	sookehhh . bill compton , from true blood . 
24300	4	a	okay , everybody ! after you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book . and you can't vote for yourself . 
24301	3	a	yeah , i gotta get in on this . hey , it's cool , man , i work in the warehouse ! i'm cool ! i'm hip and i'm jive ! and i don't care about nobody ! do you know who i am ? happy halloween , jerk ! 
24302	3	a	still don't know who i am ? i'll give you a hint . i go over other people's heads . 
24303	4	a	michael , this is a bad idea . 
24304	3	a	what's a bad idea ? 
24305	4	a	dressing up as somebody-i mean , when has that ever worked for you ? 
24306	3	a	never ! okay , you know what ? fine . i'm not darryl . and thank god i'm not darryl . 
24307	4	a	angela as the nurse ! 
24308	3	a	hey , can i play ? why don't you ask if darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back ? 
24309	2	a	we have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that ? 
24310	3	a	aaah ! darryl moved it . you moved it . 
24311	3	a	dwight , you saw darryl move it , right ? 
24312	1	a	let's just say i saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see . 
24313	1	a	i know how to sit on a fence . hell , i can even sleep on a fence . the trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth . 
24314	3	a	if you had one word you would use to describe darryl what would that word be ? 
24315	2	a	hey . 
24316	2	a	when you work hard , you play hard around here . even if you don't work hard . oh , here's something . uh , why didn't you ever call pam back ? 
24317	2	a	yeah . i mean , i'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love , or anything , i'm just saying . . . but you know , to not even call her back is . . . 
24318	2	a	could be . but you also called her the second time so you had the number right . 
24319	2	a	nope . 
24320	4	a	i'd remember talking about jim . that wasn't it . 
24321	2	a	just tell her the real reason . 
24322	2	a	hey . she had a nice time . it seems rude . 
24323	4	a	i did . and it's just one of those things that's going to keep gnawing at me , like 'gnaw , gnaw , why ? why didn't he ? i have no idea why . '
24324	2	a	hey , man . 
24325	4	a	thank you ! thank you . i got it . now i know . you thought i was a little dorky . you know ? okay . well , excuuuuse me . 
24326	3	a	thank you . 
24327	3	a	if they're good ideas , i'm not gonna say no ! 
24328	3	a	that was-okay , you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals , after everything i did for you ? 
24329	3	a	oh . . . 
24330	3	a	well . . . 
24331	3	a	stop it ! stop , stop . we're thinking . we're thinking about it . 
24332	3	a	you don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it . stop it ! just let us think . okay , next time you have a really great idea , we will put it in a hat , and then we will have erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide . 
24333	3	a	i am not budging on the hat issue . 
24334	3	a	okay . we both reserve the right to go to jo if we disagree with gabe . 
24335	3	a	unless you and i decide we want to talk to jo , then we'll give her a call . 
24336	3	a	sorry i was a jerk . 
24337	3	a	friends fight . friends fight . 
24338	0	a	what's up , man ? 
24339	0	a	when i was a freshman in college , i worked at the student newspaper , the cornell daily sun ? this was at cornell . i had to write an op-ed column every day . bernard's regards . 
24340	2	a	to be honest , i still can't believe he didn't call her back . who doesn't call a dork like that back ? 
24341	4	a	oh , wow ! 
24342	2	a	 spinach in a can . power eat spinach . 
24343	4	a	aww , my hero ! 
24344	4	a	okay , everyone , i've tallied the votes , and the winner . . . of the costume celebration spectacular . . . and the scranton wilkes-barre coupon book . . . oscar martinez . 
24345	4	a	i know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately . it's that time of year . and according to a study done by the university of arizona , they've discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria , per square inch , than a toilet seat . 
24346	3	a	that's true , that's true . i dated her momma , and you know what-
24347	2	a	stop . 
24348	3	a	 um . . . kay . uh , alright . 
24349	4	a	one of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough . 
24350	4	a	oh , no , it's just that if a vampire had to cough , he would do it like this . 
24351	1	a	uh-huh . right . and ruin their cloaks ? do you have any idea how expensive wool is in transylvania ? 'cause of the euro . 
24352	4	a	well , other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly . don't come in if you're sick . 
24353	1	a	 uh . . . 
24354	4	a	and get your flu shot . also , i'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office . 
24355	1	a	no , no , no . they will cost you your life . 
24356	2	a	elaborate . 
24357	1	a	the worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it . they need to fight their own battles . if sabre really cared about our well-being , they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations . a simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt , vomit , fecal matter . . . 
24358	4	a	i'm not - i'm not going to do that . i'm not going to do that . 
24359	1	a	exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger . 
24360	2	a	so by that rationale , if i had to sneeze , i should just sneeze on you . 
24361	1	a	yes . i would welcome it . 
24362	2	a	 you're welcome . 
24363	1	a	the principle is sound . to avoid illness , expose yourself to germs , enabling your immune system to develop antibodies . i don't know why everyone doesn't do this . maybe they have something against living forever . 
24364	4	a	cece's getting christened today . 
24365	2	a	big day . 
24366	4	a	everyone from work is here . we weren't planning on that . 
24367	2	a	nope . 
24368	3	a	top of the sunday morning to you . 
24369	0	a	and a top of the day to you too , sir . 
24370	3	a	oh , yes . doobie-doobie doo . 
24371	3	a	i invited everyone in the office because it's not a day for just jim or pam or the baby or me . it is about us all . and i thought we should all celebrate . . . my joy . and our , all of ours joys . 
24372	0	a	 ah , man . 
24373	0	a	does the nard-dog want nard-pups ? yeah . i want a big ol' litter of nard-pups . all jumping around , sucking on the teet . put 'em in a box , give 'em to my neighbors . yeah , i want kids . 
24374	1	a	 for all your paper and printer needs . for all your paper and printer needs . for all your paper and printer needs . 
24375	3	a	 hey . hey . i got an offer that you can't refuse . scooch over . 
24376	4	a	oh , michael , this is just for family . 
24377	3	a	but i'm the godfather . 
24378	2	a	it is really funny , but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather . 
24379	3	a	are you talking to me ? 
24380	2	a	 ok , your turn . 
24381	3	a	scooch . before i shoot you in the head . 
24382	4	a	okay , michael . um , you know i love when you do that voice , but today , i'm so sorry . i need you to tell me that you know you're not cece's godfather . 
24383	3	a	yeah . 
24384	4	a	i'm sorry , michael . i need you to say it . i'm so sorry . 
24385	3	a	 i'm not the godfather . 
24386	4	a	okay , thank you . 
24387	3	a	 so who is the godfather ? 
24388	4	a	our friend , seth , and his wife there . 
24389	3	a	okay . old friend , like , you've known him since kindergarten ? 
24390	4	a	no , i met his wife in mommy and me . they're a great couple . you should meet them later . 
24391	3	a	no , i have plenty of friends , so . . . all right , well , you have great seats . enjoy the show . 
24392	4	a	okay . thank you for coming , michael . 
24393	3	a	i don't even know how to say this , but cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h . and that's not true , but her parents are kind of boxing me out . 
24394	3	a	good morning . 
24395	4	a	 somebody needs a change . 
24396	2	a	right now ?

24408	4	a	you said you checked it . 
24409	2	a	i did . . . say that . 
24410	3	a	jim and pam and cece really seem to be clicking . they are totally gelling . it's as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness . and good for them . that's great , because , you know , the paper industry's not gonna last forever . 
24411	2	a	mm . no . wrong on both counts . 
24412	2	a	okay , 'a , ' halbert . and , 'b , ' i think a more appropriate statement would be , 'the 'halberts' are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests . '

24425	4	a	 hm . don't listen to her . she's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home to someone as cute as you . 
24426	2	a	huh , you think she is jealous about having a baby ?

24707	3	a	i think an investor's ski trip is the best idea . it will be a bonding experience . 
24708	3	a	i was looking at a trail map , and i was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill , because i've never actually been skiing . and then work our way up to death drop . 
24709	3	a	your kidding ? ! 
24710	3	a	you and me . 
24711	3	a	don't you work here full-time ?

24722	2	a	i am on the first hot sale streak of my life . i think it all comes from feeding cece , because no matter how much she resists , i sell her those carrots . let's be honest--if i can make mushed carrots seem better than a boob . . . i can pretty much sell anything . 
24723	2	a	mm-kay , well , it can't be zero , kev . 
24724	2	a	what are you talking about ? we--we have a commission cap ?

24848	4	a	umm , stanley . maybe you could just unspool a little more each time you need to . . . 
24849	1	a	stanley , as a fellow dunder mifflin employee i feel for you . but , like you , i am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner . 
24850	2	a	which is you . 
24851	1	a	which is you' is not a sentence . 
24852	2	a	i disagree with . 
24853	4	a	dwight , can we talk about these cutbacks . 
24854	1	a	pam , when i'm sitting at this desk , i'm a salesman . if you wanna talk to the new building owner , you should call nate and schedule and appointment . 
24855	4	a	i'm not going to do that . 
24856	1	a	well then you're not going to talk to the new building owner . which is a shame , because i hear he's a very reasonable guy . 
24857	4	a	hi nate , its pam halpert . 
24858	4	a	hey , i would just love to schedule a meeting today with dwight . 
24859	4	a	sure .

24861	4	a	 dwight . dwight . can you please tell new building owner that he is screwing over all the people he works with , people he's worked with for years . his friends . 
24862	1	a	you know what pam ? you're right . this isn't just a business . this is a home , and i would much rather see a smile from kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity . 
24863	3	a	what ? 
24864	3	a	so much for keeping our secrets up high . 
24865	3	a	i know what we're going to do . we're going to put our best minds on it . 
24866	3	a	everybody stop working . i want you all to imagine a world in which america is not the number one superpower , where forks are irrelevant , and where every man , woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello . now open your eyes . 
24867	3	a	welcome to your future . 
24868	3	a	how do we stop it ? with a big idea . that's what america is built on , big ideas . blue jeans , the grand canyon . whose got one , whose got a big idea ? 
24869	4	a	an idea bigger than the grand canyon ? 
24870	3	a	yes , indeed . yes kevin . 
24871	3	a	once a week antacid is the idea to beat . anyone else ? nobody ? okay then we are . . . yes . 
24872	3	a	i don't know . 
24873	3	a	alright . 
24874	3	a	i don't know what the that was . 
24875	1	a	i say we bomb 'em . by 2020 , they're gonna be the world's largest economy and they're getting a taste for protein . we'll all starve . 
24876	3	a	no he's not right . we're not . where would we even drop it , phyllis ? did you know that in china there are fifty six cities with over a million people ? you know how many we have here ? nine . 
24877	3	a	no , no . that is right now . 
24878	3	a	in terms of land , not population . 
24879	3	a	no , no you're wrong about this . 
24880	3	a	i got it from newyorktimes . com
24881	2	a	okay , someone look it up . 
24882	0	a	well are you ? 
24883	2	a	well on the plus side all this worrying about china has made you smarter than oscar , michael . 
24884	3	a	so i happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office . so what ? i don't care . 
24885	3	a	okay , now where were we before i bested oscar ? 
24886	3	a	absolutely , pam this is exactly why i hired you as office administrator , handle it . taking care of business . 
24887	4	a	dwight take it down . 
24888	4	a	i'm serious , take it down or else . 
24889	1	a	or else ? or else what ? there's nothing you can do . 
24890	4	a	we can move out . 
24891	4	a	so , does anyone wanna know where i've been for the last 2 hours ? 
24892	2	a	oh god , i've been playing zombie soccer for two hours ? 
24893	4	a	i went out to look for a better office space . 
24894	1	a	waste of time . 
24895	4	a	not really , because i found one . 
24896	2	a	oh wow , these are nice . 
24897	4	a	yup . 
24898	1	a	let me see . 
24899	4	a	look at the huge offices jim , check out that conference room . 
24900	2	a	yeah , yeah . totally . 
24901	1	a	you can't just move out . 
24902	4	a	oh in three months we can . check the lease , and if you don't undo all the changes you've made , we're moving . hey guys , can i show you some pictures . 
24903	0	a	 oh my gosh she is so cute . she looks like both of you . 
24904	4	a	they're not of cece . 
24905	0	a	oh , cool . 
24906	4	a	this is possibly our new dunder mifflin office . 
24907	4	a	well , this building isn't far , and its much newer . there's a dry cleaner , nail place and a gym . oh , and it's next-door to and outback so it always smells like steak . 
24908	4	a	koreans . 
24909	4	a	white . 
24910	2	a	woah , there is a lot of brainpower in this room . we've got michael and oscar , the two smartest guys in the office , also in that order . 
24911	3	a	very comedically humorous jim . 
24912	3	a	try 'control p' . 
24913	3	a	not if the printer isn't hooked up . you are making some very dangerous assumptions oscar . 
24914	2	a	around here , oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts , or correct grammar . he really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay mexican . 
24915	0	a	megan fox ! come on ! 
24916	0	a	yes , but one good text away from a high five . 
24917	0	a	oh , its on . 
24918	1	a	in your perfect would , what would make this building awesome ? i'm putting together kind of a wish list . 
24919	1	a	yeah , no . i'm not a genie . i'm just talking about a . . . 
24920	1	a	you can't possibly be serious . 
24921	3	a	hey . 
24922	3	a	mmm . 
24923	3	a	yeah . 
24924	3	a	sure . 
24925	2	a	woah , woah , woah . do you know what you just agreed to ? 
24926	3	a	coffee jim . 
24927	2	a	no . 
24928	0	a	it is not just coffee . 
24929	2	a	he's trying to set you up michael . what's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way , but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up , and when he does , boom , its awful . haven't you noticed that i don't bring up the tour de france around him ? 
24930	3	a	yes . 
24931	0	a	and then he will smugly pay the cheque and make you feel so small . 
24932	3	a	alright , well i just need to learn everything about china . to be safe i should learn everything about everything but i don't have time . okay , okay , i'll just learn about china and science and geography and math and literary . 
24933	2	a	no politics ? 
24934	3	a	i'm pretty good on politics . 'california is bankrupt , and california , california . ' what ? 
24935	1	a	parley , my office , five minutes . 
24936	4	a	parley ? 
24937	4	a	so everyone here knows pirate code ? 
24938	1	a	pam , i am not an unreasonable man . if you guys stay , i will stop watering down the soap . 
24939	4	a	you've been watering down the soap ? 
24940	1	a	why do you even need soap ? are you that bad at going to the bathroom ? 
24941	4	a	we need everything back the way it was . 
24942	1	a	you don't wanna move . moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life . you'll probably just take it out on your kid . jim will turn to the drink . the family will fall apart , and twenty five years from now , cece will become world famous . . . for stripping . 
24943	3	a	pass . 
24944	3	a	pass . 
24945	2	a	two for two , keep it up . 
24946	3	a	lifeline . 
24947	0	a	damn it . michael , you are moments away from the smack down of your life . if you don't know something , steer the conversation back to something you do know . 
24948	3	a	i could talk about boobs . i bet he knows nothing about boobs . 
24949	2	a	what do you know about boobs ? 
24950	0	a	michael , i have to tell you something it's from rocky ii . 
24951	2	a	thank you . 
24952	0	a	this guy doesn't just wanna win . y'know , he want's to bury you . he wants to humiliate you ! 
24953	3	a	wait , wait , wait . how long is this going to take ? 
24954	0	a	i'm like a quarter of the way through . 
24955	3	a	is it going to be worth it ? 
24956	0	a	no . 
24957	3	a	i don't need to cheat . 
24958	2	a	show him how to use it . 
24959	1	a	here it is , right here , pull over . oh my god . no way . man , look at that . 
24960	1	a	there's no building . this could only mean one thing .

24963	1	a	oh . 
24964	1	a	i'm sorry . we have a colleague with the same name .

24966	1	a	damn it , pam . get out . right now . leave it , i mean it . get the hell out of here . go . 
24967	1	a	i can't wait to do to pam , what i just did . . . to pam .

24969	4	a	yeah ? 
24970	1	a	y'know what , i'm the only one here who you haven't asked about the new office . 
24971	4	a	i know , because you're the reason we're moving . 
24972	1	a	yeah , but i'm still an employee here , and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery . what's the square footage in the new place ? 
24973	4	a	uhh , i think it's something like umm . . . 
24974	1	a	what's the exact square footage . 
24975	4	a	umm , let me see . 
24976	1	a	how many offices are there ? oh i'll just look at the one sheet myself . 
24977	4	a	oh , actually i don't know what i did with the one sheet . y'know , that's the problem . you only have one sheet . 
24978	1	a	 you're a funny guy pam . what's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office ? i'm going to walk down the hall and say 'wow , i can't believe this is real , but it is . ' i can't wait . 
24979	4	a	mmhmm . 
24980	4	a	i lied about some aspects of the building . 
24981	2	a	it's still on a bike path though right ? 
24982	4	a	there's no building . . . it doesn't exist . 
24983	2	a	what does that mean ? 
24984	4	a	i needed leverage so i pulled those pictures off the internet . it's just this office administrator thing , i don't wanna . . . 
24985	2	a	what ? 
24986	4	a	fail . i don't want to fail . . . again .

24989	2	a	and you didn't fail those things either . 
24990	4	a	well , i'm not an artist , and i'm not a salesman . so what would you call it ? 
24991	2	a	hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . 
24992	3	a	did you know , that china has a new missile , that can sink a us naval carrier nine hundred miles off the coast ? 
24993	3	a	did you also know that china has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal . but what do i know , i mean , that's just according to the pentagon . our pentagon .

25115	3	a	yes , that's me . come on it . 
25116	3	a	 there's nothing classier than boring jazz music . i am here to tell ya . and i made a bit of a judgment call . i hired one musician , because i thought , what's better , to hire an entire quartet for half an hour , or one bassist for the entire day ? 
25117	4	a	hey , uh , any volunteers to come with me to go buy a christmas tree ? 
25118	4	a	why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party ? no one invited girls . it's just us . 
25119	0	a	i will help . although my 'brid' , my hybrid , my prius hybrid , won't fit a tree . which is ironic , considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis . 
25120	0	a	i do , however , have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup . 
25121	4	a	oh , do you mean darryl ? that's a great idea . i'll ask him .

25126	0	a	it's cool , darryl , i'm here too . 
25127	4	a	hey , sorry , i really didn't want to come in . it's just that we have to go buy a new christmas tree , and we're hoping we could borrow your truck . 
25128	0	a	come on , it'll be fun . we could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back . 
25129	4	a	okay . sorry . we'll uh , we'll leave you alone . 
25130	3	a	when holly gets here , i want you to be very helpful to her . 
25131	3	a	she doesn't need an internet presence , you just know . 
25132	3	a	what the hell are you doing here ? you're supposed to be in the courthouse . 
25133	3	a	and then he will come back here and replace holly , so stop asking him questions . 
25134	1	a	 you've reached the voice mail of dwight kurt schrute . please leave . . .

25160	3	a	you know who my favorite character in toy story is ? andy's mom . 
25161	3	a	because without andy's mom , there's no plot . and without any plot , there is no movie . 
25162	3	a	you're kidding me . ahh ! 
25163	3	a	what a douche bag ! 
25164	3	a	get a . . . yeah ! good riddance . 
25165	3	a	mmhmm .

25168	3	a	oh , you do ? 
25169	3	a	 yeah , randy newman's the best . 
25170	3	a	me too . 
25171	0	a	 christmas tree , christmas tree . won't you be my christmas tree . 
25172	4	a	hey , how about this one ? 
25173	0	a	ehh , seems a little full of itself , right ? kind of a pretty boy ? what if we got a really beat up one , like on charlie brown . and we just loved it for what it is ? 
25174	4	a	maybe . i mean . . . 
25175	4	a	um , hey , darryl , listen , it's none of my business , but if i couldn't have cece for christmas , i'd be really upset too . 
25176	0	a	i don't have kids or anything , but if my grandmother ever dies , i'm going to kill myself . 
25177	4	a	well darryl , no kid wants to buy their own christmas presents . 
25178	4	a	no , you should have her mom do the boring christmas stuff on her time . you should be associated with the fun parts of christmas . 
25179	4	a	bring her to the party . yeah , we'll have santa , and we'll play games with her . it'll be a lot of fun . 
25180	0	a	yes . 
25181	4	a	you'll be mr . christmas by the end of the night . 
25182	4	a	hey guys , the tree's here . 
25183	3	a	hey . 
25184	0	a	nobody hug me , i'm covered in tree sap , so . . . 
25185	3	a	hey there , jada . nice to see you again . i'm santa claus . welcome . 
25186	3	a	it's a sophisticated take . 
25187	3	a	yeah , well , i was told that holly would be here , single and ready to date . and we all got misled . 
25188	4	a	who told you that ? 
25189	3	a	nora ephron , in every romantic comedy ever made . 
25190	4	a	kelly ! um , how are you adjusting to the move ? 
25191	4	a	you guys , i don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving holly personal advice about her love life . 
25192	4	a	wow , an ultimatum . 
25193	4	a	it doesn't really seem like you . 
25194	2	a	don't . stop , dwight ! dwight , stop ! dwight , stop ! 
25195	1	a	oh , no . oh , no ! 
25196	2	a	stop ! 
25197	1	a	oh , no . yes , taste my wrath ! 
25198	2	a	okay . okay . okay . 
25199	1	a	huh ? you like that ? 
25200	2	a	seriously ! 
25201	1	a	huh ? 
25202	2	a	okay . okay . 
25203	1	a	yes , i have a wig for every single person in the office . you never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone . 
25204	2	a	i just want it to stop . 
25205	4	a	so , cool right ? 
25206	4	a	okay . 
25207	4	a	okay , well , i just sorta meant , like , cute , right ? 
25208	4	a	i mean , help , if it's something simple , like add page numbers or laminate it or . . . 
25209	4	a	no . 
25210	2	a	hey , toby . 
25211	2	a	no way . 
25212	2	a	that's increadible . 
25213	2	a	you know what's crazy ? 
25214	2	a	i can't reconnect with you right now . hold on one second . excuse me . 
25215	3	a	i guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer , and some people you don't . and that's just the way it is . and i can be mature about that . 
25216	3	a	what if meredith was taking her smoking break below that window ? you know what would have happened ? the shards of glass would have shaved her face right off . and , yes , it might have been funny . but it also would have been incredibly tragic . 
25217	1	a	i could not agree more . and just want to state for the record that i am intending to sue jim for acute psychological distress . 
25218	2	a	what are you talking about ? you're the one terrorizing me . 
25219	1	a	with snowballs , jim ? with fluffy little snowballs ? no . i thought we were just playing . 
25220	3	a	all this arguing reminds me of a very funny story . you see this on my desk ? know who gave me this ? my girlfriend tara , who lives in new york city . 
25221	1	a	wait , what girlfriend ? 
25222	3	a	i haven't told you about her . 
25223	1	a	i find that unlikely . you email me when you get a new zit . 
25224	3	a	i do . she is . 
25225	3	a	did you see her face ? well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for michael g . scott . and it ain't tara . 
25226	4	a	yup . 
25227	4	a	no , no . jim had a great year , actually . i just wanted to get your opinion . 
25228	4	a	look at this . 
25229	3	a	what happened ? what happened ? toby , what did you do ? i think toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting . 
25230	3	a	oh , really ? turn it on me . well , isn't that nice ? thank you very much . 
25231	3	a	it is christmas . 
25232	3	a	mmhmm . mmhmm . well , the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me . and that i have been framed . 
25233	0	a	why would anyone frame you for that ? 
25234	2	a	okay , i'm sorry , why are we discounting this whole 'woody came to life' thing so quickly ? 
25235	3	a	ahhhhhh ! surprise ! it was part of the party . pretty funny , huh ? 
25236	3	a	 i don't . but someday i think we will laugh about this . . . when we tell our kids . . . 
25237	2	a	yikes . 
25238	1	a	dear god in heaven . 
25239	3	a	all right . shh . okay , you know what ? holly , i didn't mean to do it . it was an accident . an accident borne of jealous feelings . 
25240	3	a	oh , really ? you certainly seemed jealous when i told you about my fake girlfriend . that's what jim and dwight thought . 
25241	1	a	okay , hey , hey , hey . . . 
25242	2	a	no , fake girlfriends are always wrong . 
25243	3	a	when you got transferred , and i drove you up to nashua , you said , 'michael , i love you , but i can't do this . ' but then , with this other guy , you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship , do you ? and you know what , that is what is the matter with me . 
25244	3	a	and we did this whole stupid party for you . 
25245	3	a	mmm . erin , would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me , please ? 
25246	2	a	 'hey , pickles , merry christmas . open immediately . love , swiss cheese . ' damn it , dwight ! 
25247	1	a	didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing , did you , jim ? let that be a lesson to you all . 
25248	4	a	jada , darryl , i'm so glad i found you guys . a grinch stole the star from on top of the christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere . you want to go help me find him ? 
25249	4	a	oh , my goodness . 
25250	0	a	i am the mean old grinch . the little girl who wishes to win back the christmas star must first succeed at these challenges . 
25251	0	a	wahhh . . . 
25252	4	a	something like an obstacle course , mr . grinch ? 
25253	0	a	no . you must answer topical political questions . how many congressmen is the state of pennsylvania guaranteed ? and what other state has the equal number ? 
25254	0	a	do you know the other state ? 
25255	0	a	the star has been hidden . is the little girl hot or cold ? well , it turns out she's burning up because the star is right behind her ear ! 
25256	3	a	hey
25257	3	a	nice to see you again , aj . welcome . 
25258	3	a	good trip down ? 
25259	3	a	good , good . good to see you . have fun . enjoy the partay . 
25260	3	a	i am dead inside . 
25261	4	a	thank you . 
25262	4	a	 i don't think he's in the ceiling , babe . 
25263	2	a	well , uh . . . i don't think any of us really know . alright . 
25264	4	a	is it . . . is it pebbles from that beach in jamaica ? 
25265	2	a	ooh , go easy with the shaking . 
25266	4	a	 oh , my god . 
25267	2	a	you like it ? 
25268	4	a	i love it . 
25269	2	a	yup , i do make great christmas gifts . but i couldn't make that . 
25270	2	a	alright , my turn . 
25271	4	a	oh , um , it's just , i didn't , i didn't have a lot of time , so that's just a place holder . 
25272	2	a	right . of course . 'the adventures of jimmy halpert . ' oh , my god . this is awesome ! that's my bike . that's my desk . and that is my daughter . 
25273	2	a	i mean . . . 
25274	4	a	michael , wait ! 
25275	3	a	oh , hey , hey , no , don't run . you're gonna slip . 
25276	4	a	that's good advice . 
25277	3	a	yup . i read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice , and she hit her head and went into a coma forever . and then every day , her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died . 
25278	4	a	that's a sad story . 
25279	3	a	 yeah , well , at least he was married . 
25280	4	a	oh , okay , michael , slow down . everything's gonna be okay . 
25281	3	a	no , it's not . it's not . oh , man , i can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay . 
25282	4	a	i shouldn't tell you this , but . . . aj won't commit to holly . and she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year , it's over . 
25283	3	a	really ? 
25284	4	a	really . and i don't know about you , but i don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum , do you ? 
25285	3	a	no . 
25286	4	a	so just be patient . 
25287	3	a	yeah . i mean , i can wait till then . come here . i don't want you to fall . 
25288	2	a	i surrender . 
25289	1	a	i do not accept your surrender . there's only one way that i would ever relent . 
25290	2	a	anything . you got it . 
25291	1	a	you hit pam in the face with a snowball while i watch . 
25292	2	a	you're a psychopath . 
25293	1	a	i'll take that as a no . 
25294	3	a	i was in the mall , and i saw that , and i thought it had your name written all over it . 
25295	3	a	no , that's not . . . no , i went to the mall and i picked that out especially for you . 
25296	3	a	 from the mall . that . . . 
25297	3	a	well , that . . .

25302	3	a	i think i know where he is .

25427	1	a	i am not going back until i fulfill my resolution .

25430	0	a	hey , there's a roller rink across the street ! there's always chicks at the rink .

25435	4	a	cool ! here's a little 'way to go' gift from sabre . 
25436	4	a	creed . i noticed you don't have a resolution on the board . what's yours ? 
25437	4	a	how is it going ? 
25438	4	a	one of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them . in fact , most resolutions are abandoned by february . 
25439	3	a	or sooner . 
25440	4	a	yeah . 
25441	3	a	that's not a joke . 
25442	4	a	but that's okay . because it's not about being perfect , it's about trying . in fact , why don't we go around and confess some of the ways that we've fudged on some of our resolutions ? 
25443	4	a	okay , well , my confession is that today i had a sip of coffee . but that's fine . 
25444	3	a	is it ? 
25445	4	a	yes ! because with all of your support , by this time next year maybe i'll be down to one glass of iced tea a week . 
25446	3	a	next year ? come-i mean , what is the point ? what is the point of that ? i made a resolution to floss , and i did it . 12:01 , january first , bam ! blood everywhere . 
25447	3	a	what is wrong with you people ? can't you stick to anything ? erin , i want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables . creed , you say you want to do a cartwheel ? nothing's stopping you . come on , old man , do a cartwheel ! 
25448	3	a	you're just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what's going to be on your tombstone ? loser . 
25449	3	a	just do a cartwheel ! 
25450	3	a	 eat it . 
25451	4	a	you don't have to do that , kevin . 
25452	3	a	no . no cheese whiz , no hollandaise , no chocolate sauce , just eat it . come on . here comes the airplane , there you go . open , open , into the hanger , there you go . 
25453	4	a	oh , michael . 
25454	3	a	eat it . put it in your mouth , and just eat it . 
25455	3	a	i don't care whether you hate it ! you said you'd do it ! 
25456	3	a	eat it ! 
25457	3	a	all right , all right , shh ! 
25458	3	a	let me see if you swallowed it , open your mouth . under your tongue . oh , god ! you guys are pathetic . 
25459	3	a	no ! you can't have any candy ! 
25460	4	a	okay , michael , just settle down . 
25461	3	a	 holly flax . 
25462	3	a	 not michael , e . t . 
25463	3	a	well , i just want to talk about what happened in there . 
25464	3	a	holly , come on in . thanks for coming . i thought there should be an hr rep here for this . so , kevin and creed , things got a little bit intense in the conference room . 
25465	3	a	and i wanted to apologize . these resolutions should be about you , and i made it about me , and it was none of my beeswax . 
25466	3	a	it was insensitive and i am sorry . 
25467	3	a	i really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions . the cartwheel , the veggies . . . i . . . care about you . very much . and you loom so large in my heart that i crossed the line . 
25468	3	a	you're right . and i hope that we can still be friends . 
25469	3	a	okay , oh ! all right . 
25470	3	a	okay .

25485	3	a	yup . 
25486	3	a	you can toss them . 
25487	3	a	my resolution ? i never want to make holly cry again . unless it's from laughing too hard . or making love too beautifully . 
25488	3	a	look at where you're going to be doing the cartwheel . so look at where you're going to be placing your hands . so pick a spot . 
25489	3	a	you ready to do this ? 
25490	3	a	you know what ? i'm going to stay here as long as it takes . 
25491	3	a	it's about you . it's about you . go !

25498	3	a	i'm working on an english character . would you mind gi . . . it's called reginald pooftah .

25500	3	a	i do ping . herrow . i ping ! 
25501	3	a	no , no , no . and people don't understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality . 
25502	3	a	that's good . pleasure to meet you . 
25503	3	a	dunder mifflin . 
25504	3	a	no , not right now . 
25505	3	a	all right . see you around . 
25506	3	a	bye-bye . what a nice guy . 
25507	0	a	that's actually 'master of ceremonies' bernard . 
25508	0	a	last year , i went to a seminar called 'the ten secrets of real estate' . turns out it was just a ploy to sell me time-shares in idaho . cut to , you know , spending a weekend in boise , terrible time , super lonely . but i get to thinking maybe i should put on my own seminar to lure clients . 
25509	3	a	 hello , i am here for the small business seminar . 
25510	3	a	nein ! i'm greek ! my name is mikanos . 
25511	3	a	okay . 
25512	3	a	i am the plant . every great seminar has one . my job is to make the speaker look good , and i do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes . and the character 'mikanos' , is just a little added flava . 'mikanos' is loosely based on another character i do , 'spiros' , who is more about the ladies . 
25513	0	a	thank you so much tuna turner . you are simply the best . 
25514	2	a	listen , this isn't a favor , all right ? this is a good idea . we all win . 
25515	0	a	go higher . i get super flexible when i'm nervous . 
25516	2	a	wow . stop , stop , stop , stop , stop , stop . hey , andy , i'm really , really sorry to do this to you , but i have a meeting today that i totally forgot , so i can't be apart of this seminar . 
25517	0	a	no . what ? you can't do that . you are a critical part of this seminar . you're the charming warm-up guy , 
25518	2	a	i know . 
25519	0	a	if the seminar was a meal , you'd be the amuse-bouche . you like , signal the flavors of the whole night . 
25520	2	a	i'm really sorry . i can't do it . 
25521	0	a	you can't . you can't . 
25522	0	a	i can't have this go badly . i'm a terrible salesman , and i haven't been making very many sales lately , or ever . this is my only idea on how to turn things around . if it goes badly , i might lose my job , which would suck because this is the only job i've ever been good at . 
25523	2	a	will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over ? 
25524	4	a	what's going on ? do you know that guy ? 
25525	2	a	i just have a meeting , uh , outside the office .

25535	1	a	you promised us whales . these are worms . 
25536	0	a	they're not worms , dwight , okay ? they're just people with tiny businesses . they're baby whales which is even cuter . 
25537	0	a	stanley , you're suppose to close . 
25538	0	a	what ? i already lost jim . salesmen are suppose to help each other out . we're suppose to be a team . 
25539	1	a	we're no more a team than the people staying in the same hotel are a team . 
25540	3	a	you know what might be kind of fun ? i was thinking , you know andy is having a seminar today ? what if we went in as a greek couple ? mikanos and . . . 
25541	3	a	okay . 
25542	3	a	 if-a you change-a you mind , why don't you talk to mikanos ? 
25543	3	a	ugh . you're the fifth person to tell me that today . 
25544	3	a	okay , yeah , like a character history . good . tom hanks does that . 
25545	4	a	jelp ? ' j-e-l-p ?

25549	4	a	k-a . 'ka' ? what does 'ka' mean ?

25854	3	a	anything goes . 
25855	1	a	michael , that's absurd . what if two couples want to go at the same time ? 
25856	3	a	okay , then we have two closets . no , no , we're gonna have three closets , one for each base , no homers . yes ?

25864	4	a	you know , you're in a meeting , and nobody knows that you've had sex there , except for you and him . 
25865	2	a	 ew . 
25866	0	a	whoa . 
25867	0	a	 we should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make darryl mad . 
25868	0	a	i think he can hear us . 
25869	0	a	 that makes sense , 'cause i feel like i'd be able to hear us at this level . 
25870	0	a	darryl is a jerk . 
25871	0	a	no , i'm just testing if he can hear . 
25872	0	a	oh . okay .

25878	3	a	since when is comfort the most important thing ? i mean , i don't . . . i don't sit on your lap because it's comfortable . i sit on your lap because i like the way your thighs feel on my butt . 
25879	3	a	oh . okay . well , if it makes you uncomfortable , then we'll stop . 
25880	3	a	holly and i are like romeo and juliet . and this office is like the dragon that kept them apart . 
25881	3	a	hey , you know why people here are complaining ? they are jealous of two people in love on valentine's day . 
25882	3	a	i love you . 
25883	3	a	i love you-love you . 
25884	3	a	i am really disappointed in the office's policy on pda at this moment . i love you . 
25885	3	a	yeah , whatever . no big deal . just the hottest girl in the world loves me . 
25886	0	a	okay , ryan's the temp . what does he do at night ? 
25887	0	a	oh , or maybe not . 
25888	0	a	how romantic is this ? 
25889	0	a	right . do you see a clue or . . . 
25890	0	a	oh , my gosh .

25900	4	a	let me make something clear . jim and i have never and will never have sex in the office . 
25901	2	a	no , because the office isn't what i'd consider a romantic place . 
25902	4	a	besides , we have something those other people don't have , which is a home and a bed . 
25903	2	a	and a shower . 
25904	3	a	hello , holly .

25913	3	a	never . 
25914	3	a	i did say i would , but i was wrong . i can't stop . you don't what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back . it is a feeling that cannot and will not , and frankly , cannot be contained . 
25915	3	a	yes , it was that . it's that one . 
25916	3	a	we're not supposed to pda . 
25917	3	a	i haven't thought about you having to go back to nashua .

25965	1	a	my perfect valentine's day ? i'm at home , three cell phones in front of me , fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations i made over six months ago . 
25966	3	a	what are our plans for tonight ? umm . . . 
25967	3	a	after three years of writing , one year of shooting , four years of re-shooting and two years of editing , i have finally completed my movie , threat level: midnight . 
25968	3	a	erin . . . what are you doing ? 
25969	3	a	that's . . . that's . well , don't put words in my mouth . 
25970	2	a	threat level: midnight is the great lost film of michael scott . 
25971	4	a	we're all in it , from like years and years ago . it's like a home movie . 
25972	2	a	yeah , if michael scott did your home movie ! 
25973	4	a	michael screened a work in progress for us , years ago , and it didn't go well . we thought it was a comedy . everything pointed to it being a comedy . 
25974	4	a	we'd love to see it ! 
25975	3	a	sweet , i will go invite holly . 
25976	4	a	okay everyone , i know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in , but we have to remember that michael is sensitive , so let's stay positive ! and no laughing , no comments , just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day ! okay ? 
25977	3	a	mhmm ! it's got action , it's got heart , it's got some bosom . 
25978	3	a	it's got a lot of me . 
25979	3	a	ladies and gentleman , threat level: midnight . 
25980	1	a	i play samuel , michael scarn's robot butler . i wanted samuel's voice- to be like this ! but michael thought that samuel should be a very advance android , almost indistinguishable from a real person . 
25981	3	a	dwight does not play a robot . 
25982	2	a	i did not love the dialogue . or the character . i took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless . 
25983	1	a	he cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned ! what was the point of spilling the drink on me ? 
25984	3	a	by far and away , the most expensive shot in the movie . but , it was integral to the story . 
25985	3	a	that was not scripted . 
25986	2	a	 sorry . 
25987	2	a	i'm sorry , i'm really , really sorry . i think i was just relieved , to see that michael scarn got his confidence back . 
25988	3	a	 well that's a . . . pretty good reaction . pretty cool , right ? did you like it ? did you like that ? 
25989	3	a	okay . no , it's not good enough . it's not good enough . . . 
25990	0	a	some people are really popping on screen ! 
25991	3	a	hey . 
25992	3	a	mmmm , good ? everybody out there says it's great ! 
25993	3	a	did you ? what did you love about it ? 
25994	3	a	no , no . holly , this isn't ocean's eleven , where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out . what'd you really think , honestly . 
25995	3	a	is it , is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me ? see , because i need you . . . to keep me grounded . 
25996	3	a	 it was eleven years , okay ? this has been my dream for eleven years , and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream . 
25997	3	a	i talk about a lot of things , holly ! i was eventually gonna get around to my dream ! obviously ! eleven years i could've been working on the scarn nebulus . 
25998	3	a	because , if i don't have this , what do i have ? i have nothing . 
25999	3	a	i have my book on business , somehow i manage . i have my hbo comedy special , here i go again dot-dot-dot . but you know what ? when i think about it , when i really think about it , none of those things are as real to me as my movie . 
26000	3	a	yeah , you're a real pain in the ass . and i'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great ! and i'm sorry i called you a pain in the ass , i'm angry , and i love you . 
26001	3	a	who likes threat level: midnight ? okay then who wants to watch the rest ? ! 
26002	3	a	we filmed this during an actual scranton high school hockey game , trying to qualify for states . 
26003	2	a	 that's fine , it's great ! 
26004	3	a	no , no ! actually it's really screwed up because they , they were trying to qualify , they were disqualified , they had to forfeit the game . undefeated season . that's why there were so many people there . 
26005	3	a	hey . . . 
26006	3	a	no it's not . it's not . but , they really seem to be enjoying it . 
26007	3	a	oh yeah , i guess i did let him be a robot . 
26008	0	a	 whoa whoa whoa ! isn't the president evil ? 
26009	3	a	oh yeah ! yes he is ! 
26010	1	a	no no , he's doing it to catch the president ! 
26011	3	a	no , no dwight . he's just being stupid . 
26012	1	a	i have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern pennsylvania . but everything has a shelf-life . so i must eat and replace everything that's about to expire . it's nice not to have to plan my meals . 
26013	1	a	they're still good for another week . 
26014	2	a	because of the sign , that says no pounding no begging . 
26015	1	a	no . because you laughed at me . kevin will be eaten ! pam will be taken slave ! jim will be made a warlord's gesture . meredith will do ok . be assured this day will come . it's just a matter of time . could be one month , could be two months . 
26016	2	a	three months . 
26017	1	a	could be . 
26018	2	a	four months . 
26019	1	a	i can see that happening , yes . 
26020	2	a	eight months ? 
26021	1	a	that's a realistic time line . 
26022	2	a	 eleven months . 
26023	1	a	perhaps . 
26024	2	a	okay now really think hard about this one: one year . 
26025	1	a	i can see that as a very real possibility . 
26026	2	a	 four hundred and ninety-four months ? 
26027	1	a	i can see that happening . 
26028	2	a	four hundred and ninety-five months . that's just . . . 
26029	3	a	still not seeing the problem here . 
26030	3	a	it was the best of times , it was the awesomest of times . and now packer wants to come home . and ohh , look who's here to sign off on it ! my boo , holly . 
26031	3	a	hi . 
26032	3	a	oh , michael ! this'll be just us . 
26033	3	a	oh , yes yes yes yes . just so you know , he's at his funniest when you've given him five shots . 
26034	3	a	and it also helps if you've had five shots . 
26035	3	a	whoa ! 
26036	2	a	 why is packer back ? 
26037	3	a	is packer here ? 
26038	1	a	why's he talking to holly ? 
26039	3	a	 don't know , don't care . 
26040	2	a	what ! ? 
26041	3	a	you did ! you got burned , because packer's back ! packer is turning in his car for a desk . he is turning in his condoms , for a condominium ! although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out . 
26042	1	a	 holly , you approved this ? 
26043	2	a	you did approve it ? 
26044	4	a	i got erin a new computer , because the one at reception sucked . i should know . and i don't wanna say the other one was old , but its i . p . number is one ! right ? 
26045	4	a	awwh , you're welcome . my pleasure . 
26046	2	a	 can i do something for ya ? 
26047	4	a	i just helped someone out . it feels good . 
26048	2	a	nice . you know , i cleaned our daughter for like , an hour at four a . m . this morning , so . . . 
26049	4	a	so you know the feeling . 
26050	3	a	special delivery for dwight k . schrute . 
26051	1	a	i didn't order anything . 
26052	3	a	and i don't have anything for you . but i do wanna talk to you about something . we have been thinking about where packer should sit . . . and we can't just sit around and wait for creed to die . 
26053	1	a	well there's a lot of seats in the annex . 
26054	3	a	so you wouldn't mind permanently relocating , so that packer can take this desk here . 
26055	1	a	i have been sitting here for ten years , michael . 
26056	1	a	no it is not . 
26057	3	a	 let's look at this . 
26058	1	a	i don't wanna move desks ! 
26059	3	a	don't be a baby ! okay ! there it is . packer was here and so was your mom ! [todd starts humping dwight and michael who are still under the desk . 
26060	2	a	do i have any say in this ? ! 
26061	3	a	no ! 
26062	1	a	 hey , who's dirt box is this ? 
26063	1	a	what do you grow in here , bullcrap ? 
26064	4	a	 hey , um . . . 
26065	2	a	whoa , pull it back . uhm , why did you hire todd packer ? 
26066	4	a	he's seriously awful ! 
26067	2	a	 why are you nodding ? 
26068	4	a	united front . . . 
26069	2	a	well , i mean he humped michael . 
26070	0	a	where did you get this ? ! 
26071	0	a	this is a sick computer ! gwen stefani has this computer ! uhhh , pamela ! what does a guy have to do to get , ahem , one of them ? 
26072	4	a	you have a computer andy . 
26073	0	a	yeah , but if you donated my computer to africa , it would become world famous as the slowest computer in africa . so . . . 
26074	4	a	ok , but listen . we just don't have the budget for it . okay ? reception needed a computer so we got one . 
26075	0	a	well andy's desk needs a computer . and , i mean , it's just kinda a coincidence that i work there , but . . . 
26076	4	a	yes , but reception is a one person department . if i get you a new computer i have to get one for everyone in sales . for dwight , for stanley , it would be crazy . 
26077	0	a	i'm not asking for one , i need it . 
26078	0	a	phyllis , no body is handing anything out . 
26079	4	a	see , this is what i'm talking about . 
26080	0	a	what are you gonna play mange on faster ? 
26081	4	a	sorry andy . 
26082	1	a	kevin , in sumo culture , you'd be considered a promising up and comer . 
26083	4	a	 what the heck ! why do you have erin's computer ! 
26084	0	a	it's crazy , right ? erin just wanted me to have it , so we switched . 
26085	4	a	what ? erin is that true ? 
26086	4	a	erin , it's not up to you . this computer was for reception ! okay ? it's not yours to give away . 
26087	0	a	pam , when i'm freaking out , i just sorta step back and-
26088	4	a	i'm not freaking out , andy . 
26089	0	a	-take a few breaths , and then i ask myself: is this worth freaking out about ? 
26090	4	a	andy , why should she have your crappy computer ? 
26091	0	a	that's interesting . so you also think my computer is crappy . 
26092	4	a	switch the computers back andy . 
26093	0	a	seriously ? 
26094	4	a	seriously . 
26095	0	a	pam ! come on !

26100	3	a	please . 
26101	3	a	yeah , you love him right ? you love him . i can tell . 
26102	3	a	no . not me , him . 
26103	3	a	whoa ! look , are you jealous of him ? because you think he's funnier than you ? oh honey . . . 
26104	3	a	he's funnier than me . 
26105	3	a	so i'm less funny than not funny at all ? 
26106	3	a	 uhm . . . 
26107	3	a	that's insane ! 
26108	2	a	yeah . 
26109	1	a	 hey packer , i made you some hot chocolate . 
26110	1	a	cause i wanna let bygones be bygones . show you i'm cool . you're the new guy . it's cold out . i made too much . i got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife . 
26111	2	a	that's a lot of reasons ! 
26112	1	a	drink it ! 
26113	2	a	 can i talk to you a second ? 
26114	2	a	so , this hot chocolate thing . 
26115	1	a	none of your business . 
26116	2	a	well , you know you can't actually poison him . 
26117	1	a	it wasn't poison jim , it was a laxative . people take laxatives all the time . this is just , a lot more of a laxative . let me handle this . 
26118	2	a	i really think we should join forces on this one . 
26119	1	a	really . 
26120	2	a	what do we think , what would drive him crazy . 
26121	1	a	i know . 
26122	2	a	here we go . 
26123	1	a	pepto-bismol , in his hot chocolate . 
26124	2	a	you've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff . i was thinking we can jam his drawers , so they only comes out two inches , then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them . 
26125	1	a	 ooh does edgar allan poe know about that one ? so sinister ! that wouldn't annoy a person at all ! where do you come up with this stuff ? 
26126	2	a	okay ! well this isn't my best , but call froggy101 , say that we're the tour manager for justin bieber , and we're giving away free tickets , we give him a number to call for the tickets , and it's his own number . 
26127	1	a	who is justice beaver ? 
26128	2	a	he . . . it's a crime fighting beaver . 
26129	1	a	why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me . can you do that ? 
26130	2	a	absolutely , i'll e-mail you a hundred . 
26131	1	a	yeah , write up your list of one hundred , edit it down to your top forty , then e-mail it to me , and i'll read it over . 
26132	0	a	pam . can i talk to you in private ? 
26133	4	a	i don't know if there's really a private place in this office . 
26134	0	a	well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and i signed us up for three mods . a mod is five minutes . and it started two minutes ago . 
26135	4	a	 you did that ? 
26136	0	a	can we talk about this in the meeting ? because we're a little late . 
26137	4	a	okay . when did people sign-
26138	0	a	mind if i close the door ? what you did out there , earlier , was totally un-cool . 
26139	4	a	well what was i supposed to do , let you walk all over me ? 
26140	0	a	you humiliated me in front of every body ! 
26141	4	a	okay , well i didn't think about it like that . it's just , i can't do anything about it . i can't replace that one unless that computer breaks . 
26142	0	a	i mean , it's pretty broken already . 
26143	4	a	yeah , well if it breaks all the way i can get you a new one . 
26144	0	a	 pretty sneaky sis . 
26145	1	a	 there are over four hundred of these ! 
26146	2	a	yeah i couldn't cut it down . 
26147	1	a	they're all good . so good ! number three: eat a frog . that sounds promising . number four: eat a dog . i don't know , um , from practical stand point-
26148	2	a	one thirty-five . did you like one thirty-five ? 
26149	1	a	eat a brog . maybe it's because i didn't understand it . i just had a couple of notes , let me grab a pen . damn it . gah ! just when we were getting going . 
26150	3	a	and you made hank smile , that doesn't happen often . you're very charming . that is something you should take upstairs , and use on people that really matter . 
26151	3	a	i don't know , holly mentioned that there were some complaints . and that you had said some things about kevin . 
26152	3	a	yeah . 
26153	3	a	i guess you said something weird about your daughter ? 
26154	3	a	you've been on the road a long time . and you've been an outdoor cat . and now you have to be an indoor cat , so you can't be peeing all over the walls . 
26155	3	a	no it isn't . 
26156	3	a	yeah , a little bit . 
26157	3	a	i won't . 
26158	3	a	 okay , every body . i need you to see this . because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated , who will surprise you . todd packer , is going to apologize . kevin ! front and center , come here . 
26159	3	a	kevin , we know that you are just trying to save face , we know that you are hurt and embarrassed . 
26160	3	a	okay , sweetie , no . you shouldn't be apologizing to packer . that doesn't make any sense . you ready for this ? you ready for this ? gentlemen , start your engines . 
26161	3	a	kevin , do you accept the apology ? 
26162	3	a	okay , go back to the annex . 
26163	3	a	that-that was maybe too much . packer is a survivor of divorce stanley . packer doesn't speak with his child , meredith . packer never lived up to his parent's expectations , andy . angela loves pussy cats , and packer loves-
26164	3	a	i was going to say dogs ! okay , you know what , this is over ! apology has been issued ! and we're through with it . packer will be here until the day he dies , just like the rest of us ! 
26165	4	a	 so listen , we have to really scuff this up . 
26166	0	a	no no no no no ! we can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak . or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit , but they died and they never came , i think i'm gonna make myself cry . 
26167	4	a	andy , this is the deal we made . 
26168	0	a	 that's probably good . that's enough . 
26169	4	a	we should break this hinge maybe . 
26170	0	a	let's not go crazy . 
26171	2	a	 absolutely , now when you get down there , jo's a little bit , uh , forgetful . so she may have locked the gate , but what you're gonna do is go ahead , hop it , and just head back to the pool . 
26172	2	a	it is weird ! look at you , perceptive . now i know why jo's kept her eye on you ! 
26173	1	a	 and you make sure to get down there and check out that harry potter world . 
26174	2	a	 whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you ! 
26175	1	a	harry potter world is supposed to be faaantastic ! 
26176	1	a	check it out and have a free butterbeer on us . keep the receipt and we'll get ya' back ! 
26177	3	a	what are you doing ? 
26178	2	a	 all right , so just pack your bags and , uh , be sure to bring those swimming trunks ! bye now ! 
26179	3	a	i cannot believe this , you're sending packer to florida ? why ? 
26180	2	a	he's a jerk . 
26181	1	a	he took my desk . 
26182	3	a	okay , so you're tricking him into flying to florida ? 
26183	1	a	it wasn't my first choice , jim had so many better ideas . 
26184	3	a	you have to tell him . you have to tell him what you did . 
26185	1	a	no , no , no . that is not part of the plan . that is actually anti-what we're doing . 
26186	3	a	he is my oldest friend , i am going to tell him . 
26187	2	a	wait ! why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about ? 
26188	0	a	 pam , how is this thing even any better than my old computer ? 
26189	4	a	come on andy ! i mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best i could do ! 
26190	0	a	where'd you even find this thing , like , in the corner in the warehouse ?

26273	4	a	michael , you've had two ideas today . and one of them was great . and the other one was terrible . 
26274	3	a	i am not in the mood for riddles pam . 
26275	4	a	this is terrible . 
26276	3	a	no , this is romantic . 
26277	4	a	you know what ? i'm gonna get a hose . then we'll talk about it . ok we'll figure it out . be right back . just stay there . 
26278	1	a	you got this kosher certified ? 
26279	1	a	ryan , you have such an interesting mind . so creative . all these new business ideas and artistic projects . 
26280	1	a	oh , its just stanley's old photo album . i'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage . i mean , why would i want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf . i'm not james franco . 
26281	1	a	things are going very well . i traded a thumb tack for meredith's junk for kelly's crap for phyllis' garbage for oscars trash for stanley's garbage for ryan's junk for creed's garbage for a very cute squid that erin happened to have . 
26282	1	a	jim , put those away . 
26283	2	a	 i'm really sorry . pam must have put those out . 
26284	1	a	just out of curiosity , what were the claims for those beans ? 
26285	2	a	they're legumes dwight , and you're just gonna make fun of me , so why would i . . . you know what , this ends now . 
26286	4	a	hey michael everyone's in the conference room . 
26287	3	a	why ? 
26288	4	a	you called the meeting i don't . . 
26289	3	a	i did ? 
26290	3	a	ok . thank you all for coming . i would like to talk to you all today about . . . recycling . 
26291	4	a	michael . 
26292	3	a	yes . 
26293	4	a	we are a family . 
26294	3	a	i could not have agreed with you more . 
26295	4	a	and i've always believed that we should all be involved in everyone's personal lives , in a very major way . 
26296	3	a	yes . thank you . 
26297	4	a	so about this proposal thing . . . 
26298	3	a	no , no , no , no . my minds made up i am not going to change my mind you can't talk me out of it . 
26299	4	a	michael , she's perfect for you . 
26300	2	a	she's amazing . this is very exciting . 
26301	4	a	so we just . . . we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable . 
26302	3	a	i had a great idea until you ruined it . 
26303	0	a	 hmm , i'm gonna play me a little ol' black mail card . 
26304	0	a	and call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all . 
26305	0	a	why not . seems to me we're just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being . 
26306	0	a	oooh . 
26307	0	a	well played . 
26308	0	a	we must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot . 
26309	0	a	well that's dallas . 
26310	4	a	ok i think animals and proposals are out . right ryan didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out ? 
26311	3	a	how about this i throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof , it hits the ground , the head pops off , this leads me to the line ' i lost my head when i fell in love with you . '
26312	2	a	that's a guarantee . 
26313	3	a	it's easy enough to get a corpse , you just go to a med school . i already have the ring . 
26314	2	a	don't think you need the corpse then . 
26315	3	a	heres the ring . 
26316	4	a	holy s*** is that real ? 
26317	3	a	yeah . i saved 3 years salary . 
26318	3	a	is she not going to like that ? 
26319	4	a	no she's going to love it so i think you can keep the proposal simple . you know like when jim proposed . he just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect . 
26320	2	a	at a gas station . 
26321	3	a	at a gas station ? 
26322	2	a	oh it was when she was working in new york so it was halfway between both of us . 
26323	3	a	that mush have been a surprise when . . . at the gas station you proposed . 
26324	4	a	no it was really it was really sweet . it was raining and . . 
26325	3	a	oh yea you didn't say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect . i want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever . 
26326	2	a	totally reasonable . 
26327	3	a	i just . . . it's terrifying . 
26328	4	a	she's not gonna say no . 
26329	3	a	i know but i'm still scared i don't know why . 
26330	2	a	cause it's a big deal . i mean . . i knew pam was gonna say yes but i was still scared . 
26331	4	a	you were scared ? 
26332	2	a	yeah . . . it . s scary . 
26333	3	a	get this . . . kevin thought i was gonna sell my bowflex for 200 dollars and i told him 'dude this was a prop in my movie . '
26334	3	a	ok it's because we haven't sold anything . you know what ? we just wait until the end of the day , people get desperate , and they're gonna pay anything . 
26335	3	a	oh ok . for how long ? 
26336	3	a	is he alright ? 
26337	3	a	you ok ? 
26338	3	a	yeah , yeah well you definitely need to do that . 
26339	3	a	ok . 
26340	3	a	no , no , shhhhut it . mhmm . oh god . nope , nope , nope . 
26341	3	a	no . i am not going to be proposed to in the break room . that is not going to be our story . mhm hm . should have burned this place down when i had the chance . 
26342	0	a	you cant go , you're dead , i shot you 5 moves ago . 
26343	2	a	not bad right . 
26344	2	a	 nice . 
26345	1	a	i know right . . . what the ? 
26346	2	a	oh my god . 
26347	1	a	that . . . that's impossible . 
26348	2	a	it is right . i mean , it's impossible . 
26349	1	a	all right , i'll take them . 
26350	2	a	they're probably worthless . 
26351	1	a	probably . 
26352	2	a	leave the telescope . 
26353	1	a	i started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope . but in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all . no , it was this . . . packet of beans . so i traded the telescope for it . and i can just go buy another telescope . 
26354	3	a	hey , how'd we do ? 
26355	3	a	that's great and we still have most of our stuff . good . 
26356	3	a	no , no , no , no , lets not talk about that . 
26357	3	a	shhhh . let's go on a little walk . you know what ? i wanna show you some stuff . 
26358	3	a	so this is one of my favorite places in the world . 
26359	3	a	this is where toby announced that he was going to costa rica . happiest day of my life . until the day you came to replace him . let's go in here . 
26360	3	a	this is where we first kissed .

26363	3	a	right in here . . . this is where we first co-ran our meeting . remember , obesity awareness ? 
26364	3	a	we saved a lot of lives that day . that's where you first met michael klump . 
26365	3	a	and right over there is where you found out that meredith was prostituting herself for outback steak . and i will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it , you thought it was so wrong . 
26366	3	a	and over here . . 
26367	3	a	well , nothing . nothing really . i would just find an excuse to come here so i could stare at you through that window . this is what i'd do . 
26368	3	a	let's go in here . 
26369	3	a	this is where our love faces its toughest test . after this , its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives . 
26370	2	a	holly , will you marry me ? 
26371	3	a	that guy's got more than he can handle as it is . 
26372	3	a	that marriage would be a sham . 
26373	3	a	easy no . 
26374	3	a	that would be hot . i would pay to see that . 
26375	3	a	only one that i was kind of worried about . 
26376	3	a	 this is where i fell in love with you . and this is where i ask you to marry me . it started with . . holly flax , marrying me will you be ?

26414	3	a	i happen to like the hilarious hijinx i get myself into . there he is ! deangelo , i was just telling them about last night , when we met . remember that ? that was crazy ! 
26415	3	a	oh yeah . . . i know . . . that's what i was just saying . . . that's what . . . 
26416	0	a	that exact situation is why i always carry around some of these . nametags . just in case . because sometimes you just need to i . d . yourself . 
26417	0	a	i wasn't even trying to make a joke . but i guess i've always been sorta quirky , offbeat , a little twisted . 
26418	3	a	this is jim and pam , aka jap . what started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes . 
26419	4	a	well , it wasn't an affair . 
26420	3	a	yes it was . 
26421	4	a	but , no , but we are a family .

26425	4	a	uh oh . someone started off on the right foot with the new boss !

26433	1	a	i want to be manager . i just don't understand why i wasn't even interviewed for the job . what's wrong ? i was totally qualified , you were pushing for me . 
26434	3	a	so you decided to have an orgy and not invite me ? i call the middle ! 
26435	3	a	i sorta like the old way . 
26436	3	a	i know , i know , i'm sorry , but if it's not a big deal we should just-

26449	4	a	da-das . 
26450	2	a	and what happens here is-
26451	2	a	we were . . . i think she was just trying to-
26452	3	a	you know what , everybody ? you have to be honest , here . you can't say that everything is perfect . so , you know , come up with something . 
26453	3	a	ok , you know what , i mark it urgent a , urgent b , urgent c , urgent d . urgent a is the most important , urgent d you don't even really have to worry about .

26456	0	a	i wrote the perfect joke . topical , edgy , funny . 
26457	0	a	 . . . i saw this thing on the news . democrats want electric cars . republicans don't . i'm thinking , 'how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock . 
26458	0	a	 i wasn't taking a position . it's just one of those things where- 
26459	0	a	yeah , right , i mean-

26462	3	a	deangelo's great . i love the guy . but i'm not sure he's a great fit for the office . and also , i'm not sure if i love the guy .

26538	3	a	no , no , no ! this is the performance of your life ! 
26539	2	a	why don't you just , privately , in your own head , think of it like a meeting . 
26540	3	a	jim , please no loopholes .

26551	4	a	why don't you wanna eat lunch with your boyfriend ? 
26552	4	a	don't you think it's better to tell him the truth now ? you know , rather than waste more of his time ?

26555	2	a	i think you got this . kay ? alright . feel better !

26562	3	a	 deangelo , what are you doing ? there's a live audience out there ! 
26563	3	a	no , ryan would never do it . it's too on the radar . look , look . the boss , hosts , the dundies ! it's sort of our perk ! 
26564	3	a	listen to me , you're not doing this for me , you're not doing this for you , you're not even doing this for them ! 
26565	3	a	 you're doing this for all those kids out there , eating off the louie volpies kid's menu , wondering: does it get better ? what i want you to do , is i want you to say: it's showtime . get out there . 
26566	3	a	say it . 
26567	3	a	you can do it , just say it . 
26568	3	a	now hit me . one , two , three . 
26569	3	a	alright , here we go . 
26570	3	a	okay ! okay ! sorry about the delay everybody ! but we were at the dmv waiting in line . 
26571	2	a	nope , go back to the script . 
26572	3	a	there are a lot of great salesmen in this office , but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad . and a close personal friend of mine , jim halpert ! best dad dundie ! 
26573	2	a	wow ! i do not parent for the award but i gotta tell you it feels pretty good . uh , cece , if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime , by the way how'd this get televised ? 
26574	3	a	well done . 
26575	2	a	i don't know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass . i don't know , i don't know . thank you ! 
26576	3	a	alright . 
26577	4	a	you didn't think to mention me huh ? 
26578	2	a	didn't i ? 
26579	3	a	which moves us to , best mom dundie . i guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office . meredith palmer ! 
26580	1	a	excuse me , can i get a photo of the best mom and the best dad please ? 
26581	2	a	i gotta go do this . 
26582	4	a	 why ? 
26583	1	a	big smiles folks ! there they are . 
26584	3	a	year after year , i catch a lot of flak on this particular award , because year after year i present this award to a guy instead of a girl . hottest in the office goes to , danny cordray ! danny couldn't be here tonight . . . 
26585	3	a	stanley hudson is a grump , everybody knows that . but did you know , that stanley hudson is also the face of a debilitating disease known as diabetes . the diabetes award goes to stanley hudson ! come on up here you sick bastard . 
26586	3	a	you know , herpes affects one in five sexually active adults ? pippy longstocking , ronald mcdonald's wife , ron howard , ron weasley , what do thay all have in common ? red heads . erin hannon , come on up here and receive your cutest red head in the office award ! 
26587	3	a	 there you go . 
26588	3	a	it is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you . but he is a good guy , so the michael scott award for best dundies host goes to deangelo vickers . 
26589	3	a	 deangelo is expressing himself . [manager pulls the microphone cable , everyone can still here deangelo . 
26590	3	a	okay , we're done ! that's it . 
26591	3	a	we're done . we're done ! 
26592	3	a	 so that is how it ends . my last dundies ever . i was hoping it'd be more like godfather three . that rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way . but instead it is like godfather one ! that was , very confusing , had maybe three big laughs . oh well . . . 
26593	4	a	michael , we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going ! 
26594	3	a	what ? 
26595	3	a	no , no . you're being too hard on yourself . we had a very truncated rehearsal time . 
26596	4	a	let's grab some ice cream , go back to the office , and finish what we started . 
26597	3	a	so what you're saying is you kinda like it ? i've fallen and i can't get up ! that phyllis bit , that was pretty good . 
26598	2	a	i don't know that we need to dissect it all now , but-
26599	3	a	that got a big laugh . 
26600	2	a	that did . pretty huge laugh . 
26601	3	a	 you were laughing right ? 
26602	3	a	we're really close . 
26603	1	a	we should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room ? 
26604	3	a	that's true , we wouldn't get seats together . 
26605	3	a	 you know , despite a couple hiccups , i think that went very well . 
26606	1	a	i thought it was the worst dundies i've ever been to . 
26607	3	a	man ! maybe you should have won the kind of a bitch award . 
26608	1	a	gladly ! i'd accept that award , because a bitch , is a female dog ! 
26609	3	a	what is your problem ? ! 
26610	1	a	i just don't see a point in the dundies ! okay ? the jokes are terrible , the venue is bad , the fashion is boring . 
26611	3	a	okay ! that , that is unfair ! the clothing was safe , but tasteful . 
26612	1	a	and next time , why don't you pick a co-host , that doesn't have microphone-a-phobia ! 
26613	3	a	he is in an all-out sprint . 
26614	3	a	 here . . . okay ! by his own omission , this person actually tried marijuana in college , so the doobie doobie pothead stoner of the year award goes to , andy bernard ! 
26615	0	a	a lot of people i'd like to thank , but i think we all actually wanna thank you michael . 
26616	3	a	oh , okay . 
26617	0	a	i mean , we actually all really wanna thank you , for everything . 
26618	3	a	oh my god , something's happening . 
26619	0	a	 nine million , nine hundred eighty six thousand minutes ! we actually sat down , and did the math . 
26620	4	a	in costumes ! 
26621	2	a	and impressions ! 
26622	3	a	 yeah , okay . well this is gonna hurt like a mother .

26631	1	a	colorado specialty , rocky mountain oysters . 
26632	3	a	 oh , these do not taste like oysters .

26634	3	a	sick freak ! what is wrong with you ? 
26635	1	a	what is wrong with you ? i'm the sick freak ? after what you did ? you expect to be buttled ? you didn't recommend me ? !

26637	1	a	where did you hear that ? obvious xm radio ? 
26638	3	a	well , i was just thinking that maybe i should keep a salami in my pocket . . . 
26639	1	a	great idea . 
26640	3	a	 . . . in order to feed the bears . 
26641	1	a	especially if you think that life would be better without legs ! 
26642	3	a	how do you mean ? 
26643	3	a	okay , so no salami in the pants . how about a pepperoni ? 
26644	1	a	any kind of meat that you can possibly name !

26808	4	a	hey , well , good morning . i think i have good news for you today . i found your new executive assistant . my friend carla . she's got great experience . we even considered making her cece's godmother , but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but here's her resume . 
26809	4	a	okay . 
26810	2	a	hey ! 
26811	0	a	hey ! 
26812	4	a	oh my god , he hates me ! 
26813	2	a	no he doesn't . you just get so nervous and hyper around him . 
26814	4	a	i know . 
26815	2	a	every time there's a silence , your brain's like 'heh-heh-huh-huh' . 
26816	4	a	is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings ? 
26817	2	a	careful . there is no inner circle . 
26818	0	a	oh , there's an inner circle . oh yeah . 
26819	2	a	there is no inner circle . deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things , to a few guys . 
26820	1	a	oh , wow , thank you . that was so kind of you . 
26821	1	a	it's just that i own the coffee shop . so , once you've seen sausage being made , all you want to do is make sausage , because it's so much fun . 
26822	1	a	i think you'll find what you're looking for over there . 
26823	2	a	that's toys r us , i think . 
26824	1	a	congratulations on your one cousin . i have seventy . each one better than the last . 
26825	1	a	i'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here . okay ? i do my job well , so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it . okay ? 
26826	1	a	what ? 
26827	1	a	no you're not . 
26828	1	a	no . 
26829	1	a	no . 
26830	1	a	no . 
26831	1	a	no . 
26832	1	a	no . 
26833	1	a	no . 
26834	2	a	 uh oh , this former administrative assistant misspelled 'administrative' and 'assistant . '
26835	2	a	seriously ? 
26836	4	a	oh no , do you think it was stolen ? 
26837	0	a	i gotcha covered , boss . used to play with the parabolas myself . got some extra balls ! hey-hey-hey-ho ! 
26838	4	a	oh wow , you weren't kidding . 
26839	4	a	 look . i'm juggling eggs and bowling balls . i'm juggling with one hand . no hands . 
26840	2	a	what could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine ? 
26841	4	a	what could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine ? how can you keep defending him ? 
26842	2	a	he's good at his job . and i like working for him . 
26843	0	a	whoa , whoa , whoa . i think if he was sexist , i'd be able to tell . i took a crapload of women's studies courses at cornell . and i wrote my own companion piece to the 'vagina monologues' called the 'penis apologies . ' so i know a thing or two . 
26844	0	a	how could i not see it ? you're so right . 
26845	4	a	 why don't you talk to him about it ? 
26846	2	a	and say what ? 'hey deangelo , are you shy or just a sexist ? '
26847	4	a	why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office ? 
26848	2	a	mmm-hmm . 
26849	0	a	and if he doesn't listen , then he can kiss his penis goodbye . snip snip . am i right , girls ? 
26850	2	a	hey , you got a second ? 
26851	2	a	umm , really , it's nothing , i was just talking to angela , and she was --
26852	2	a	if it's alright , can i just have like one minute alone , just to go over --
26853	2	a	i know . just the guys . well , maybe that's , uh , part of the problem . i think . . . so what happened was , i was talking with some of the department heads . uh , some of the female department heads . 
26854	2	a	maybe there's a vibe out there , with certain members of the office , that you are . . . a little sexist , or --
26855	2	a	whoa . whoa . wait . 
26856	2	a	oh . like nobody . 
26857	2	a	it was --
26858	2	a	that's awesome . 
26859	2	a	hey , who'd you end up hiring ? 
26860	1	a	what's the argument here ? nba , wnba . one is a sport , one is a joke . i love sports , i love jokes . room for all . 
26861	4	a	so , jordan , uh , where did you work before ? uh , a law office ? 
26862	4	a	so , umm , is this your first office job then ? 
26863	4	a	wow . 
26864	2	a	oh yeah , did he text us ? 
26865	1	a	 no ! 
26866	4	a	jim , what are you doing ? get in there . this is not the time to take a stand . at least he likes one of us . 
26867	2	a	he didn't text me . 
26868	0	a	yes ! i'm in . 
26869	0	a	i'm going in , into the belly of the beast . gonna infiltrate and change from within . what's up , mancave ! 
26870	4	a	 just go in . just go in , he probably forgot to text you . 
26871	2	a	 don't worry , the first day's always the hardest . 
26872	2	a	yeah . 
26873	2	a	nope . just . . . okay . 
26874	1	a	so , he kicked you out of the inner circle , huh ? 
26875	2	a	well , there is no inner . . . circle . 
26876	1	a	really ? anything . 
26877	1	a	deangelo , tell your whore to leave me alone . 
26878	2	a	so this is my life . until i win the lottery . or pam finally writes that series of young adult books . 
26879	4	a	so one afternoon , while walking home from school , quirky 10th grader becky walters finds a wounded pegasus in the woods . and she becomes . . . the horse flyer . 
26880	4	a	 hey ! it sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun , but it's really loud , and some of us are trying to work , so do you think you could do it a little more quietly ? 
26881	4	a	okay , well it's just really loud . 
26882	4	a	you're back in . 
26883	2	a	you know what ? instead of a game , why don't we do an exhibition ? i'd love to see that dunk of yours . 
26884	2	a	today . now , maybe . 'cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball , so you don't have to mime it . 
26885	2	a	why not ? 
26886	1	a	pass . if i wanted to see a pissing contest , i'd lock mose in the chicken coop . 
26887	1	a	okay , a little about me . i respond to strong leadership . 
26888	2	a	alright , there you go . 
26889	2	a	15 feet from the baseline , so , you need me to move it in ? 
26890	2	a	okay . 
26891	2	a	fantastic . 
26892	2	a	yup . 
26893	2	a	 now what ? 
26894	2	a	oh my god , are you alright ? erin , will you call 911 please ? 
26895	2	a	erin . 
26896	4	a	we could get deangelo flowers . 
26897	1	a	no , you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma . they'll wilt before he wakes up . 
26898	2	a	all in favor of the baskets full of chocolates , teddy bears , and balloons ? 
26899	1	a	wait , wait . all in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods , chainsaw , gasoline , and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse ? 
26900	2	a	nope . baskets have it . 
26901	2	a	 well , i really appreciate the offer , but i'm just happy the way things are . okay . thank you . that was jo , asking me if i wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement . i told her . . . i don't want to mess this up , right ? there's a consensus , people are happy . 
26902	1	a	 dwight schrute . yes , i would . thank you . jordan , gather my things from my desk . 
26903	2	a	wait . . . 
26904	4	a	what have you done ? 
26905	1	a	mose . . . you'll never guess where i am right now . 
26906	4	a	can't stay there all day . 
26907	2	a	i'm coming . 
26908	4	a	do i at least get to go with you in this fantasy ? 
26909	2	a	you'd slow me down . 
26910	4	a	stop stalling ! come on . 
26911	1	a	excellent . morning announcements ! there's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes . your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you , and you only , okay ? don't share it . jo bennett , our ceo , will be here today for a high-level meeting involving gabe and myself . 
26912	1	a	that's on a need-to-know basis . 
26913	1	a	 general meet-and-greet . so i expect you to be on your best behavior , which means none of you will be insubordinate , nor will you foment insurrection . 
26914	2	a	question , if we already fomented insurrection , may we be grandfathered in ? 
26915	1	a	define foment . 
26916	2	a	you define foment . 
26917	1	a	 please take note of the new color-coding system . 
26918	1	a	 aha ! 
26919	1	a	gotcha ! why are you late ? 
26920	1	a	all right . you stop me when i reach the diseased area . 
26921	0	a	in fairness , darryl did tell me that joke , so . . . 
26922	0	a	i know , right ? 
26923	0	a	yeah ? 
26924	0	a	sure . what's going on ? 
26925	0	a	what ? 
26926	0	a	no , this is horrifying . 
26927	0	a	we're just friends , okay ? 
26928	0	a	yeah , fine , i promise . we'll never date again . can we go outside now ? 
26929	1	a	 hey , hey , hey , hey . what do you think you're doing ? what's this ? what's the fist ? 
26930	2	a	oh , it's just a social club . you know , like the french revolution , or the black panthers , or communism . it's just a club . guys talking , you know . 
26931	1	a	you expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion ? 
26932	2	a	nope . social club . god , i hate when everybody calls us a rebellion . 
26933	1	a	okay , you know what ? i would love to join the fist . 
26934	2	a	and we would love to have you . but not today . unfortunately , it's a bad day , what with operation overthrow and everything , but i have noted it . 
26935	0	a	pam , i have to show you this video . you're gonna love it . it's beyonce falling with a fart mixed in . 
26936	1	a	i will never be happier than i am right now . i will also never be less happy . i will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life . because i am manager of the scranton branch of dunder mifflin . acting manager . 
26937	4	a	you mean the frozen mice for the piranha ? 
26938	2	a	wow , you've really embraced the whole bond villain aesthetic . 
26939	1	a	ah , jim , jim , jim . the gun is a beaumont-adams . jo collects them . i thought we could have some nice small talk about it . and the piranha's a rescue . 
26940	2	a	and the desk . 
26941	1	a	the desk is a replica of uday hussein's desk . i saw a picture in newsweek . listen , i'm a very busy man . let's get right down to business . 
26942	2	a	okay . 
26943	1	a	jo is coming later today . i cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid . okay ? i need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior . 
26944	2	a	i promise . . . d other people that i would be on my worst behavior . and i gave them my word , so . . . 
26945	1	a	don't make me fire you . 
26946	2	a	you can't fire me . you're acting manager . not office manager . so you have no firing powers . 
26947	1	a	don't make me pre-fire you . 
26948	2	a	you wouldn't dare . 
26949	1	a	watch this . you're pre-fired . and when i'm promoted , you'll be full fired . 
26950	2	a	 if you get promoted , and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then . 
26951	1	a	what ? 
26952	2	a	if i had thought that there was a real chance that dwight would be permanent manager , i would have pre-quit . and you might be saying to yourself , 'well that's pretty premature to think , ' but i always say , it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared . 
26953	1	a	how you doing , jordan ? 
26954	1	a	everyone here thinks that you're a joke . they think that you were hired because of your good looks , which won't last long anyway . as your pale skin and severe bone structure imply , you'll age swiftly and poorly . 
26955	1	a	now i want you to find out what people are saying about me , things they don't want me to know abou- ohh . . . it's a holster . 
26956	1	a	 yep . yep , yep , yep . lookin' good . ohh . . . oh , what a day . what a day . 
26957	4	a	dwight , are you carrying a gun ? 
26958	1	a	the holster was a gift from my great-uncle honk . um , i don't know . i guess he's saying that he's proud of me . 
26959	0	a	dwight , guns make me really uncomfortable . 
26960	1	a	the gun is just an accessory to the holster , okay ? i can't walk around wearing an empty holster . 
26961	4	a	why do you need to wear the holster at all ? 
26962	1	a	why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time ? 
26963	1	a	uh . . . hello ! 
26964	1	a	why would i put a banana in my holster ? 
26965	4	a	dwight , no gun , okay ? don't make us call jo . 
26966	1	a	okay . all right . fine . everyone calm down . someone get me a banana . sorry i freaked you guys out - aah ! 
26967	0	a	aah ! aah ! it's so loud ! 
26968	0	a	 eeeeeeee . . . there's like this crazy ringing going on . i can't - eeeeeee . . . i can't find perfect c . 
26969	1	a	no , no , no . all we know is that a gun fired . that's all we know ! no . that's not true . actually , we heard a loud noise . later , a hole was seen . no one saw the bullet leave the gun . 
26970	0	a	 something's definitely wrong . 
26971	1	a	okay , why are you calling jo ? 
26972	0	a	i think i should go the hospital . 
26973	0	a	thank you , darryl . 
26974	0	a	it's my ear . 
26975	0	a	okay , sorry . 
26976	1	a	okay , everyone ! conference room , right now ! 
26977	1	a	 yee-haw ! whoo-hoo ! howdy , partners ! it's me , gun-safety dwight ! and i'm the rootin'-est-- i can't do this . um , look . obviously , a gun went off under my watch , and i'm launching a full investigation . 
26978	1	a	really ? you did ? what hand was i holding the gun in ? what did andy's tie look like ? 
26979	1	a	i have no way of knowing if that's true . 
26980	1	a	okay , really ? 
26981	1	a	come on . 
26982	1	a	i just really , really think we should handle this internally . 
26983	0	a	hey . we're back . 
26984	1	a	there he is ! our hero ! you look fantastic . how you doing ? here , tell us your war stories . 
26985	0	a	well , i burst my eardrum . doctor said it could take weeks to heal . 
26986	1	a	did they say what caused it ? because i know you like putting q-tips deep into your ear canal . 
26987	0	a	yeah . 
26988	0	a	temporary deafness in one ear . it was both ears . i couldn't hear a thing darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room . 
26989	1	a	american idol ? what ? no . 
26990	1	a	no . 
26991	1	a	okay , fine . you can go on your singing audition . 
26992	1	a	i put everything back in the vending machine . 
26993	4	a	you have to get rid of all your weapons . all of them . including killer fish . 
26994	1	a	okay . 
26995	2	a	oh , is it my turn ? ooh , i'm on the spot . i don't know . um . . . you know what ? i think i'm good . 
26996	1	a	thank god . 
26997	2	a	nope . when jo's here , can you work in 'shagadelic , baby , ' at least three times in a conversation ? oh , and when i cough can you do jazz hands ? 
26998	1	a	what's jazz hands ? 
26999	1	a	fine . 
27000	1	a	hello , jo . welcome . well , shall we begin ? 
27001	2	a	well , i don't know about that . just wasn't for me . but let me assure you , dwight is firing on all cylinders . right ? 
27002	1	a	 well , what can you do ? life . 
27003	0	a	we have to clean this up now ! 
27004	0	a	no ! 
27005	0	a	uh . . . 
27006	0	a	did i say that earlier ? yes , i did . because you , gabe , were crying . . . 
27007	0	a	and sobbing uncontrollably . yes . uh-huh . you were in hysterics . and my maternal instincts kicked in . is it actually how i feel ? yes . or no . that is . . . between me and my diary . 
27008	1	a	oscar , can you print out last year's sale statements ? 
27009	1	a	no , kevin , come on . 
27010	1	a	kevin , not now . 
27011	1	a	okay , okay . shh ! 
27012	1	a	you're kidding me . oh god , what am i touching ? it's moist . 
27013	1	a	oh , it's so wet . 
27014	1	a	i can't . i can't push harder ! 
27015	1	a	okay , how's that ? 
27016	1	a	i'm kneading it ! 
27017	1	a	jo . . . i accidentally fired a gun in the office today . 
27018	1	a	i am telling you this because i care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly . all i've ever wanted was to be manager here . and if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident , i understand . but if you think that extortion is worse -
27019	1	a	it was a beaumont-adams , if that helps . 
27020	1	a	i take full responsibility . 
27021	1	a	pam made me put a banana in my holster . 
27022	4	a	you shot a gun off -
27023	1	a	okay . did i make a mistake ? yes . do i regret the decision that i made ? yes . 
27024	1	a	got it . 
27025	1	a	 jo , please . . . i will -
27026	2	a	yep . 
27027	2	a	hey , dwight . what's up ? 
27028	1	a	shut up . 
27029	2	a	well , you do know that jo was right to take the job away from you , right ? there's no debating that . but , i will say . . . in your one week , every single one of the orders went out on time . and i think that is shagadelic , baby . 
27030	2	a	he never called a meeting . 
27031	4	a	what are we doing ? 
27032	4	a	we need a new manager . 
27033	2	a	 your paper experience is very interesting . do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here ? 
27034	2	a	really ? 
27035	2	a	 . . . what is it ? 
27036	2	a	you could just be saying it to get the job . 
27037	2	a	how about this . why don't you give us a part of the plan , and that way we know you have it . 
27038	2	a	okay . 
27039	2	a	did you just trademark that . . . 
27040	0	a	the manager job ? nah , i'm barely interested . i just can't not go for it . you know , it's not the bernard way . we give it the old college try , and then , in defeat , we show grace . 
27041	0	a	don't even . . . eeehhhh ! ! ! ! 
27042	0	a	eeehhh ! ! no . hehe . 
27043	0	a	in my family , you don't really go out and get things . if you want something , you write it on a list , and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it , on wednesdays and fridays . so , i don't know , i guess you could say this job is on my list , and . . . we'll see what rosa comes back with . 
27044	4	a	 should you really be so blatant about that ? 
27045	1	a	they won't make me manager , and i won't settle for anything less . i've gone about as far as i can here . that's obvious . time to take my talents elsewhere . 
27046	4	a	are you really going to apply for work at scranton breadworks ? 
27047	1	a	bread is the paper of the food industry . you write your sandwich on it . 
27048	2	a	unfortunately , that range is set at corporate . 
27049	2	a	heh . we think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous . 
27050	2	a	can you . . . you are a man of great confidence . could you speak a little more to that , and , what the role of confidence . . . would be . . . in a dialogue with a subordinate ? 
27051	2	a	yes . 
27052	2	a	yes . 
27053	2	a	 he creeps me out . but , i think he might be a genius . 
27054	0	a	 good luck , darryl . 
27055	2	a	 oh . 
27056	2	a	well , for instance , how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight ? 
27057	2	a	 so i think all we need is a resume , and we'll be good right ? 
27058	2	a	yeah , it's no big deal , just something that looks like that . cool ? 
27059	1	a	what makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview ? what are you doing . . ? stop trying to figure me out . 
27060	1	a	you can't . 
27061	1	a	no , it's not . 
27062	1	a	stop trying to figure me out . do you even know anything about paper ? how it's made ? 
27063	1	a	 get out . 
27064	1	a	i'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak , passionless leadership . do you see my hat ? no ? that's because i just threw it in the ring . 
27065	2	a	can i ask why you're leaving your current job ? 
27066	2	a	is this a bad time to be doing this ? 
27067	4	a	 it's gorgeous , angela . 
27068	4	a	 oh-ho-ho ! he talked about himself in the third person ? 
27069	4	a	that's not accurate . 
27070	2	a	andy ? you all set ? 
27071	0	a	okay , guys , it's time . it's pep talk time . tell me what i need to hear . 
27072	0	a	 augh . 
27073	2	a	so , andy , what improvements would you make as office manager ? 
27074	0	a	for starters , i really think we can streamline communication around here . . . 
27075	0	a	i wasn't acc- , accusing . . . 
27076	0	a	right ! i really wasn't trying to insult any , anyone . 
27077	0	a	what ? 
27078	0	a	okay . let me think . . . are you counting car windows ? 
27079	0	a	 uh , 93 million miles . 
27080	2	a	 is it ? 
27081	0	a	yeah ! and the diameter of the sun is 870 , 000 miles , which makes it 109 times wider than the earth , and . . . 333 , 000 times heavier than the earth , . . . 
27082	0	a	 i am unhappy with the confusing and , at times , confrontational nature of that meeting . i wanted it to go better . i wanted it to go better ! ! 
27083	4	a	how is this on me ? 
27084	4	a	hang up . corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture . intel has told us there were at least seven . 
27085	4	a	they're the same picture . 
27086	2	a	your department's just you , right ? 
27087	1	a	 i want an interview . 
27088	1	a	 how's the family ?

27096	1	a	great ! oh , that's great . . . we never were very good at small talk , were we , jim ? 
27097	2	a	no . 
27098	1	a	now , listen , . . . 
27099	2	a	you're not getting an interview , dwight . the whole point of this search committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again . 
27100	1	a	okay , i know why you're saying that , jim , i really do , but think of it this way . the hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat is the strong hand you want on the wheel . 
27101	2	a	 okay . that's vivid . 
27102	1	a	i'm going to make you an offer . okay ? you even do so little as grant me an interview , i will guarantee you your dream work life . okay ? you roll in at 10 a . m . to your own private reserved parking spot , pick up your daily free coffee from dwight's caffeine corner , unlimited sex breaks for you and pam . . . 
27103	2	a	yikes . 
27104	1	a	erin will eat garbage for your entertainment . 
27105	2	a	well , you know how i like taking bribes . 
27106	1	a	ha ha ! 
27107	2	a	unfortunately , jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment . so how would that look for me , if i recommended you ? 
27108	1	a	fine . i'll do it without you , but you'll regret this . 
27109	2	a	okay . 
27110	1	a	let me get that for you . 
27111	2	a	thank you . 
27112	1	a	okay . 
27113	4	a	the senator ? he was married before , and he has a kid . 
27114	4	a	and don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids . 
27115	4	a	did you see him at a bathhouse ? 
27116	4	a	the windowless building by the baskin robbins . 
27117	4	a	forget it . i'm never gonna know what goes on there . 
27118	4	a	you're in the gay mafia . 
27119	4	a	no . 
27120	2	a	great . 
27121	2	a	i'm sure it's fine . 
27122	2	a	howard cline ? 
27123	2	a	 oh . . . deshaun williams . 
27124	2	a	he's an amazing man . he's a rhodes scholar . he invented an app that invents apps . fantastic kisser . . . 
27125	2	a	darryl ! we all know you . your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys . 
27126	2	a	that's very interesting . um , i feel like there might be a conflict there , and if a conflict did arise , how would that be dealt with ? 
27127	2	a	i think that's probably all we need to hear from . . . 
27128	2	a	that's very . . . 
27129	2	a	you know what ? they all just sort of blend together after a while . 
27130	2	a	no , not at all . in fact , i'm not even taking it seriously . i think at the end of the day , i'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat . 
27131	2	a	uh--
27132	2	a	okay , everybody , i was just making a joke . i am taking it seriously , i promise . 
27133	2	a	no , was it good ? 
27134	1	a	 jo , may i speak to you for a second ? 
27135	1	a	ha ha ha ! ha ha ha ! ohh , i enjoy laughing at my mistakes , because i've learned so much from them . i'd like to be interviewed for the position . 
27136	1	a	okay . 
27137	1	a	it's complicated . 
27138	4	a	i'm a woman . i would want to know . 
27139	4	a	she does seem happy . 
27140	4	a	okay . 
27141	4	a	uh , just put him through to me . 
27142	4	a	hello ! this is . . . the client . 
27143	4	a	yes . 
27144	4	a	great . 
27145	4	a	thank you , bye-bye . 
27146	1	a	 assistant regional manager . 
27147	2	a	assistant to the regional manager . 
27148	1	a	 assistant regional manager . 
27149	2	a	what is it ? 
27150	1	a	 assistant regional manager . 
27151	2	a	oh , that's my mistake , sorry about that . the last paper company you worked for burned to the ground ? and all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper ? that's a travesty . 
27152	1	a	uhh . wait . wait ! no . stop ! stop . jo . . . it's me . i'm dwight . 
27153	2	a	 no . no ! wait , but , i mean , you're dwight , and then . . . he's the . . . 
27154	1	a	 yeah . 
27155	2	a	 ohhhh ! 
27156	1	a	i would have dressed this way every day , legally changed my name , learned french sign language , shown up , and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen ! 
27157	1	a	yes . 
27158	2	a	this guy was good . although , he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes . seriously . every five minutes , he was like , 'just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear . '
27159	2	a	finger lakes guy is good . darryl is also very good . 
27160	2	a	um . . . why kelly ? 
27161	2	a	okay . 
27162	2	a	oh , i didn't know you knew her ? 
27163	2	a	no . 
27164	2	a	you know , she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit . 
27165	1	a	silence ? 
27166	0	a	hey , erin . 
27167	0	a	where'd you learn how to puppet like that ? 
27168	0	a	listen , i'm really flattered , but i don't think we should . 
27169	4	a	that was our dream wedding . 
27170	4	a	 i hope . . . you have a very beautiful wedding , angela . 
27171	2	a	all right . name . 
27172	1	a	dwight schrute . 
27173	2	a	thank you , mr . schnoot . we will let you know . 
27174	1	a	you have to interview me . . . 
27175	2	a	i just did . the answer to that one question told me everything i need to know . 
27176	1	a	i demand more questions ! 
27177	2	a	 all right , guys , good day , a lot of candidates . let's discuss . 
27178	1	a	okay ! if you're not going to interview me , then i'll do it . 
27179	2	a	yes . 
27180	2	a	thank you , dwight . 
27181	1	a	thank you . you'll be hearing from us shortly , mr . schrute , and i think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive . oh , come on . i'm just happy that i got this meeting . 
27182	2	a	well , that was quick . 
27183	2	a	he's not a real candidate . 
27184	2	a	you took the deal . 
27185	2	a	that's not okay . 
27186	2	a	what is happening right now ? 
27187	2	a	no , why would you think that ? 
27188	2	a	okay . okay , guys , just so you all know , no decision has been made , and dwight is definitely not the boss . 
27189	2	a	no , no , no . not ever , 'cause that's not gonna happen . 
27190	1	a	well , it's not entirely up to you , is it ? seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad . 
27191	2	a	am i the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge ? i feel like i'm going a little bit crazy . 
27192	0	a	tuna . . . you're completely sane . 
27193	2	a	thank you . 
27194	0	a	who do you like for the job ? is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first , but now seems like a safe , if not slightly unexciting , choice ? 
27195	2	a	okay , seems like everybody has an opinion . so , who else ? anybody ? 
27196	2	a	 i suppose i am . 
27197	2	a	yes . 
27198	2	a	okay . 
27199	1	a	what a surprise ! minorities sticking together . 
27200	0	a	whoever it is , i think they should be lame . kind a a non-threatening , moderate personality . 
27201	2	a	perfect . there are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
27202	4	a	a homeless person . really ? a homeless person . 
27203	4	a	no , i want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person . 
27204	2	a	hey ! hey ! hey ! 
27205	0	a	she may have a point there . . . would a small penis work ? small-to-moderate . 
27206	4	a	ohh , hey gabe , i'm sorry , we . . . we didn't get you a cake or anything . we're gonna miss you . 
27207	1	a	we're gonna miss you , gabe . 
27208	0	a	 uh , listen up . listen up , ladies . i want the job . there , i said it . i'm educated . i'm capable . i like all of you . . . and i won't make any changes . 
27209	2	a	what about darryl ? we can all agree that he's a stand-up guy , right ? 
27210	2	a	what ? no , no , it's not a vote . 
27211	2	a	i don't know . this conversation really got away from me . 
27212	0	a	sometimes you hear about people failing upwards . i think i'm about to do that . 
27213	1	a	i will run this branch , or i will destroy this branch , or . . . i don't know . something always works out . 
27214	4	a	 is that right ? 
27215	4	a	well , okay ! 
27216	4	a	 hello ! 
27217	4	a	 hello ! 
27218	4	a	hi , how are ya ? 
27219	4	a	ohho ! i'm good ! don't you just love paper , and things about paper ! 
27220	4	a	hey , are you single ? this seems like a love connection to me ! 
27221	0	a	 after you my good sir . 
27222	1	a	no , i insist . 
27223	0	a	i insist . 
27224	0	a	uh , this has got to stop . 
27225	1	a	k . . . kevin ! 
27226	1	a	k , i'm gonna need some help . pam ? 
27227	4	a	i don't think i should . 
27228	2	a	oh , yeah . pregnant . 
27229	4	a	right here . little michael scott- 
27230	2	a	no , i told you i don't like that joke . it is a boy . we found out early . 
27231	4	a	much different the second time around . and i have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office . 
27232	4	a	wait , when did we start calling it that-
27233	4	a	well , i am a few months ahead of you . 
27234	1	a	hoist him aloft . c'mon darryl . lift , lift darryl . 
27235	2	a	no one should be planking at all . 
27236	0	a	thank you , yes . dwight , my enforcer , my number two , can you take care of this ? 
27237	1	a	say no more . 
27238	1	a	 kids , don't try planking . it's dangerous . 'specially with me around . 
27239	2	a	you watching that commercial again ? why do you keep watching it , if you know it's just gonna make you cry ? 
27240	4	a	because everything makes me cry , so what's the difference ? this dog , he just wants to protect his bone . 
27241	2	a	he's got a bank vault . that's a start . 
27242	4	a	not enough though . 
27243	2	a	the new ceo works out of the conference room about half the time . but whenever he takes a break , he does these weird walks around the office . and you never know who he's gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks . you just hope it's not you . and yet , you hope it is you too . it's strange . 
27244	0	a	hey , robert . we have that 9:30am casual chit-chat scheduled . i emailed you about it last night to confirm . and again this morning . 
27245	0	a	first item on the agenda: can i get everyone an extra long columbus day weekend . item number two , connect with the guy . robert california , what does he think of me ? don't know , super care . number three , time permitting , we lost our biggest client .

27248	0	a	the friday before columbus day . thoughts ? 
27249	0	a	just making chit-chat . kind of a medium year for women's soccer , no ? 
27250	1	a	what are you looking at ? 
27251	2	a	it's , it's nothing . 
27252	1	a	it can't be nothing . 
27253	2	a	it's just a list of our names , split into two columns . 
27254	2	a	okay , just wait one second , alright ? i will copy it . do you have a pen ? 
27255	2	a	no . okay . um , i'll take a photo of it . dwight , can you throw me my phone ? 
27256	1	a	 nice catch . 
27257	4	a	if he comes out , distract him . 
27258	2	a	we don't need a warning signal , kevin . we can see him right there-
27259	2	a	i promise you , we don't need a warning-

27268	4	a	he left it at reception and we photocopied it . 
27269	0	a	oh , okay . i don't want any part of this . 
27270	4	a	maybe it's a list of people he's gonna fire . 
27271	2	a	okay , it's not that pam . you know , i was thinking it reminds me of those lists dwight used to make . 
27272	1	a	this is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats . this is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts . here's something . who would eat who in an 'alive' situation . no . . . that can't be it . 
27273	0	a	i gotta say . kinda seems like the left side's the side to be on . me , jim , dwight , darryl . no offense pam . 
27274	2	a	i don't think it's-
27275	4	a	'scuse me ? 
27276	1	a	shhh , pam . c'mon , don't be such a right-sider . 
27277	0	a	we couldn't crack it . 
27278	0	a	he'll know that we looked at his private notebook . 
27279	0	a	i'm already working on this columbus day thing for you guys and it's starting to stack up . feels like a lot . one thing at a time . 
27280	0	a	what's up ? weird thing . totally awkward , but you left your notebook on the reception desk . 
27281	0	a	and it was open . and people saw this . and they're just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is . 
27282	0	a	it's a photocopy from your notebook . 
27283	0	a	no . they did . and they asked me to ask about it . 
27284	0	a	what ? 
27285	0	a	that is fascinating . and , by the way , i am so glad i asked . people were just sort of- did you just move my name ? 
27286	0	a	okay . robert's in the annex , everybody think quick . what do these groups have in common ? 
27287	2	a	that's not it . 
27288	2	a	mmum , still wrong . 
27289	0	a	stanley , you do puzzles all day . whatdo we got ? 
27290	0	a	thank you . a little much needed comic relief , but we really need to figure this out guys . 
27291	1	a	no , it's not . here's how we find out . let's line up and compare the lines , see if we learn anything . okay , left-siders over here . right-siders , line up over here . face each other . match it by height and relative weight . let's just size each other up here and left side of the list' attack ! 
27292	2	a	wait , wait , wait ! stop ! stop ! stop ! will you stop ? !

27320	4	a	 oh , text from jim . 'this is getting very weird . will explain later . '
27321	4	a	 oh , text from kevin . 
27322	4	a	i used to be young and cute and sorta funny and i could do those cute , little cartoons . and everyone who came through here was like , 'who's that receptionist ? i like her . ' now i'm just a fat mom . yeah , and you take one look at me and you're like , 'oh , loser . '
27323	0	a	c'mon pam . chins up , okay ? bad joke . look around this room . does this look like a group of losers ? seriously ? 
27324	4	a	oh . oh god . 
27325	0	a	yeah ? 
27326	1	a	oh , we did . it was the best time . and you know what ? now it's over . back to work everyone . you too andy . 
27327	2	a	well , that was certainly an odd lunch . is everything alright ? 
27328	4	a	yeah , i'm fine . 
27329	0	a	when i was a salesman i could just be like 'not my job , not my prob . i'm going to the warehouse to polish my knob . ' metaphorically , of course . but now , it is my job and my prob . 
27330	0	a	hi , robert ? can you come out here please it's really important . just wanted to clarify something . some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered , uh , let's say top-tier and others would be second-tier . 
27331	0	a	thank you . great . robert . i said winners and losers . is that what you're talking about ? 
27332	0	a	oh , that , it might- that might actually be what i'm thinking of . can you clarify that ? 
27333	0	a	no . no , no . 
27334	0	a	i'm going in there . 
27335	0	a	i know that every time i talk to you things just seem to get worse . but , you don't know these people and i do . and if i let you work with faulty information , well , then i'm not doing my job as regional manager . so , please take this pen and change your list . 
27336	0	a	well , then i will make a new list for you . stanley . . . you may think he's a lazy grump , but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office ? and you may think he's hard to love , but did you know that he's in , not one , but two long-term romantic relationships ? 
27337	0	a	meredith palmer . . . supplier relations . the word 'no' not even in her vocabulary . and just to show you that i'm being fair . you had gabe in the loser column . i think that is astute . good call . pam , easily the most creative and kind person i have ever worked with . 
27338	1	a	jim , shut the door . this is just gross . 
27339	2	a	shhh . 
27340	0	a	erin hannon , the receptionist and my closest confidant . a winner if there ever was one .

27352	0	a	i gotta say , i think it's kinda cool not knowing . it's like one of those movies that ends on a note of mystery . did the butler do it ? are they ghosts ? you know ? it's kinda sophisticated . 
27353	4	a	 yeah , i hate those endings . 
27354	1	a	 man , it's like hoisting a manatee . i can't get a grip it's so vast . 
27355	2	a	ryan ? a little help ? 
27356	1	a	god . how do whalers do it ? 
27357	0	a	creed ! wha- this is a safety issue with you . there's no way to know if you're dead !

27384	2	a	k , kevin , are you saying 'see the world' ? or 'sea world ? '
27385	2	a	no , see ? right there , that's the problem with your method . 'cause i still don't know if you're saying 'sea world' or 'see the world , ' and it's taking a lot of time to explain it .

27629	0	a	no . not joking . this is real . . . . painfully real , what is happening right now . 
27630	2	a	there's gotta be a better way to do this . this is literally how they built the pyramids . 
27631	1	a	well , they whipped people which was helpful . but you're right . we should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than madge or heday . 
27632	2	a	yeah not that they're not smart people . 
27633	1	a	 no , no . very smart . uh , theirs is more of a physical intelligence . 
27634	2	a	i'd go with that . 
27635	1	a	like baboons or elephants . 
27636	2	a	not that , don't . . . 
27637	2	a	it's a great idea kev , i don't think it applies here though , so maybe we just-

27664	2	a	so , it's not the dumbest idea . 
27665	1	a	it's not the greatest one either . . . 
27666	2	a	but , the fact remains we gotta move these boxes . 
27667	1	a	and it's clear we're not going to carry them . 
27668	2	a	so sadly , it's the best idea on the table . 
27669	1	a	exactly . 
27670	2	a	is he ok ? 
27671	1	a	yep . he'll be fine . 
27672	0	a	surprise ! your new crew .

27682	0	a	ok what ? 
27683	0	a	ah , ok . 
27684	0	a	yeah . that makes sense . ok . good , alright .

27686	0	a	why is the truck empty ? 
27687	1	a	uh , it's not totally empty . 
27688	1	a	ok , i can see why you're angry , you're coming into this cold . but believe me a lot of thought went into this . 
27689	2	a	ok , alright , that's . . . look . all we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things . 
27690	1	a	i don't know . 
27691	2	a	that's alright . 
27692	2	a	doesn't matter what the name is . se��or loadenstein , that's stupid . 
27693	2	a	that's ok , we're good . 
27694	0	a	no , jim . tell us why it's called se��or loadenstein . 
27695	2	a	porque es muy rapido . 
27696	1	a	ok . you know what ? it's been a real busy day , what do you say we put all this away . 
27697	1	a	it's uh , it's in beta testing . 
27698	1	a	get the thing , go ! lube it up , kevin ! start mopping . 
27699	4	a	we came to an agreement . we're going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain . 
27700	2	a	right . it's city and country combined . 
27701	4	a	just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world . 
27702	2	a	and i can fish right from the window of pam's pottery studio . and we can chat any time we want . 
27703	4	a	just like now . 
27704	2	a	 just like now . . . . too bad the schools are terrible . 
27705	4	a	oh . .

27707	4	a	what are you gonna do ? 
27708	2	a	ok , ok . we are so close . all we have to do is figure out that corner and we're basically there . 
27709	1	a	i know . kevin , we've been friends for a long time , right ? 
27710	1	a	so if i was to ask you to sacrifice your body and lay down on a greasy corner and act as a human bumper shield-
27711	2	a	ok , dwight ! come on . here , i think i have an idea . 
27712	1	a	i wouldn't be asking you lightly , now would i ?

27714	2	a	dammit dwight ! 
27715	2	a	ok , i have a question . why is the truck so far away ? 
27716	2	a	ok , i just asked that ques- , i don't know . i mean it seems like the door is huge , right ? so you should be able to back the truck up to the paper . 
27717	1	a	yeah , why is it so far away jim ? 
27718	2	a	so this warehouse has been around for what ? like a thousand years ? and they never thought to back the truck up into it ? i guess sometimes it just takes a fresh set of eyes . alright ! 
27719	2	a	whoa whoa whoa ! 
27720	2	a	no ! stop ! stop stop stop stop ! you're way over ! ok , you gotta cut it ! cut it hard ! stop stop stop stop ! stop , stop ! dammit dwight . great .

27727	2	a	you've seen it , right ? 
27728	0	a	no . 
27729	4	a	andy , somebody defaced it . 
27730	0	a	what ? morning , stanley . 
27731	2	a	there's this thing that people tend to do with billboards . how do i put this ? if there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a . . . phallic shape , interacting with the artwork , it'll happen , and andy gave them that opportunity . 
27732	0	a	erin , how long did we order those billboards for ? 
27733	0	a	oh , god . i need you to call the billboard company . 
27734	0	a	which one did you see ? 
27735	2	a	okay , don't be gross . 
27736	1	a	 what's going on ?

27944	4	a	really .

27961	4	a	thank you . 
27962	2	a	oscar , how are you on that side ? 
27963	4	a	this isn't about sides . this is about me seeing a blueish gray old man in the mirror and then he vanishes . 
27964	4	a	no , creed . 
27965	2	a	but that would make more sense . 
27966	0	a	 hey everybody it's closing time . you don't got to go home but you can't stay here . 
27967	0	a	closing time . 
27968	0	a	every office needs an end of the day tradition . something to tell you the day is over . otherwise , you go home and the night just feels like more day . it's weird . 
27969	0	a	closing time
27970	2	a	 . . . w r k .

27973	0	a	come on pam ! 
27974	4	a	let's see . andy has been manager for a hundred and five days . which means i've heard 'closing time' a hundred and five times . still don't know the words . tah wa ta way hm hm home and home and home .

27978	1	a	 sorry , go ahead . 
27979	1	a	wha'yes . your attention . uh because' no that is all . 
27980	1	a	last night i dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world . the vice president had all the power . athletes fought for silver medals . women were considered the best gender . and stadiums of fans shouted 'we're number two ! ' . as with all my dreams , i'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants . 
27981	0	a	umpf'that's not good . chalk that one up to tweedle dee and tweedle dumb out there . 
27982	0	a	they're both kevin . oscar is the sex and the city gang and angela , if you can picture'
27983	0	a	i would agree with that . 
27984	0	a	end the mistakes , easy-
27985	0	a	i would like that . 
27986	2	a	i'm just saying with the nba lockout i think roller derby's in a really good place now . so'my pitch is'me , pam , you and , someone else maybe justine . 
27987	2	a	is that off again ? 
27988	2	a	ok . 
27989	1	a	i may have a little solution to our mistakes problem . this is a project i've been working on for quite some time and today , might be the day to use it . 
27990	0	a	what do you got ? 
27991	1	a	 allow me . you're going to love this . ugh'should've used a shorter string . never mind , i know it by heart . it is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work . 
27992	0	a	sounds controversial . 
27993	1	a	have i not been worthy of your trust ? have i not been a reliable number two ? 
27994	0	a	do not go there ! you're the deuce i never want to drop . 
27995	1	a	well , i can make this work . i'll set it up right now . just need your go ahead . 
27996	0	a	go do the voodoo that you do so well . 
27997	1	a	i will do my voodoo . 
27998	0	a	mmhmmm . 
27999	0	a	hi guys . i just wanted to say that , you all have been doing amazing work . , really . 
28000	0	a	and i'd like to add that your work has been a little sloppy . so , dwight and i have implemented a new program that we like to call'dwight'
28001	1	a	the accountability booster . it registers every time a mistake has been made in the office . from a late delivery to an accounting error . five strikes in a day equals a home run . one home run and you're out . 
28002	0	a	if we as a group make five mistakes in a day , something bad happens like we block minesweeper . 
28003	1	a	or in this case an email gets sent to robert california containing the consultants report from last year . remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown ? and as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him . 
28004	1	a	robert's favorite songs: creep by tlc , creep by radio head . you remember that one jim ? there is no way he hasn't strangled at least one stripper . oscar . he eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him . kelly . 
28005	1	a	p . s . we should should kill him . 
28006	2	a	wait , so you installed a doomsday device ? 
28007	1	a	no , it's an accountability booster . 
28008	2	a	which when it goes off it destroys everything . very similar to a doomsday device . 
28009	1	a	jim , you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac . now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other . i am confident that you guys are equal to the task . 
28010	1	a	smile'nod . smile and nod . 
28011	1	a	they are making me out to be a bond villian . i like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world . like'not doctor moreau someone good . doctor frankenstein , doctor jekyll , not them . doctor'
28012	0	a	are you sure this is a good idea ? i mean the thing about this office is , we make a lot of mistakes . 
28013	1	a	but the device will change that . without a safety net , people will improve . 
28014	0	a	alright everybody , looks like we need to be getting to work . be extra careful . double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha . 
28015	1	a	 oh , there's one mistake . 
28016	0	a	dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so i'
28017	1	a	it's not a doomsday device , gosh . we can do this you guys . 
28018	0	a	alright everybody , you are doing great ! 
28019	1	a	well , i wouldn't say that . three mistakes already is pretty terrible , but i do see improvement . meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work . 
28020	2	a	dwight , question . 
28021	1	a	no questions . 
28022	2	a	if this doomsday device goes off . . . 
28023	1	a	accountability booster . 
28024	2	a	if this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs . are you going to feel good about that ? 
28025	1	a	i haven't even considered it . that's how sure i am that this accountability booster is going to work . 
28026	2	a	ok . 
28027	1	a	how about scrantonstrangler666 . 
28028	2	a	nope . 
28029	1	a	no . oh shoot . ha ha ha'you guys are never gonna shut down the machine , ok ? but i appreciate your energy and your team work . if you applied this to your regular work , you won't even notice that the device is there , watching you ready to strike . 
28030	2	a	hmm'heda . no . 
28031	0	a	gahhh . that's five strikes . 
28032	0	a	dwight we got five strikes . 
28033	1	a	really ? 
28034	0	a	did the email go out or'
28035	1	a	it goes out automatically at five p . m . 
28036	0	a	well , th- there's gotta be a way to stop it . 
28037	1	a	well , i would have to enter my password in order to cancel it . 
28038	0	a	ok ! dwight you may now enter your password . 
28039	1	a	no . 
28040	0	a	what ? ! 
28041	1	a	you don't deserve to have this branch . five mistakes in less than a day . 
28042	1	a	no you didn't , phyllis . you complained the whole time . you yelled at me . you tried to break into the machine . what ? ! 
28043	1	a	hey , you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome . what about you , kevin ? what about you and your fake task ? can you tell me now where paper comes from ? 
28044	1	a	ha . ok , alright . andy back me up here , please . 
28045	0	a	nn no . 
28046	1	a	what ? 
28047	0	a	no ! 
28048	1	a	good luck finding a new job idiots . i'll make sure to write you a glowing reference . glowingly negative . 
28049	4	a	i bet he went home . 
28050	0	a	some of us should go there and talk some sense into him . get him to stop that email . 
28051	0	a	pam , you should come with me . dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us . 
28052	0	a	kevin has that lovability . 
28053	0	a	jim , i want you to go find robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five . you can try to delete it or something . 
28054	2	a	ok , where is he ? 
28055	2	a	i'll try both . 
28056	1	a	 oh . come to reason with me ?

28116	2	a	ok , he didn't fix it . the brightness level was all the way down . 
28117	4	a	you couldn't fix it . 
28118	2	a	i wasn't here that day . 
28119	4	a	yes you were .

28121	4	a	i don't think so , babe . 
28122	2	a	ok , this is crazy . 
28123	2	a	i have never played squash . but i have seen it in countless 80's movies and it seems like the most common mistake is that you serve too hard and hit yourself right in the squash balls . so , as long as i don't do that , i think i'll be alright . 
28124	2	a	 good game . you are a worthy opponent . you wanna play one more ? 
28125	2	a	no ? come on . 
28126	2	a	well , that is . . . because you didn't realize that . . . i was left-handed .

28139	0	a	and come and tell me . doesn't matter what it is .

28164	2	a	hmm . doubt it . 
28165	4	a	you doubt it ? 
28166	2	a	what's that ?

28168	2	a	honestly i have no idea . i just figured we'd save her from ryan right ? 
28169	0	a	i'm delivering it from the fridge . it's like a porno . hey did anyone order a pizza ? 
28170	0	a	yeah and we're not about to make love . i just thought maybe you'd want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes . 
28171	0	a	uh you tell me 
28172	4	a	it's going to be good to have someone hot at pam's desk huh ? 
28173	4	a	i'm kidding ! oh my gosh you guys ! she's obviously super cute i get it . but i'd like to point out there's 50 pounds more of me to love if that's your thing .

28175	4	a	really well thank you all . 
28176	1	a	ok ok ok no no no . this is disgusting . you realize what you're saying ? the hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman . 
28177	1	a	no ! there are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction . and you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman . 
28178	1	a	yes you are . and another thing . helen mirren was born helen mironov . that's right . you're fake salivating over a soviet era russian . 
28179	0	a	 ske-be-do-bah-bap-bah-de , ske-be-de-bapa-de-bapa-boopa-dooten-bebe-daten-booray .

28196	2	a	nope . 
28197	4	a	i'm not asking if you're in to her . just , objectively , do you find her attractive ? 
28198	2	a	and i'm telling you , i don't . 
28199	4	a	you don't find cathy attractive ? 
28200	2	a	no , i don't . 
28201	2	a	no , i'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that i find her replacement objectively attractive . just like i'm not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun . it's true , but it doesn't help anybody . 
28202	4	a	look at her . even i want some fries with that shake . 
28203	2	a	okay . uh , i don't . so are we good ? 
28204	1	a	that's just absurd . 
28205	4	a	yes , because she's hot , right ? 
28206	1	a	her breasts are large , her waist is small , her reproductive health in ample evidence . and facial symmetry- come on . 
28207	4	a	the thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently . like you're a kid almost . they lose all sense of boundaries . they start acting weird , telling you things that clearly aren't true . i know it sounds nuts , but i think dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth . 
28208	4	a	dwight , am i hot right now ? 
28209	1	a	why would i or anyone else think that you're hot right now ? i can't impregnate you , and that's the driving force between male-female attraction . 
28210	4	a	what about before ? was i attractive before ? 
28211	1	a	meh . . . you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight , gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time . gradual recovery and , uh , well now , obviously , you're at an all-time low . 
28212	4	a	hmm . i think jim's lying to me about not being attracted to cathy . 
28213	1	a	you think jim's lying ? that's so cute . i know he's lying . 
28214	4	a	five bucks if you can get him to admit it . 
28215	1	a	done . i never touch a pregnant woman . 
28216	4	a	yep , that's the dwight i need . 
28217	1	a	if we're going to work together , we need some ground rules . 
28218	4	a	okay . 
28219	1	a	rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth . 
28220	4	a	i think so . okay . 
28221	1	a	rule two: we stop at nothing . 
28222	4	a	well , what does that . . . is that . . . okay . 
28223	1	a	rule three: don't fall in love . 
28224	4	a	yep , good . 
28225	1	a	we're gonna bust this guy . 
28226	4	a	honesty is very important to me . 
28227	1	a	so important . and then we will destroy the man himself . 
28228	4	a	let's just see how we feel when we get there . 
28229	1	a	none taken . what do you got ? 
28230	4	a	hmm . 
28231	0	a	yeah , absolutely ! 
28232	0	a	midnight what ? 
28233	4	a	hey , i was talking to cathy . turns out she is single . 
28234	2	a	oh , i stand corrected . 
28235	4	a	i thought it might be fun to set her up with someone . any ideas ? 
28236	2	a	oh , you know who might be good ? mike tibbets . 
28237	4	a	mike tibbets , really ? 
28238	2	a	mm-hmm . 
28239	2	a	not his mom's car . 
28240	2	a	touche ? 
28241	4	a	kelly , calm down . 
28242	4	a	i don't think jim cares about his hair . 
28243	1	a	i don't see what's so ugly about him . he's got the broad face of a brewer . 
28244	4	a	jim's on to me . 
28245	1	a	hmm ? 
28246	4	a	yeah , jim barely talks to mike . we had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile . jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it . 
28247	1	a	just ugly enough to have deniability . 
28248	4	a	yep . 
28249	2	a	mike tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy i know . so if that was for the matchmaker test , i think i'm in the clear . if that wasn't for the matchmaker test , then . . . cathy , he's a really nice guy . 
28250	1	a	well , jim may be lying with his words , but he can't lie with his body . 
28251	4	a	no , kelly , don't . 
28252	1	a	the male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs . the puffing of the chest , mirroring , increased blood flow to the crotch . i say we start there . 
28253	1	a	with the crotch . 
28254	1	a	psst . we're not here . 
28255	1	a	exactly . 
28256	1	a	okay , just shut it . 
28257	4	a	is he puffing out his chest ? 
28258	1	a	i can't tell . it's unnaturally sunken . busted . he just was mirroring . did you see that ? 
28259	4	a	no . maybe he just said something funny . 
28260	1	a	jim has no discernible sense of humor , pam . you should know that . 
28261	4	a	i think he's just making her laugh . 
28262	1	a	time for me to find out . 
28263	4	a	why's he making her laugh so much ? 
28264	1	a	just going to walk over here- whoa , whoa , i'm slipping and falling ! oh , stumbling , i need something to grab on to ! 
28265	2	a	dwight ! 
28266	1	a	i'm fine , i'm totally fine . 
28267	2	a	dwight ! dwight ! 
28268	1	a	yes ? wha- jim . 
28269	2	a	 sorry about that . 
28270	1	a	aw , cramp , i'm just- 
28271	2	a	dwight ! why ? 
28272	1	a	i'm sorry , i fell down , mr . balance . 
28273	2	a	leave . 
28274	1	a	 does your husband have very soft erections ? because if not , i just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing . 
28275	4	a	why was he making her laugh so much ? 
28276	4	a	oh , hey , i'll just be a second . 
28277	4	a	okay . 
28278	2	a	mm-hmm ? 
28279	2	a	 told you . 
28280	4	a	oscar , cathy has a question ! 
28281	4	a	 yeah ? 
28282	2	a	you okay ? 
28283	4	a	why won't you just admit that she's attractive ? it's kind of annoying that you won't say it . 
28284	2	a	okay , what can i do to make you believe me ? 
28285	4	a	well , dwight had this idea , and i thought it was kind of crazy . but maybe that's where we are now . 
28286	1	a	she called it crazy ? aw , man , that's insulting . all i did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test . monitoring his blood pressure , pulse , perspiration , and breathing rate . 
28287	4	a	yeah , its nuts . but i don't know what else to do . 
28288	1	a	and she called it nuts ? 
28289	0	a	did you know that lisa toured with chaka khan ? 
28290	0	a	well , we are playing . we're all playing together . these are our jam buddies . it's a jam session . we go where the music takes us . 
28291	1	a	come on . 
28292	2	a	stop shoving me . 
28293	1	a	 stop shoving me . stop grabbing my penis . grow up . take off your jacket and take a seat . when it lies , the human body exhibits many telltale signs . 
28294	2	a	 really ? 
28295	4	a	this could all go away if you just tell me the truth . 
28296	1	a	why don't you go check out the sympathy cards , old man ? now i'm going to ask you just a few simple questions . wait for this to constrict . here we go . is your name jim halpert ? 
28297	2	a	si . 
28298	4	a	wait , that's it ? that's the question you're going to ask him ? 
28299	1	a	we have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is . 
28300	1	a	 well , that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten . 
28301	2	a	okay , dwight , come on . you can go first . 
28302	1	a	jim , are you serious ? 
28303	2	a	oh , you know what ? this reminds me , cece needs a new toothbrush . 
28304	0	a	maybe we could switch instruments . 
28305	0	a	cause , uh , my body's starting to get bruised . 
28306	0	a	we had to leave because of creative differences . 
28307	0	a	well-
28308	1	a	 okay , you're done . 
28309	1	a	do you really , tin man ? okay , where were we ? 
28310	2	a	no , i'm not worried . because this lie isn't for me , it's for pam . and when she gets her body back and her confidence back . . . yes , i will tell her the truth . that i had feelings for a co-worker today that i haven't had in years . but in my defense , he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time . 
28311	1	a	do you find cathy simms attractive ? 
28312	2	a	no . 
28313	1	a	yep , he's lying . 
28314	4	a	ah , see , was that so hard ? 
28315	2	a	i am not lying . 
28316	4	a	really ? 
28317	2	a	pam , are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test ? 
28318	1	a	i would listen to my homemade test , because your husband is definitely lying . in fact , he's lied about every question . even his name . who are you really ? 
28319	4	a	wait , what ? 
28320	1	a	look at the numbers . every single time , it's come up 150 over 100 . your husband is a pathological liar . 
28321	4	a	jim , you have high blood pressure . 
28322	1	a	oh , he is definitely attracted to her . 
28323	4	a	doesn't your dad have high blood pressure ? 
28324	2	a	yeah , but i don't smoke . 
28325	4	a	when was the last time you went to the doctor ? 
28326	2	a	i don't know . 
28327	1	a	it's important to go every month and get your prostate checked . you can do it at home by yourself with your finger . you just stick it-
28328	4	a	dwight , stop . i'm not kidding , i mean , i need you to take care of yourself . what would we do if something happened to you ? 
28329	2	a	okay , easy . trust me , i'm around for the long-haul . 
28330	1	a	it's not really your choice , is it ? death waits for no man . 
28331	2	a	okay . 
28332	4	a	come on , let's go . i wanna call your doctor . 
28333	1	a	doesn't it worry you in the slightest that jim is not his real name ? 
28334	4	a	just go home . it doesn't matter . 
28335	1	a	but . . . hey , cece's toothbrush . 
28336	2	a	thank you . 
28337	0	a	 rudit-do-do-do-di-do . 
28338	0	a	hey ! all right , obviously we all want to die but we have to get through this . so , gabe go ahead . it's okay . 
28339	4	a	 i'm gonna do it . 
28340	4	a	oh ! i'm going into labor ! oh my goodness ! 
28341	2	a	oh okay , she's going into labor . make way , everybody ! 
28342	4	a	i know it's wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things , but sometimes it's necessary . 
28343	4	a	: i'm going into labor ! 
28344	4	a	i'm going into labor ! 
28345	4	a	i'm going into labor . 
28346	4	a	here we go ! 
28347	0	a	hey guys , uh , can't keep saying you're going into labor . everyone knows you're full of it . 
28348	0	a	never cry wolf . 
28349	2	a	okay . 
28350	4	a	okay . 
28351	4	a	oh ! oh ! 
28352	2	a	oh my god ! 
28353	4	a	i'm really in labor ! this is happening ! 
28354	2	a	okay guys , here we go ! we'll see you ! 
28355	4	a	oh ! 
28356	2	a	how do you feel ? 
28357	4	a	false alarm . 
28358	0	a	 what ? ! they took another client from us ? okay , bye . man ! business is war ! customers , clients- it's like a war out there . 
28359	0	a	i am a leader . but you can only inspire people so much in a place like this . so today i'm turning the inspire-factor up to ten with a little help from my friend america's bloodiest battle . 
28360	0	a	why even read business books ? we should be studying war . going to places like gettysburg . where is that ? 
28361	0	a	 well we should take a fieldtrip there . i mean , that would be so cool . i wonder if that bus downstairs is-
28362	0	a	that sounds super inspiring ! i'm in ! 
28363	1	a	gettysburg ? hmm . could be interesting . second-most northern battle in the civil war . 
28364	1	a	ha ! 
28365	1	a	the civil war history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of schrute farms . whatever . i'm over it . it's just grossly irresponsible . 
28366	0	a	charge ! 
28367	0	a	yeah , well , the bus has free wifi and i made special low-sugar lunches for everyone . and is anyone kosher or halal ? 
28368	0	a	dates , tabbouleh , and a bagel with cream cheese . 
28369	0	a	you know , it's the same as the kosher option . there's a lesson in there . i mean , i can't force you to go . you're not my slaves . thanks to gettysburg . but . . . who's coming with me ? 
28370	1	a	guess i'm a sucker for historical fiction . 
28371	0	a	anyone who's not going , you're dead to me . you're uninvited . i don't want you to come . but , fyi , there will be leftover turkey and pesto sammies in the fridge . 
28372	0	a	 one for you . 
28373	0	a	and one for you . 
28374	2	a	cool . thanks . 
28375	0	a	and- oh . you missed your head . there you go . phyllis , think fast ! 
28376	0	a	all right , guys , a little foreplay before we do it . fans of ken burns' jazz will most certainly enjoy civil war . 
28377	0	a	it's just not appropri- i mean , if we were going to visit bradley cooper's birthplace , i'd be the first one suggesting it . i'd be rooting for it . 
28378	0	a	all right , all right , all right . 
28379	4	a	here . like it ? 
28380	4	a	i can't get a fire pit . i have two babies . 
28381	4	a	plants and- hi , robert ! hey , um , how are you doing ? good to see you again . 
28382	0	a	you guys . . . 
28383	0	a	get excited ! 
28384	0	a	all right ! we're here . limitless can wait . 
28385	0	a	woo-hoo ! ladies and gentlemen the eighteen hundreds await you . we can watch limitless on the way back . 
28386	0	a	woo ! 
28387	0	a	whoa , where you going ? 
28388	2	a	visitor center . gonna grab a map for the memorials , right ? 
28389	0	a	yeah , we're not going to the visitor center . we're not tourists . 
28390	2	a	no , of course we're not tourists . we're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour . 
28391	0	a	unless you're going on the very specially-created and meticulously-researched andy bernard tour . 
28392	0	a	after chancellorsville , lee brought his army up the shenandoah valley , right through here ! they stopped in this field for a picnic , which they called lunch . 
28393	1	a	total deaths belongs to gettysburg but when you're talking about d . p . a . , that's deaths per acre . . . 
28394	1	a	 . . . nothing beats the battle of schrute farms . 
28395	1	a	oh , it is . and you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home . i mean , it makes the battle of gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush . i'm telling you , they're heartbreaking too . so beautifully written . 
28396	1	a	the truth . 
28397	1	a	no , no , no ! you're filling her head with nonsense . you and the history books . i'm telling the truth . 
28398	1	a	yes , thank you . all of history has been whitewashed . 
28399	1	a	okay , i will . i don't know who that is , but i'm gonna tell you this-
28400	1	a	gettysburg was very important . credit where credit is due , okay ? big , mad props to gettysburg . was it , however , the most northern battle of the civil war ? 
28401	1	a	not by a long shot ! 
28402	1	a	no , it was not ! 
28403	1	a	no , it was not . was it the second-most northern ? 
28404	1	a	sure ! i will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle ! 
28405	1	a	was it the northernmost ? no . get out of here , oscar . 
28406	1	a	excuse me , i got a question for you . 
28407	1	a	can you tell us about the battle of schrute farms ? 
28408	1	a	really . okay , follow-up question . how much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut ? 
28409	0	a	we don't need to bother this poor gentleman . i know exactly where we're going . giddy up ! tallyho ! 
28410	4	a	okay . you know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools . i was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us . . . and as , you know , as i tell it , i don't like it . unless , of course , you are responding to it . 
28411	4	a	um , excuse me . i'm gonna go to the bathroom . 
28412	4	a	at this point , when you're this pregnant , it's kind of like senior spring . the other day i spit my gum out on the carpet . 
28413	2	a	by the way , did we leave all the food on the bus ? 
28414	0	a	let's talk about food for a second . food for thought . 
28415	2	a	yeah , that's what i had for breakfast and i think that's probably why i'm still hungry . 
28416	0	a	hunger ! hunger for victory ! hunger for honor . hunger for pride . 
28417	2	a	only two hundred dollars ? 
28418	0	a	get the flag ! get the flag ! come on , big tuna . what you gonna do about it ? we got a flag right here . wee-hoo ! 
28419	0	a	spangler springs is a mile this way . 
28420	2	a	oh wow . so that's two miles if you incorporate the walk back . 
28421	0	a	its' i mean come on . 
28422	0	a	alright fine . you know what ' i guess this place just hasn't rubbed off on you the way i hoped it would . i'm still going . and i'm not going to ask anymore . i'm not even going to look back . i'm just going to assume that you're with me . 
28423	1	a	 you said you weren't going to look back . 
28424	1	a	really ? 
28425	1	a	well . anyone employed by the gettysburg industrial complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the battle of schrute farms . 
28426	1	a	yes ! ha ! prepare to be refuted ! go on . 
28427	1	a	hallowed ground . 
28428	1	a	i've seen enough . 
28429	0	a	 dammit . 
28430	0	a	you guys came . where's everyone else ? 
28431	0	a	yeah i asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there . i guess he follows orders . 
28432	2	a	yeah sorry everyone else didn't come . i think they're just tired . with holes in their shoes . and they have dysentery . 
28433	0	a	even without an audience you're still at it . 
28434	2	a	what are you talking about ? 
28435	0	a	our office has a disease . and it goes by many names . sarcasm . snark . wisecracks . you take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes . that's what you did with this trip . 
28436	0	a	you don't like the hats ? 
28437	2	a	they're terrible . 
28438	0	a	they just didn't turn out how i wanted . in my head they were cooler , but they do look weird . 
28439	0	a	charge ! 
28440	0	a	it's kind of a haul , so we should probably get going . and tuna , i made a special sandwich for you , guess which kind . 
28441	2	a	tuna ? 
28442	0	a	yes ! tuna of the land . turkey . with pesto . 
28443	2	a	and to drink ? 
28444	0	a	water . 
28445	2	a	oh-ho , i am in . 
28446	2	a	i'm excited , i've actually never been to gettysburg . uh , my family was gonna go once , but then my brothers convinced me if was full of dead soldier zombies , so i freaked out and we turned the car around . but i'm older now , i can outrun a zombie . 
28447	0	a	getting everyone on the bus , check . giving everyone hats , check . sexiest eastern european girls , uh , check . 
28448	0	a	please ! everyone and their mother goes to devil's den . it's the olive garden of gettysburg . 
28449	0	a	well , i meant that in a bad way . obviously it tastes good , but it's not cool . 
28450	2	a	where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground ? 
28451	0	a	that is what i'm showing you . 
28452	1	a	i know what you guys are all thinking right now: hey , let's go pee on the grave of some confederate soldiers , but you know what ? joke's on you . it only makes the flowers grow back more beautifully . 
28453	1	a	best thing you can do for the deceased is to pee on their graves . then you dance and work the urine into the root systems . doesn't hurt to have a smile on your face , either . 
28454	2	a	it's locked . 
28455	1	a	it's not locked , gimme that . . . 
28456	2	a	that's weird , if it's not locked , why isn't it opening ? 
28457	1	a	it's , it's latched closed . 
28458	2	a	ok , you know what ? andy probably has the number for this guy . i'm gonna find him . 
28459	0	a	 everybody beat it . don't beat it , stay where you are . 
28460	0	a	what did you say ? 
28461	0	a	what would you say ? 
28462	0	a	that is exactly the right thing to say ! do it ! git-er-done ! phyllis , you just married joe order , you're new name is phyllis order , get it ? 
28463	0	a	jim , in regards to our high-five scheduled for four pm today , it has been moved up to now . yes . 
28464	2	a	we didn't have one scheduled . 
28465	1	a	 oh , little help . wow your hair is really thinning . 
28466	1	a	standing is proven to be healthier , increases productivity and just looks cooler . picture someone doing something heroic . now was he sitting or standing ? not counting fdr . 
28467	1	a	every second you sit there is an hour off your life . look at all of you . i feel like you're in a suicide cult . 
28468	1	a	oh yeah ? 
28469	2	a	hey guys let's just all admit it . ok ? dwight's better than us . he had the guts to stop sitting . and he's never , ever going to go back on it right ?

28477	2	a	prank ! 
28478	1	a	oh that's real creative . 
28479	2	a	you know what it's not my best . because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right ? 
28480	1	a	i could , but i just don't feel like it loser . 
28481	2	a	because you're sitting ? 
28482	1	a	standing . 
28483	2	a	ok . 
28484	1	a	don't ! 
28485	2	a	because you're sitting ? 
28486	1	a	standing . 
28487	2	a	you know i have to do this . 
28488	1	a	i know . 
28489	0	a	 andrew' baines' bernard . 
28490	2	a	i think you could just do andy bernard . 
28491	0	a	andrew baines bernard . i love filling these out . because it's like taking a test , but i know the answers . 
28492	0	a	what was that ? 
28493	2	a	i don't know . he wasn't talking to me . but if i were you i wouldn't hire his wife . 
28494	0	a	hey there . it's a pleasure . 
28495	0	a	i would love to . but i have to be completely honest with you guys . we're 100 percent staffed up . 
28496	0	a	alright . 
28497	1	a	knock , knock , knock , knock , knock . 
28498	1	a	 remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics ? 
28499	1	a	well today's your lucky day . i have opened in this very office building dwight schrute's gym for muscles . you wanna take a look ? 
28500	1	a	your path from obesity begins right here ! 
28501	1	a	obese people in my office are a drain on resources . chairs wear out faster , it takes more freon to keep them cool , they flush the toilets more often , plus their massive bms bust the rivets on my pipes . but a gym turns fat into cash . 
28502	0	a	alright ! the dm express is pulling out . 
28503	0	a	we will start here at erinville . 
28504	0	a	reception . your classic one-man operation . 
28505	0	a	i was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over san francisco . just saying . 
28506	0	a	i'll explore exploring it . 
28507	0	a	ok uh next stop on the tour sales . here we go . station stop jim halpert . oh boy our resident truth teller . alright have at it . let 'er rip . what do you hate about this place ? 
28508	2	a	well it's sales . so you have to be able to live in the world of rejection . 
28509	1	a	maybe you do . hi . i'm dwight . sales is really not so hard ok ? it's paper . we have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it . 
28510	0	a	jim ? 
28511	2	a	well it's not that easy . it's kind of sometimes difficult . 
28512	1	a	it's the second easiest job in the world . being a mom . 
28513	1	a	that is true . 
28514	0	a	you know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head mr . dwight schrute . 
28515	1	a	that's me . 
28516	0	a	dwight why don't you tell susan about some of your hobbies . survival skills . ranking of animals . 
28517	1	a	maybe over a beer after she's closed her first sale . 
28518	0	a	oh how am i supposed to pull this off ? . the entire office is being nice to her than they've ever been to me . what i wouldn't give for one of phyllis' classic room clearing farts right now . 
28519	1	a	ready ? what do you think ? 
28520	1	a	darryl . . . 
28521	0	a	but we already have a surplus of accountants as it is . 
28522	0	a	those are fully staffed as well . 
28523	0	a	 yes . 
28524	0	a	let me beat around the bush for a second . our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about-
28525	0	a	there are lots of considerations . 
28526	0	a	alright . well then welcome aboard . 
28527	0	a	we get you over to hr and then we get you set up with accounting . hang on . hello ? 
28528	0	a	hi gam-gam . 
28529	0	a	are you taking your med-meds ? 
28530	0	a	we promised we'd never say goodbye . 
28531	1	a	attention ! i am now accepting memberships for dwight schrute's gym for muscles . the first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion . 
28532	1	a	kelly ? 
28533	1	a	that's okay . i know how to build a business . you gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it . then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it . one step at a time . 
28534	0	a	 hey , uh , guys . so robert doesn't want his wife working here . so now that she is , we have to drive her away . 
28535	0	a	i am not asking , i am ordering . 
28536	0	a	it would be great if she were gone by lunch . erin , you're up . find her a place to work , but not too comfortable . 
28537	2	a	no , i don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant . i think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself . i mean , it knows what it's doing . 
28538	2	a	oh , wow . so cute . 
28539	2	a	very cute . 
28540	0	a	 what is going on ? 
28541	0	a	okey-dokey , artichokey . you hate it , don't you ? 
28542	0	a	why would you say that ? 
28543	0	a	it's not that , exactly . 
28544	0	a	let's just say that if you don't want to work here , i am totally prepared to respect that . 
28545	0	a	i don't know . 
28546	0	a	yes ! the dude is an enigma . 
28547	0	a	ah . . . 
28548	1	a	what do you think you're doing ? 
28549	1	a	i build you this temple to the human body , and you're lifting what , five pounds ? 
28550	1	a	i was watching you . you want to know how long it really was ? 
28551	1	a	eight minutes ! 
28552	1	a	is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings ? i want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym ! i'm gonna make you look like lebron james ! 
28553	1	a	that's what i said . 
28554	1	a	i know . 
28555	0	a	 cameras . . . 
28556	0	a	it just was one of those things-
28557	0	a	yes ? 
28558	0	a	no games ? 
28559	0	a	okay . i mean , it was kind of funny , actually . robert storms in and he says , 'in four seconds , my wife's gonna be in here . i told her she could work here . under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen . ' 
28560	0	a	i am lying . i am a compulsive liar . 
28561	0	a	no , it's not . i tell the truth most of the time and i was just telling the truth about your husband . jim knows . he was there . 
28562	2	a	 oh wait , wait , wait ! hold on , hold on . i just need to get through . just real quick . real quick , open . . . uh , okay . 
28563	2	a	 oh . ow . ow . ow . creed . i was never here , all right ? 
28564	2	a	oh boy . 
28565	1	a	this is my gym , my rules . you do exactly as i say , no questions asked . 
28566	1	a	first thing , we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl . ready ? get down on the floor . 
28567	1	a	really ? too embarrassing for you ? huh ? you wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the fonz ? well how do you think the fonz got so cool ? he stretched his pelvic bowl ! 
28568	0	a	 no , no . no , no , no ! don't ! damn it , tuna ! 
28569	2	a	do i ? 
28570	2	a	 i know , i do . 
28571	0	a	jim , i've had enough of your unhelpfulness . 
28572	2	a	i really wish i could help . i'm not really sure how i can . . . 
28573	2	a	that's the thing . see , i didn't want to get in the middle of this . still don't . but here's something: i feel that maybe , if we take a step back , this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse . 
28574	0	a	 i think we've got ourselves an answer . 
28575	0	a	that makes complete sense . thank you all for a wonderful day . 
28576	2	a	perfect ! 
28577	2	a	yes ? 
28578	2	a	yes . all right . great . 
28579	0	a	uh . . . 
28580	0	a	yep . 
28581	0	a	hey , mrs . california .

28583	0	a	yeah . 
28584	0	a	yeah . 
28585	0	a	who knows ? 
28586	0	a	totally . 
28587	0	a	hmm ? 
28588	1	a	you're nothing ! you're so weak , you call yourself a man ? huh ? 
28589	1	a	okay , fine . finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again ! 
28590	1	a	all right , i'll help you . but first , you gotta tell me what your goal is . what do you want ? 
28591	1	a	no ! because if that was the case , the bar would be up by now . what is your goal ? 
28592	1	a	what do you want ! ? ! 
28593	1	a	val kilmer ? i don't buy it . that doesn't make any sense . wow . . . i figured out your goal . i am going to make you the buffest dude val kilmer has ever seen . 
28594	1	a	hey , what are you listening to ? 
28595	1	a	there is no shower . 
28596	1	a	what does this look like , a shower store ? get lost . 
28597	1	a	exercise lengthens life . improves mood , boosts sex drive , and i've already covered the bm of it all . it's miraculous the effect that i will have on their lives . 
28598	0	a	so , roberto californio doesn't want to work with his wife . i get it . and , he wants to give his wife a job . totally get it . what i am struggling with is the part of this that's impossible . 
28599	2	a	this whole thing is making me very uncomfortable . i'm not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else . you know stanley's tie is really the story of the day . . . 
28600	2	a	ok , so that's a disaster . luckily have a two-part plan . one , run . two , hide . it's pretty smart , right ? hi , how you doing ? i'm jim halpert from across the hall . we are redoing our supply closet and i was wondering if i could take a look at yours for some ideas . 
28601	2	a	you absolutely should . he said it was ok , so till you get him , i'll just be in , you know . 
28602	0	a	ugh ! he's always one step ahead of us ! how does he do that ? 
28603	0	a	 christmas tiiiime is heeeere ! wow . thanks guys , that sounded amazing . hi , i'm andy bernard and i am the first office santa ever to make holiday wishes come true . 
28604	0	a	who's excited to get their holiday wishes ? 
28605	0	a	what's that , stanley ? 
28606	0	a	it is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party . 
28607	2	a	i got stanley tickets to see lewis black for his birthday . . . . might not have been the best idea . 
28608	0	a	fulfilled ! brought my bicycle , so i can be your designated driver later . in the event that you drink to much , which is by no means required . 
28609	1	a	what about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood ? 
28610	0	a	that , i cannot do , but i did get you an acre of property on the moon . 
28611	1	a	where ? dark side or light side ? 
28612	0	a	light side .

28619	2	a	yeah . 
28620	0	a	jessica is my super serious girlfriend , who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy . only thing that's not serious , by the way ? our repartee . 
28621	0	a	totally out of your league . so in summation , ho ho ho , please be nice to jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault , and don't go near gam-gam . 
28622	0	a	well you came to the right place . . . . ah , this , this party'll cheer you right up . 
28623	0	a	oh , thank you . 
28624	0	a	well , i hate to have to take my santa hat off , and put on my hard ass hat . but , this is serious . it's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless , wants to switch desk clumps . 
28625	1	a	fine with me . jim can leave anytime he wants . goodbye . 
28626	2	a	it wasn't me . 
28627	0	a	it wasn't either of you . 
28628	2	a	kathy wants to leave our clump ? 
28629	0	a	sh sh sh sh ! don't look . who it was is not important . . . but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy . she or he . 
28630	1	a	i just wanna say , this is not my fault . ok ? the weak always bully the strong . contrary to what you see in the media . i am always acting in self-defense . occasionally preemptive self-defense . 
28631	2	a	ow , what are you doing ? 
28632	0	a	hey ! hey ! respect the hat ! 
28633	2	a	pam never seemed to have a problem with us .

28639	1	a	no , absolutely not . 
28640	0	a	you need consequences . ok ? i want you both walking on eggshells . 
28641	0	a	my ex is meeting my sex . . . . which is always scary , you know ? and not just because you think they might talk about your penis . . . that's just part of it .

28765	0	a	it was a raccoon ! eating a hamburger like a person ! 
28766	1	a	you need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane .

28772	0	a	 shh ! did you hear that ? infinity ! there is an infinity of things that you can do with paper ! now , who wants to buy some paper ? 
28773	2	a	very nice . very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is . 
28774	0	a	i'm talking about you guys ! who in this room , right now , wants to buy some paper ? let's get high on our own supply ! 
28775	0	a	yes ! 
28776	1	a	dwight schrute for robert california ! 
28777	1	a	i'm not here to be given anything . i'm here to take what is mine . 
28778	1	a	gabe ? you don't know ? 
28779	1	a	hmm . impressive office you have here . surrounded by shrubbery , like a squirrel's office . 
28780	1	a	robert . 
28781	1	a	yes . 
28782	1	a	very good . 
28783	0	a	hey c-span . so my dad says an accountant can really help you out , if they're willing to 'play ball . ' those were his words . 
28784	0	a	so make that error ! 
28785	0	a	well , it's just , i know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing , but it's a little more complicated than that . 
28786	0	a	it's just , i really need a real accountant on this . what do you say ? 
28787	0	a	oh . 
28788	0	a	what ? 
28789	0	a	you know what ? go . have fun . 
28790	0	a	there's a trivia contest at a bar in philadelphia . 
28791	2	a	stop right there . i love it . 
28792	0	a	i didn't even say what it is . 
28793	2	a	in philadelphia . 
28794	0	a	but here's the best part . the prize is a thousand dollars , and if we win , we can use that money to buy paper here , close the gap on our eight percent profit increase . . . 
28795	2	a	that's a great idea . 
28796	0	a	yeah ? you like it ? 
28797	2	a	yeah . 
28798	0	a	all right . 
28799	2	a	all right , good stuff . 
28800	0	a	i'm so psyched you guys are into it because i thought- i was like , 'this sounds really stupid . '
28801	0	a	there is one problem with this plan . 
28802	0	a	we'd have to leave work , like , right now , to do this . 
28803	1	a	gabe , i always wondered what it is you did around here . now i found out . you're the bagel guy . 
28804	1	a	meat grinder . 
28805	1	a	you know , gabe ? you could have gone with garbage disposal , incinerator or eraser , and instead you chose toilet . god bless you . you're an american classic . 
28806	1	a	but i can give you this pitch in one minute-
28807	1	a	still an important position . still a chief . 
28808	0	a	you left us no choice , but , this should put a smile on your face . how would you like to be captain of the dunder-mifflin team ? although i reserve the right to overrule you . 
28809	0	a	i've got a quota to hit . i don't care how i hit it . 
28810	2	a	i thought it was a fun idea . 
28811	0	a	wait , what ? everyone in here is gay ? 
28812	0	a	it says that i believe that my staff's intelligence and that i'm willing to try anything . not anything . 
28813	0	a	uh , all right . we need to divide up into teams , but it's winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly . we need an a-team , a backup team and a just-have-fun team . so you guys all know yourselves . 
28814	0	a	a-team . 
28815	2	a	okay . 
28816	0	a	all right , everybody . nice self-awareness . except . . . 
28817	2	a	there's a table over here . 
28818	0	a	oh , we got this ! 
28819	1	a	 there's no fires within eight miles of here . 
28820	1	a	what ? no , no . excuse me ! lady ! get anyone from the coo's office on the phone this instant ! 
28821	0	a	jim , darryl . your time to shine . 
28822	2	a	shawn marion . 
28823	2	a	wrong , for so many reasons . 
28824	2	a	oh my god . lamar odom , yes . 
28825	0	a	you're my sports guys ! you're espn , you're espn classic , ryan is msnbc . i'm e ! , tlc and oxygen . 
28826	1	a	so it's a very simple argument of why i should be put in charge of southeast printer sales . nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me . bottom line , i know the product . i get it ! 
28827	1	a	oh my god . 
28828	1	a	most of all , i believe that character is destiny . and my character is one that- wait why are you smiling ? 
28829	1	a	what's with the smile ? 
28830	1	a	and my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon , behind us . 
28831	1	a	take me to robert . 
28832	1	a	take me to his house . 
28833	1	a	you know where it is . lead me there . 
28834	1	a	listen , you're a perfectly fine toilet . i'm just an extraordinary piece of crap . let's go . 
28835	2	a	 all right . 
28836	0	a	so the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands , and brains , of kevin , meredith , erin and kelly . do i like these odds ? my answer is no . 
28837	1	a	which one is it ? 
28838	1	a	robert ! robert california ! robert ! 
28839	0	a	 whoo ! yeah ! 
28840	0	a	go einsteins ! 
28841	1	a	no thank you . 
28842	1	a	let me tell you why i should be the next manager with a riddle: a manager , a salesman , a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant . the hostess says , 'table for one ? ' how is this possible ? 
28843	1	a	yes , exactly . riddle number two: who is going-
28844	1	a	n . . . it's complicated . 
28845	1	a	it's a job interview , not a flea market . 
28846	1	a	yes . 
28847	0	a	oh , come on ! 
28848	0	a	einsteins ! great work . 
28849	0	a	you know what i thought would be fun ? is we do like uh , a switch-em-up maybe ? since only one of us needs to win , maybe i can get kevin and kelly and put together an all-star team ? 
28850	0	a	alright . well just stay focused , try to concentrate . 
28851	0	a	alright , if you're not going to help us out by buying our own paper , could you sell eight hundred dollars more paper than usual today ? that would be amazing . 
28852	2	a	andy , it's the last day of the quarter . we've already called all our clients , so making that much in a day is going to be tough . 
28853	0	a	not helping , tuna . 
28854	0	a	we gotta figure this out . think of the look on robert's face when we tell him we met our 8% goal . 
28855	0	a	no , that's why . . . that's why i said think of it . 
28856	2	a	andy , we're gonna do our best . but you know what ? at the end of the day seven point . . . whatever percent is pretty good . 
28857	0	a	have i mentioned that it's also quite good for amateur animation ? took me two weeks . 
28858	1	a	oh , ugh . what is this , a meatball ? really ? 
28859	1	a	jim , come on ! that's so juvenile ! what the- 
28860	1	a	ugh .

28870	2	a	i'm sorry , i thought you were making a joke . 
28871	2	a	i guess i thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery . kind of laughing at your own pain , sad clown thing . 
28872	0	a	um , i'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here . 
28873	0	a	well , please tell susan we all say hi .

28971	0	a	obviously i'm going to clean up . 
28972	0	a	stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who's saying , 'hey , we're uptight , you can't dance , ' and then you have to be like , 'oh yeah , mayor stress ? well watch this ! ' and then . . . we dance . oh how we dance . sex also works . 
28973	0	a	hey ! tuna ! he's back . 
28974	2	a	hey . 
28975	0	a	oh , look at this . tuna wrap . 
28976	2	a	okay . 
28977	0	a	 hand roll . 
28978	2	a	yeah . 
28979	2	a	it was pretty uneventful , actually . 
28980	1	a	can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury . makes me question the whole judicial system . 
28981	2	a	uh , hit and run . 
28982	2	a	nope . not guilty . 
28983	1	a	of course you found him not guilty . 'oh , he apologized and i just really want him to like me , mm . '
28984	2	a	we're best friends , actually . we're going wine-tasting next weekend , if you want to come . 
28985	1	a	not coming , have plans . 
28986	2	a	okay . 
28987	2	a	i did get called in to jury duty . and they released me around noon , so , didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day . and then the next morning pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so i took an extra day to help out . and then three other days happened . 
28988	2	a	aw man , i would but i can't miss any more work . 
28989	0	a	come on , judge judy , tell us your case . what were the deets ? 
28990	2	a	mine was actually a pretty boring case , so-
28991	2	a	wow , i'm really sorry . 
28992	2	a	i never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder . the least i could do is give them a good story . 
28993	2	a	 so phyllis , he was here , and then the car came and did- he was like that . yeah , so it had to be a double backflip , actually . 
28994	2	a	oh man , ernesto's . that was our favorite restaurant too . 
28995	1	a	i was in los angeles last year . jim tricked me into thinking i'd won a walk-on part on ncis , but that's not important . while i was being kicked off the lot , i saw food trucks everywhere . everyone in los angeles eats from them . and nobody calls them restaurants . 
28996	1	a	so this whole hit and run thing , there's just one part i can't figure out . you said it was at a four-way stop . . . 
28997	2	a	mm-hmm . 
28998	1	a	and the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane ? 
28999	2	a	mm-hmm . 
29000	1	a	see , that's what i'm having trouble with , because the fact is , you never said he was on a bicycle . busted , halpert ! 
29001	2	a	okay , wait , wait . 
29002	1	a	yes ! andy , get out here . 
29003	2	a	no . i never said he was on a bicycle . i just said i wasn't listening to you . 
29004	1	a	i am making a citizen's arrest . you have the right to remain silent . you have the right to beg for mercy . you have the right to request judgment by combat . dwight's rights . 
29005	0	a	what's up , gangstas ? 
29006	1	a	jim was lying about jury duty . he was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing . i don't know what this pervert likes . fire him ! 
29007	0	a	dwight , not everything is a conspiracy theory . 
29008	1	a	i have jim on the record saying that the vic-
29009	0	a	no . dwight ! i have me on the record , saying to you , take a chill pill . 
29010	1	a	i don't- i don't need to take a chill pill . 
29011	0	a	here , right there . down the hatch . 
29012	1	a	i really don't want to take the chill pill . 
29013	0	a	attaboy . good . now , chill . 
29014	1	a	okay , okay . but let's just say that jim was lying about jury duty . you would have to fire him , right ? 
29015	0	a	yeah , sure , of course . i'd fire him to timbuktu . 
29016	1	a	that's good enough for me . 
29017	2	a	 . . . and pam was just going crazy , trying to take care of philip because cece has been out of control recently , and- look , andy , it doesn't matter . the truth is , i just feel terrible lying to you . 
29018	0	a	i feel terrible getting lied to . no one's ever lied to me before . 
29019	2	a	okay . i think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth . 
29020	0	a	no , not after what i told dwight about firing you . no . here's what we're going to do . we're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up . have you ever heard of a connecticut cover-up ? 
29021	2	a	no . 
29022	0	a	do you know why you never heard of it ? 
29023	2	a	no . 
29024	0	a	covered it up . 
29025	2	a	are you sure you can keep this under wraps ? 
29026	0	a	they used to call me king tut because i'm so good at keeping things under wraps . 
29027	0	a	my nickname was actually king butt , because i had a king-size butt . 
29028	1	a	okay , everybody , gather 'round . got a real special surprise for you . 
29029	1	a	okay- oh , jim . hey , this guy look familiar ? 
29030	2	a	uh-
29031	2	a	the empanada guy ! 
29032	1	a	no , toby ! damn it , toby ! no , i wasn't asking you . ask him if he remembers jim . 
29033	1	a	he says , 'no ! ' boom ! 
29034	0	a	yeah but who remembers all their customers ? i mean , i can name like three of our clients .

29147	2	a	i would love for everyone to just forgive me . but , if that's not happening , i'm not averse to just buying them all off .

29233	1	a	may i have your attention please ? could kathy , darryl , phyllis , kevin and kelly please join me in the conference room immediately ? 
29234	1	a	oh , no big deal . it's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to tallahassee , florida . 
29235	1	a	oh , i'm sorry stanley , i can't share any more details with you . you see , andy rejected you . 
29236	1	a	i can understand your pain and your rage , but you know what ? andy is an honorable man , let us not question his choices . i'm sure he had his reasons . 
29237	1	a	i know , you and me both , brother . it seemed kinda random to me , but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime . 
29238	1	a	good point . but we're gonna be working pretty hard until five pm . after that it's gonna be beach volleyball , trips to cape canaveral , and sea kayaking with gloria estefan . 
29239	1	a	it might be innate goodness versus innate badness ? but there's an easy way to find out . oh andy , gotta few questions for you . 
29240	0	a	mooshie mooshie . 
29241	1	a	uh , the florida picks got out , and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify ? 
29242	0	a	well uh . . . well the deliberations were confidential so . . . i feel like we should respect that . 
29243	1	a	hey . be proud of your enormous monster baby . i was once an enormous monster baby . 
29244	0	a	guys . guys . guys . come on , seriously ? we cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift , guys !

29250	0	a	wha-
29251	0	a	ok , i did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly , so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to florida , i'm happy to hear you out . 
29252	1	a	great idea ! so why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours , come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to florida and andy and i will listen to it . 
29253	0	a	no . that is a ridiculous waste of time . 
29254	0	a	five to six hours ? 
29255	1	a	three to four hours . 
29256	0	a	no no no no . 
29257	1	a	two to three hours . . .

29261	4	a	ok , read it back to me . 
29262	2	a	 robert , great offer . wish i could hit the links with you in florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets .

29264	2	a	ok , sending . 
29265	4	a	well done . and we managed to kill the entire morning . 
29266	2	a	really did he responded l-o-l . 
29267	1	a	i have already picked my team: darryl , oscar , angela , phyllis and toby and that is the team that i am taking . what's that ? it's not up to me ? i only have influence ? well , that's all baltzer gladfielder had and no one eats owls for thanksgiving .

29278	0	a	erin , you wanna go to tallahassee ? 
29279	1	a	you know i don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already . i think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality . 
29280	0	a	well it wouldn't be hard to find someone to fill in . . 
29281	2	a	now , is it too dark to say that cici's having an operation ? 
29282	4	a	i think you need to go to florida . 
29283	2	a	i think you're right . 
29284	4	a	it's only for three weeks , you know with my mom and sister at the house it'll be . . 
29285	2	a	total nightmare .

29290	0	a	tuns , i'm really sorry . you're too essential to the operation here , i can't let you go . 
29291	1	a	i wouldn't say that . . . it's a bit much . 
29292	2	a	you know dwight , if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell andy that i actually am essential to the operation . that way i couldn't go . 
29293	1	a	jim is essential to th-
29294	2	a	hold on , just wanna get it on camera .

29658	0	a	what if you're being attacked by a 4'11' man who is penisless ? 
29659	0	a	why don't we start with the basics ? show us how to defend ourselves against a baby , and then like , a fifth grade girl , and then , you know , if we have time , on up to a scary man . 
29660	0	a	so in that scenario , what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face ? what can the attacker then do to better protect himself ?

29708	1	a	it's true . 
29709	2	a	this . . . is the future , because . . . this is the past . i've been through a lot of issues in my life . i've seen drug addiction -- unemployment . i've been in a relationship that tore my heart apart , without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain .

29725	0	a	yeah . that was him on the phone . he sounds wonderful . 
29726	0	a	how could i have been more clear ? he had a massive stroke of good fortune and he is now in a better place . 
29727	0	a	i think that dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure . 
29728	0	a	yeah , i know , oscar we all are but nobody's gonna open it . you'd have to be insane . 
29729	0	a	 now , carefully . . . open the box .

29731	1	a	 a dart ? are you kidding me ? who would put a poison dart , well , i mean , i don't know that it's poison . i mean , i just have to imagine . god , i'm glad he's ok though . kinda sounds like he deserved it , opening another man's treasure and all . wow ! 
29732	1	a	 well , mister ball , it's been a pleasure . now , give my regards to hell . da ! 
29733	1	a	ah !

29738	2	a	this is the last time i'll ever see dwight . it's a weird feeling , it's , um , what's the word ? it's not , it's not bittersweet . it's uh . . . sweet . yeah . 
29739	0	a	would if i could . and i can so i will . put me down for one box . don't care what it is , dealer's choice . 
29740	0	a	damn it . 
29741	2	a	 all right . so . . . i guess this is it . 
29742	1	a	well , jim , i just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times , i've even hated your guts . but . . . bye , bye . i win . 
29743	2	a	 goodbye , dwight . 
29744	1	a	 robert , race you to the clubhouse , gentlemen's bet . woohoo ! 
29745	2	a	well , he's florida's problem now . 
29746	2	a	what's that ? 
29747	2	a	i thought you liked the store ? 
29748	2	a	thank you . 
29749	2	a	wow . when you put it that way , i guess it does sound pretty terrible . 
29750	1	a	 robert ! i'm gonna win , ha ha , i'm the gentleman ! suck it ! 
29751	1	a	 the math is simple folks . deeper market penetration , plus greater visibility , will raise sabre to the power of two . 
29752	1	a	 i told you . 
29753	1	a	you know what ? that is a great idea . cathy , write that down and print it out . it's gonna make some really good toilet paper . 
29754	2	a	 all right . there he is . 
29755	1	a	what are you doing here ? i thought i got rid of you ? 
29756	2	a	can i just talk to you for one quick second ? 
29757	1	a	what , your stylist ran out of 'messy spray' ? 
29758	2	a	um , actually it's , it's for your own good . i think maybe we should- 
29759	1	a	you want to do something for my own good ? turn around , walk out that door , do not stop 'til you get to scranton , find my cell phone charger , mail it back to me , and then go hell . 
29760	1	a	 silence . 
29761	1	a	 i know what you're trying to do , i don't want it . but your face does look like the guy from operation . 
29762	1	a	different guy . 
29763	2	a	you know , i just think you should know that-
29764	1	a	 that you look like the world's tallest hobbit . 
29765	2	a	well , i tried . you saw it , so , it's on the record . i have a plane to catch .

29768	4	a	 he said , 'i did like dwight' ? he's gonna fire him . 
29769	2	a	no , no , i think it was more like , 'you know , i liked him , but i don't anymore because he did a bad job , so i'm definitely gonna yell at him' . 
29770	4	a	robert doesn't talk like that . you have to stop dwight from doing this . 
29771	2	a	i tried . he will not listen . 
29772	4	a	did you actually try your hardest ? 
29773	2	a	yes . . . my pretty hardest . look , you haven't dealt with him in awhile , all right . he's like super dwight . it's like he's been bitten by a radioactive dwight , or som- stanley , back me up . 
29774	2	a	stanley's very upset that we're leaving florida . but he would back me up . 
29775	4	a	if dwight's about to get fired , you have to tell him . just get the words out . that's all you can do . 
29776	2	a	ok . all right . 
29777	4	a	or have them sing that song ! that the frog does in looney tunes . 
29778	0	a	no . 
29779	0	a	i don't buy it . it , that is a freckle . that is not a tan , ok ? i'm gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here . i want you looking totally 'puerto ricania' when i see you . 
29780	0	a	what ? 
29781	0	a	yeah , that's awesome . that's great . 
29782	1	a	 showtime .

29785	2	a	ok , great , listen to me . listen to me . no , no , i know . will you just let me tell you one thing , please ? 
29786	1	a	yes , you may tell me one thing . wait , you want to borrow money ? 
29787	2	a	listen to me . robert is going to veto the sabre store . 
29788	1	a	 jim , come on . 
29789	2	a	dwight , he's gonna kill the store . 
29790	1	a	uh-huh . 
29791	2	a	and then , i'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it . 
29792	1	a	wait . he's gonna kill the store ? and he's gonna fire me ? 
29793	2	a	yes . 
29794	1	a	 that's two things . 
29795	2	a	dwight , please . 
29796	1	a	nice try , jim . your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today . 
29797	2	a	ok , first of all , they've mostly worked , so-
29798	1	a	you know what ? you might want to get to the airport . it's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products . bye . 
29799	2	a	dwight , come o-
29800	1	a	nothing is gonna stop me . that is the mark of a great man . unstoppability . dunder-mifflin , the farm , mose , all those things vanish in my rearview mirror . now , if you'll excuse me , i have a date with destiny . and from what i hear , she's a slu- ah !

29869	0	a	hm ? 
29870	2	a	i think it's a cross between dumbo and jumbo , with a hint of chubby . it's not a name . 
29871	4	a	robert , is nellie our new manager ? 
29872	4	a	how can you give us performance reviews if you don't know us ? 
29873	0	a	well , we're not really dating anymore , so . . . basically , i mean , i just have to cross a few ts and dot a few i's , you know . 
29874	0	a	all right . technically , yes , i am still technically dating jessica . but when i realized that i wanted you back , i just jumped in the car and i drove down here , and i didn't want to stop until i saw you . 
29875	2	a	any luck ? 
29876	4	a	no . he just keeps letting all the calls go to voicemail . 
29877	0	a	 please leave a message for andy bernard , include your na-
29878	0	a	nope . it's just work . not important . you know , i can really feel this is my quads , i can tell i'm getting stronger . 
29879	0	a	i don't know . just let it vibrate . it's fine . 
29880	0	a	i don't think it does that . 
29881	2	a	 andy ? 
29882	0	a	jim ? 
29883	2	a	andy , where are you ? 
29884	0	a	i- i'm home in bed . i've been in bed all day . i got the-- i got the serious poops , man . 
29885	2	a	what ? you're in florida ? andy , nellie bertram's trying to take your job . 
29886	0	a	what do you mean , take my job ? 
29887	2	a	like , set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager . 
29888	0	a	okay . . . jim , i really appreciate you looking out for me , but i'm not coming home without erin . so i'll talk to you later . 
29889	2	a	guys , we cannot do these performance reviews , okay ? if we go into them , you're basically accepting nellie as your manager , and trust me , you do not want her as your manager . 
29890	4	a	i like working here . 
29891	2	a	dwight , should she be our manager ? 
29892	1	a	i wouldn't let her manage a celery farm . 
29893	1	a	those who can't farm , farm celery . 
29894	2	a	and when was the last time dwight and i agreed on anything ever ? 
29895	1	a	i refuse to be judged by someone that i do not respect . i lost respect for you in florida . if it was up to me , you would be in jail forever . 
29896	1	a	what ? 
29897	1	a	there's no limit to what i think i deserve . 
29898	1	a	five percent . no less . 
29899	1	a	six percent , i know my worth . 
29900	2	a	the raise isn't real . 
29901	1	a	money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard . 
29902	4	a	phyllis . 
29903	2	a	um . . . are you aware that nellie is giving out raises ? 
29904	2	a	yeah . she gave one to dwight , phyllis . 
29905	2	a	land . world . uh , it's not that i don't want a-- well , yes , i guess i'd take a raise . that's not what i'm saying . that's not-- sorry . 
29906	2	a	yes . 
29907	2	a	oh , god , nature , please . 
29908	2	a	was that not the--
29909	2	a	mm-hm . 
29910	2	a	was that it ? no , that wasn't bad . 
29911	2	a	no . i would've said no . 
29912	2	a	i mean , if we go in there and take these raises , what are we saying ? that it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job ? shouldn't work like that . 
29913	1	a	no , you know what ? nellie's right . that is exactly how it should work . darryl , this office is mine now . 
29914	1	a	yes . 
29915	1	a	yes . 
29916	1	a	yes . 
29917	1	a	yes . 
29918	1	a	yes . yes , sorry too late . i'm here . this is mine . back off . 
29919	1	a	 ow ! ow , ow , ow . ow , ow , ow , ow . 
29920	1	a	 well fought . i accept the outcome . 
29921	0	a	yeah , if i had my own--
29922	0	a	--sorry , you go . 
29923	0	a	well , i was just going to say that , if i had my own fountain , it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other's mouth . it's just stupid . what were you going to say ? 
29924	0	a	you broke my heart too . 
29925	0	a	i'm so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time . 
29926	4	a	really ? okay , well , um , i like consistency in the manager's position , no weird silent coups . stuff like that . i'm easy . 
29927	4	a	whoa , that's kind of condescending . would you say something like that to jim ? 
29928	4	a	well , i mean , the only reason he doesn't is because i'm breastfeeding , and phillip doesn't like a bottle . 
29929	4	a	no . 
29930	4	a	i think . . . you're a witch . 
29931	4	a	 i'm amazing . 
29932	2	a	no , it's not , because you don't really work here . 
29933	2	a	yeah , that's the thing . i don't know if you can even give raises . 
29934	2	a	yes . 
29935	2	a	no . 
29936	2	a	she dies . 
29937	2	a	let's see it . show of hands . 
29938	2	a	all right , guys , stop . 
29939	2	a	how ? 
29940	0	a	that did not go how i wanted it to . ugh . i have a whole ton of erin's favorite food for the drive back , eggplant parm . it's biodegradable . animals will eat it . 
29941	0	a	erin ! 
29942	0	a	okay . 
29943	0	a	wait , we have to go back and get your stuff . 
29944	0	a	like your toothbrush and stuff . 
29945	0	a	you don't have a toothbrush ? 
29946	0	a	how do you not have a toothbrush ? 
29947	0	a	you just use whichever one is sitting there ? 
29948	0	a	of course . i own my toothbrush . 
29949	4	a	hey jim . stanley's back from the hospital today . can you sign his card ? 
29950	2	a	oh , great . 'glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy . ' oh that's not good . 
29951	4	a	it's nice . it's funny . it mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache . 
29952	2	a	stanley doesn't have a moustache . 
29953	4	a	yeah he does . 
29954	4	a	okay , phyllis sits across from him every day . phyllis , does he have a moustache or not ? 
29955	4	a	phyllis ! what are you talking- the whole card depends on this ! 
29956	2	a	okay , the man's worked here for 25 years . how can none of us picture his face ? 
29957	4	a	okay , which one of these looks more right ? 
29958	1	a	neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity . that said , the one on the left . 
29959	2	a	okay , quick . who says moustache ? 
29960	1	a	yep . 
29961	2	a	who says no moustache ? 
29962	1	a	yes ! 
29963	4	a	welcome back , stanley . 
29964	4	a	oh ! 
29965	4	a	um , no , i was just , um , just having a cup of coffee , kind of warming up for the day . 
29966	1	a	okay , okay . 
29967	1	a	why jim ? 
29968	4	a	i'm sorry , we're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible ? 
29969	2	a	i'm sorry , we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment . 
29970	4	a	i'm still not sure why this woman is even here . 
29971	2	a	why is she here ? 
29972	0	a	 two crazy kids on the journey of life . 
29973	0	a	on the road with my new girlfriend . but first , a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents' cabin in southern pennsylvania . 
29974	0	a	mm-hmm . it's a beautiful place . great place to let her down easy . 
29975	0	a	oh . hmm . 
29976	0	a	 time to have a little kiss ! 
29977	0	a	mm . sorry . right . no kisses till the breakup is official . 
29978	0	a	i believe in that . 
29979	0	a	i think that's important . that is important . bummer , but important . 
29980	0	a	mm-hmm . 
29981	4	a	i know , right ? 
29982	4	a	phyllis ! 
29983	0	a	 . . . and jessica , just so you know , this is way more about my love for erin than anything wrong with you . 
29984	0	a	consider it nailed . 
29985	0	a	okay , here we go . jessica , i'm really sorry . i just need you to know-
29986	0	a	i just need you to know-
29987	1	a	 ugh ! ow . 
29988	2	a	nellie , that reminds me . do you want this chair in the bedroom ? 'cause to be honest , i don't think it's gonna fit through the door . 
29989	1	a	don't listen to jim . have you ever seen him play tetris ? 'oh , i think i'll just use this line horizontally . oh , i had no idea what a gift this line is . '
29990	2	a	that was one time-
29991	1	a	i will get the chair in . watch the great schrutini work his magic . 
29992	2	a	 excuse me , one second . hi . 
29993	4	a	hey , what's up ? 
29994	2	a	ah , nothing , just hauling some cube with dwight . 
29995	1	a	 haulin' cube ! 
29996	2	a	that's moving boxes . we just came up with the term to make it sound cooler . 
29997	4	a	so we're planning this party for nellie , and we're gonna make it really bad . 
29998	2	a	sounds like every other party . 
29999	4	a	no . we're gonna make it like a prank . like order bad food , give her this passive-aggressive card . 
30000	2	a	oh ! hire a magician . 
30001	4	a	what ? 
30002	2	a	trust me . 
30003	4	a	 okay . 
30004	0	a	wow . there's a lot of cars here . this is just weird . 
30005	0	a	hey , lauren . look at you . 
30006	0	a	i was just on my way back from this business trip , thought i'd stop and say hi to jessica . 
30007	0	a	why is erin with me ? that's a great question . she is my coworker , and she needed a ride because she totaled her car . 
30008	0	a	yep . this is erin . 
30009	0	a	yeah . uh , you know , we had such a quick window to make this work , i think we should probably just-
30010	1	a	i wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in england . i really should have a tweeter account . 
30011	2	a	yes , you should . 
30012	1	a	 ooh . 
30013	2	a	 'nellie , don't open , stupid . love , nellie . '
30014	1	a	i have to see these shoes . 
30015	2	a	i doubt that they're sh-
30016	1	a	oh ! 
30017	2	a	whoa . who is this guy ? 
30018	1	a	here's the two of them taking a hike . i'm guessing he's some kind of friend . 
30019	2	a	boyfriend . 
30020	1	a	here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the eiffel tower . i'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend . 
30021	2	a	like a boyfriend ? 
30022	1	a	you read my mind . 
30023	2	a	yeah . whoa . here's one with his face whited out . 
30024	1	a	hmm . maybe someone threw a pie in his face . new theory- he's a hated italian politician . 
30025	2	a	better theory . this is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup . 
30026	2	a	oh , nellie . i'm so sorry . we were just . . . 
30027	1	a	why not call . . . 
30028	2	a	shh ! 
30029	1	a	that's awful . what kind of restaurant . 
30030	2	a	dwight ! 
30031	2	a	i'm so sorry . these must be very painful memories . 
30032	1	a	if it would help you to forget , i could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick . 
30033	2	a	no , no . of course . just one quick question . was this um , halloween , or . . . 
30034	2	a	 you know what , pam ? i was thinking maybe we should change course here . let's give up on all this mean stuff . 
30035	4	a	what ? no ! no , i just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it . you don't have a copyright on pranks . i might be better at this than you . 
30036	2	a	no , that's not what i-
30037	2	a	absolutely . yeah . call it off , pam . call it off , okay ? it's way more complicated than you think . cancel the magician . trust me . 
30038	4	a	oh , okay . okay , i will . 
30039	4	a	or what if . . . 
30040	4	a	we discuss . . . the idea of doing the party totally normal . like , not mean . just a regular party . not mean . 
30041	4	a	what are you talking about ? yes we can . 
30042	0	a	it'll be fine . just act natural . do you want a gummy penis ? 
30043	0	a	these are delicious . 
30044	0	a	ew ! aww ! that seems gross at first blush , right ? but relationships are always more complicated than you think . i mean , we don't know matthew's history with this other woman . maybe she saved his life . i don't know . i just- i don't think we should rush to judgment about matthew . maybe we don't pop that one . 
30045	0	a	hey . 
30046	0	a	oh ! ah , megan . 
30047	0	a	aww . 
30048	0	a	oh , he's out there . 
30049	0	a	well , you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling , so . . . 
30050	0	a	 by yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes . . . 
30051	4	a	okay , they're almost here- what ? come on . if you guys are gonna be mean , could you at least be subtle ? 
30052	4	a	no , that's a great idea . let's have a code name . how about mondays ? i hate mondays ? mondays are the worst ? 
30053	4	a	cause there's someone already here named pam . 
30054	0	a	no . i gotta do this . hey jessica , could i talk to you ? 
30055	0	a	uh , maybe we could talk in private ? 
30056	0	a	well , first just let me say that i hope when i'm done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends . 
30057	0	a	uh , no . no . you always do this . you twist my words around . part of me thinks we should just end this right now . 
30058	0	a	whoa ! that ? no . okay . you want honesty ? super-honesty time . i'm gay . 
30059	0	a	i am gay , and i prefer men . 
30060	0	a	you did not , kenny ! 
30061	0	a	i like hanging out with you . you're a cool guy . which proves my point . that i'm gay . 
30062	0	a	well , i was faking it . i had to fake it every time . i had to imagine that i was in a steam room with john stamos . 
30063	0	a	well . . . i mean , i was good at hiding it , but-
30064	0	a	understandable . and i'm really sorry . i really am . so . . . we should probably . . . go . 
30065	2	a	oh . well . i feel that as someone who knows pam only a little bit . . . enough . a good amount . not the most , though . i would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with . 
30066	2	a	no . no . 
30067	4	a	oh ! 
30068	0	a	right ? rough scene . 
30069	0	a	oh . . . at least we can kiss now . 
30070	0	a	you know , that stuff that i said about you to her . . . i did- that's just- i had to say it . you know , i was dating her at the time . 
30071	0	a	yeah . 
30072	0	a	oh yeah . 
30073	2	a	oh , i'll do it . i will volunteer . 
30074	2	a	i'll do it . 
30075	2	a	 it's the four of hearts . 
30076	2	a	not true . 'cause that's not a real place . 
30077	4	a	that's not a real knot . when you pull on it , it disappears . 
30078	1	a	okay scram , wizard . 
30079	1	a	you heard me ! 
30080	0	a	i just gotta do one thing . 
30081	0	a	hi . super-duper honesty time . i'm not gay . in fact , i'm so not gay , i'm in love with a girl . her name is erin hannon and she's right there . she's sweet , funny and beautiful and total relationship material . 
30082	0	a	okay . 
30083	0	a	bye guys . 
30084	4	a	hey hank . 
30085	4	a	i thought i was very specific about you not letting up a magician . 
30086	2	a	well , turns out he actually made it up there . 
30087	4	a	yeah , he came and went . 
30088	4	a	let's just- let's go . 
30089	2	a	night-night . 
30090	2	a	phyllis says the same twelve clich��s every time it rains . so , i promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today , i will send out for hot chocolates . 
30091	4	a	just one . 'this weather makes me want to stay at home , curled up with a good book . '
30092	4	a	you know , like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain ? 
30093	2	a	hey , come on . 
30094	2	a	and that's noon . exactly . 
30095	0	a	 my girlfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble-
30096	0	a	 . . . my girlfriend's back ! 
30097	0	a	anyway , i know it's the end of the day . we just wanted to stop by and say hi . 
30098	0	a	hey , kev . 
30099	0	a	nice sweater . 
30100	0	a	what happened to old salty ? 
30101	1	a	nellie let me bobble-ize him . his name is now captain mutato . 
30102	1	a	i've written quite a bit of x-men fan fiction . captain mutato is half man , half mermaid . so he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid . most of my writing involves the latter . 
30103	0	a	okey dokey . 
30104	0	a	whoa . well , you must be the famous nellie bertram i've been hearing all about . i am the famous andy bernard you've been hearing all about . 
30105	0	a	i just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence . 
30106	0	a	anyway , now that i'm back , i would love to have my office back , whenever you get a chance . 
30107	0	a	obviously , we'll figure out the , uh , logistics of moving all this stuff out of here . but , you know , the sooner the better . 
30108	0	a	get back to normalcy . 
30109	4	a	oh my gosh , thank you so much . but seriously , we don't want to bother you any more than we already have . 
30110	2	a	that's it . 
30111	4	a	ravi , our amazing pediatrician , was asking us if we knew any girls and i said i know the perfect girl . 
30112	2	a	yep . because kelly is indian and . . . oh , that's it . 
30113	4	a	race had nothing to do with it . i just knew they'd be good together . 
30114	4	a	 kelly has been a handful in the past . 
30115	4	a	 but she's had a bad influence . she's like an addict . and i just had to get her clean . 
30116	2	a	sorry , just to be clear , you're saying do not shake the baby . 
30117	4	a	don't shake our baby ? 
30118	4	a	okay . i'd never heard that before . so , thank you . 
30119	4	a	yeah , i'm glad you said something . 
30120	4	a	yeah , they're really great together . 
30121	2	a	that's about it , yeah . 
30122	0	a	this is what i was trying to tell you . 
30123	0	a	 okay . 
30124	0	a	you can't dock my pay-
30125	0	a	great . five , four , three , two , one . angela , please dock nellie's pay a hundred dollars . angela ? 
30126	0	a	angela ? 
30127	0	a	ooh , she's counting again . 
30128	0	a	oh , oh ! 
30129	0	a	seriously , angela ? 
30130	0	a	i got a little bit of an anger problem . got me in some trouble a couple years ago . 
30131	0	a	you're just saying numbers . it's meaningless . 
30132	0	a	it's literally like-
30133	0	a	oh , yeah , i was just tired . 
30134	0	a	whoa . no . are you kidding ? you were so sexy . just the thought of you last night , like , crazy turns me on . it just didn't last night . 
30135	0	a	yeah . i know it's not . . . a big deal . 
30136	1	a	yes ? 
30137	1	a	how ? 
30138	1	a	erin , i am so glad that you trusted me . you came to the exact right person for this . no , i have never once experienced anything remotely like that . never . 
30139	1	a	okay ? 
30140	1	a	washington monument . 
30141	1	a	eiffel tower . 
30142	4	a	i saw you were getting along with ryan again . 
30143	4	a	yeah , he's so great . remember how it felt when he cheated on you though ? 
30144	4	a	i am not going to let kelly throw her life away on ryan . and it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician . why you would even ask or were going to ask , because i- i felt like that question was coming . 
30145	1	a	one of toby's eyes is getting smaller . so there's that . gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and meredith said she was interested and then gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket . so i'll keep you posted on that . 
30146	1	a	every day i brief nellie on what's going on in the office . most of it's irrelevant . but a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on . 
30147	1	a	oh , and andy lost his masculinity , so congratulations on that . 
30148	1	a	erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night . by contrast , i went to sleep with an erection so large it was like i was wearing no blanket at all . wow , i knew you'd win , but you just demolished him ! i'm a little bit jealous , actually . reduced him to a mere ant . 
30149	0	a	you can't call a meeting . but i would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now ! so let's get in the conference room . thank you . good . thank you for coming to my meeting . 
30150	0	a	oh ! can't do it 'cause i gotta run a meeting . so . 
30151	0	a	wanted to talk to all of you guys about importance . . . and know that each and every one of you is vitally important . 
30152	1	a	it's not just a human problem . flounders frequently experience impotence , especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male . 
30153	1	a	no , no , no , no , no , it's not me . i'm gonna prove it right here and now . 
30154	0	a	fine , it was me . i couldn't- i had a problem with erin last night . happy ? 
30155	0	a	i had a lot on my mind last night . and i didn't perform . okay ? it happens to plenty of guys . it's usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview . 
30156	0	a	every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction . tuna ? t-dog ? 
30157	2	a	um . . . 
30158	0	a	fascinating .

30163	2	a	couple of times . 
30164	1	a	yeah jim . 
30165	0	a	yeah jim , get it out there . 
30166	2	a	um . . . i don't . . . uh , yes , that time that it was very late . uh , we'd had sex so many times already , i was exhausted . . . 
30167	4	a	okay , stop . 
30168	2	a	i was very drunk . 
30169	1	a	you know , my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but i could let you rent it . 
30170	2	a	wow , what are we talking about ? 
30171	0	a	 dad , don't think of it as a demotion . just think of it as a promotion to a lower level . i don't think you have to tell your friends anything . it hasn't been decided yet . 
30172	0	a	oh , and another thing ! our sex life is none of your businesses ! 
30173	0	a	stop protecting me ! i'm a man- i can protect myself ! this is misdirected anger and i'm sorry ! i don't mean to lash out at you ! there's a lot coming up right now , all at once ! dad go to hell , i'm taller than you ! 
30174	0	a	you are not the manager . i earned that job . i was personally chosen after robert was chosen and quit . 
30175	0	a	why don't you take a seat , you idiot ? 
30176	0	a	and your stupid face ! and your stupid office ! ah ! 
30177	0	a	that would actually be cool . i'd love for you to meet some of the guys . 
30178	4	a	all i did was remind her that you used to treat her badly . 
30179	4	a	fair enough . um . . . i don't think you're a very good person . and forgive me , but i feel like i've said this to you before: i don't like you very much . 
30180	4	a	oh , no , no , no . 
30181	4	a	read it , please . i love amazing poetry . 
30182	4	a	read through the pain . be strong .

30194	0	a	no . 
30195	0	a	i can't describe it . i just , for the first time in a long time , i actually feel in control . i feel . . . alive . 
30196	0	a	ah- da , da , da , da . i got it . 
30197	0	a	i . . . got . . . it . 
30198	0	a	yes . 
30199	4	a	you're not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from ryan's soul ? 
30200	2	a	not at all , can we go ? 
30201	4	a	kapoor and ka-desperate , he watches . '
30202	2	a	second line . 
30203	4	a	he is a drifter out to sea . '
30204	2	a	and when the indian ocean calms , one speck of white remains in waters cold and kelly green . '
30205	4	a	it's just so dumb . but when he describes himself as a child , lost on the life raft . . . 
30206	2	a	uh , ryan can never know . 
30207	4	a	okay fine . ryan , something the matter ? 
30208	4	a	smokey , the bear ? 
30209	2	a	wow that's terrible , i really liked him . 
30210	2	a	well , i second that emotion . 
30211	4	a	no , no , no , 'tracks of my tears' and what else ? what are some more ? what's one more ? 
30212	4	a	i don't think you love smokey robinson . i think you're just doing all of this to prove how deep you are about music
30213	1	a	you don't like the beatles ? 
30214	1	a	eleanor rigby ? paperback writer ? 
30215	2	a	wow ! look at that ! it says he's actually playing state college . that's only three hours away ! 
30216	4	a	oh my god , ryan ! that's perfect ! you have to go ! 
30217	2	a	tickets are 250 bucks . 
30218	4	a	250 dollars is nothing to the world's biggest smokey robinson fan . 
30219	2	a	paul anka . 
30220	2	a	okay , you could just show up late though . 
30221	4	a	tears of a clown ! 
30222	1	a	i don't want to alarm people , but there is a distinct chance that we are all about to be killed
30223	2	a	well , as long as you don't want to alarm people . . . 
30224	1	a	there is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot . 
30225	1	a	that's how workplace tragedies always begin . a middle aged white male 'hanging out' . call the cops ! 
30226	4	a	dwight , i don't think he's going to hurt anybody . 
30227	1	a	i don't even know what kind of weapon he has . could be a knife , could be a gun . could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel . i'm going up to the roof . and i'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case . 
30228	0	a	hey !

30237	1	a	you guess the price , you win the prize . have you never been to a quaker fair before ? god ! 
30238	0	a	what haven't i been doing ? gosh , just today i was working on this rock opera that i'm writing , though it feels more like i'm receiving it than writing it . 
30239	2	a	wow , that's exciting ! but until you firm up the idea , you might want to keep it between us . 
30240	0	a	the hero lives in this dystopian future and he flies around in a spaceship that's shaped like a treble clef . and he has to sing his heart out to destroy all evil . 
30241	4	a	sounds like you're doing alright . 
30242	0	a	ehh , a little better than alright , actually . really good ! 
30243	0	a	bobby ! bobbo ! you're a rock opera guy , right ? you like rock operas ? 
30244	0	a	you gotta check out this thing i'm working on , it's really cool . there's this character thomas oregon , and he wants to destroy all the guitars in the world because he realizes that music is the one thing he can't control . 
30245	0	a	evil ! although he's humanized in the end because he weeps uncontrolably and pees in his pants .

30597	4	a	and he wanted jim to be a part of it too .

30605	2	a	no , pete is not the new jim . the only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on meredith's face . and if that makes him the new jim , then every human being in the world is the new jim .

31402	0	a	no . no ! nooo ! 
31403	1	a	 dwight schrute . well , hi there david wallace . why would you ever call me when the manager is out of town ? 
31404	1	a	and you didn't call jim - that seems significant . 
31405	2	a	hi , david . 
31406	1	a	no , he shouldn't . 
31407	2	a	 go ahead david , i'm listening . 
31408	1	a	okay , david , i want to take you off speaker but . . . i don't know where i'd put you . 
31409	1	a	the white pages . 
31410	1	a	the white pages: do you want it ? no . do you use it ? no . does it inexplicably show up on your doorstep three times a year ? yes , yes , and yes . there's a reason that we in the paper industry call this thing 'the white whale' . look at all that sweet blubber . 
31411	1	a	i'm gonna need to put you on hold for a second . hah ! yah ! woooo ! eat it jim ! eat it phyllis ! eat . . . where's stanley ? 
31412	1	a	will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it ? 
31413	1	a	yeah ! okay . hey david , i'm back . 
31414	1	a	so uh , last i remember tom peterman was in charge of that account ? 
31415	1	a	her name ? 
31416	1	a	shhh ! thanks david ! thank you so much for calling me ! 
31417	1	a	good luck to you . 
31418	1	a	that is a damnable lie . i love women . 
31419	1	a	'gy-na' said that ? 
31420	4	a	can you go instead ? 
31421	2	a	i can't . i have the thing . 
31422	2	a	i have this conference call today with this company in philly that i'm helping start . ah , first board meeting . also , the first time i've ever been excited about work . so , that feels . . . wrong . 
31423	1	a	okay . with pleasure . get ready to learn a few new tricks , old dog . 
31424	4	a	you've got this schrute . 
31425	1	a	hello . 
31426	1	a	may i please speak to your boss ? 
31427	1	a	okay , this isn't working for me , 'cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss . 
31428	4	a	oh , i'll be the buyer . 
31429	4	a	hello , mr . schrute , nice to see you . please have a seat . 
31430	1	a	i never sit down during sales meetings . i want to appear aggressive and imposing . i am going to sell to you in twelve minutes
31431	1	a	i will tell her what her needs are and then fill them . so this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing . and once i'm finished , it's over . 
31432	4	a	okay , let's stop here . anyone have any thoughts ? 
31433	1	a	i thought it went great . 
31434	2	a	yeah , i'm here . are we all on ? 
31435	2	a	 right . okay , uh , over the next three months . . . 
31436	2	a	i uh , i have some ideas , actually . . . 
31437	2	a	 uh yeah . trust me , i'd rather be with you guys . 
31438	2	a	oh , sorry , i uh . . . was just saying that we should uh . . . 
31439	2	a	 um , you know what ? i . . should have just had . . . i should have just had you call me on my cell . 
31440	2	a	i'm gonna try a different spot . okay ? 
31441	2	a	okay , i'll call you right back . 
31442	4	a	okay , when you're selling to women , it is crucial that you listen , dwight . also you want to respect their . . . are you listening now ? 
31443	1	a	yes . 
31444	4	a	okay , well you have to show us . 
31445	1	a	that's impossible . listening happens in the ear and in the brain . i mean , some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately , our external hairs don't vibrate at all . 
31446	4	a	huh . uh huh . 
31447	1	a	what are you doing ? 
31448	4	a	a little smile and a nod shows that i hear you . got it ? 
31449	1	a	kind of . 
31450	4	a	nellie , why don't you tell dwight what we were doing earlier today . and dwight , you show us that you're listening . 
31451	1	a	i am a person . 
31452	1	a	that's a bit extreme . 
31453	1	a	okay , i'm a woman . i'm a woman . good ? 
31454	1	a	hello . 
31455	1	a	thank you . i'm so proud of them . i carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina . 
31456	4	a	ten years ago , i didn't care if dwight got married or died a beet-farming bachelor . but having kids makes you so soft . i used to watch pulp fiction and laugh , and now i'm like , that poor gimp is somebody's child . 
31457	4	a	you know , i think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women . 
31458	1	a	look , i have no problem with women . it's businesswomen and their , their power suits and their shoulder pads . don't lie about your shoulders ! 
31459	4	a	dwight , listen to me . businesswomen are just normal , nice , reasonable people . who is a nice , reasonable person in your experience ? 
31460	1	a	i had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently . 
31461	4	a	okay , so , when you're selling to this woman , just imagine that she's that nice , reasonable barber . 
31462	1	a	okay , i can do that . 
31463	4	a	mm-hmm . good . baby steps . 
31464	1	a	he used to fight dogs . 
31465	4	a	like , he used to make dogs fight ? or he actually fought dogs ? 
31466	1	a	little of this , little of that . 
31467	2	a	what i was saying is the genius of air jordan was not in the market saturation , it was in --
31468	2	a	the . . . the . . . the . . . what i was saying is the real genius was . . . was in the . . . 
31469	2	a	it was , uh in the authentic design , right ? so i mean , you really felt like michael jordan was wearing these shoes , so . . . 
31470	2	a	nobody ! 
31471	2	a	no , no , no . 
31472	4	a	oh , great . oh , i'm sorry . do you mind telling me her name ? i realized we don't have it . 
31473	4	a	okay , great . 
31474	1	a	 just a little off the top and then a nice combing . yeah , just comb it . 
31475	4	a	oh my god . it's jan . 
31476	1	a	oh , dear god in heaven . 
31477	4	a	jan used to be one of my superiors , and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people i have ever met . 
31478	4	a	jim and i are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant hunter . he was 17 . but she looks great . if she asks , will you tell her i said that ? 
31479	4	a	forget everything we taught you . hey , jan ! it's so great to see you . 
31480	4	a	what ? 
31481	1	a	hey . your daughter could be a bubble bath model . i could just bite her head off . 
31482	4	a	sorry . um , david is in vermont . did you speak with him ? he sent dwight instead . 
31483	1	a	listening . 
31484	1	a	sorry . 
31485	1	a	okay . 
31486	4	a	so this was all just a trick . you don't really have any business to give ? 
31487	4	a	but not to us . 
31488	4	a	you did good , dwight . it's okay . i mean , seriously , jan's not normal . let's just go . she's not going to sell to us . 
31489	1	a	yes , she is . now , i may not have any instincts with women , but i have an instinct for sales . you keep her occupied . i'll be right back . 
31490	4	a	what ? 
31491	4	a	yeah . 
31492	4	a	yeah . um , do you have any other pictures of astrid ? 
31493	4	a	wow . your voice is as lovely as ever . 
31494	4	a	and it is so cute how she signs her name . 
31495	4	a	oh , okay . it's just that's how cece does it with the backwards 'e's . 
31496	4	a	oh , actually she can . 
31497	4	a	of course . 
31498	4	a	um . . . 'a' . . . 'x' ? i don't -- you got me . 
31499	4	a	 i'm so sorry . i hate this . you're better . 
31500	4	a	mm . excuse me . could i get some more water ? 
31501	1	a	jan . . . you thought i had no more cards left to play . well i've got one . man-boy ! the ace of babes . 
31502	4	a	oh , my god . 
31503	1	a	you're the quizno's . jan , may i introduce to you your own personal dunder mifflin liaison , devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction . i sensed that molly wasn't quite meeting your needs -- nothing like , uh , your old assistant . . . hunter . was that his name ? 
31504	1	a	hmm ? 
31505	4	a	okay , you do not have to do this . 
31506	1	a	he's been growing that mustache for weeks . best he can do . . . so young . 
31507	1	a	very good . 
31508	2	a	jim halpert . 
31509	2	a	hey man . i am so sorry about that . 
31510	2	a	yeah . no , i know . this whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal . but don't worry . i'll figure it out . 
31511	2	a	uh , what does -- what does that mean ? 
31512	4	a	oh , hey , molly . you should just quit . 
31513	1	a	oh and uh , molly . . . i know it can't be easy working for jan . good luck with your feelings . 
31514	4	a	dwight , that was really nice . you should ask for her number . 
31515	1	a	oh , i got her number . 415-ycl . 
31516	4	a	that's a license number ? 
31517	1	a	that's all you need . and when i have curried favor with her , i will let you know . 
31518	4	a	oh . why me ? 
31519	1	a	because you are my friend and you are a woman . . . and women love gossip . it's like air to you people . ugh , god .

31524	2	a	what ? yeah , right . as if . 
31525	2	a	today i will be asking david wallace if i can start working part-time , because the sports marketing company that i started really needs me to be there . 
31526	4	a	last week jim wasn't there , and they named the company athlead . 
31527	2	a	i could have prevented that . so i have to talk to wallace . 
31528	4	a	tell them your opening line . 
31529	2	a	 hey david , how would you like a guy who's not here as much , gets paid the same amount of salary , and has bigger fish to fry in philadelphia ?

31547	2	a	how about this-- you let me take you to lunch , and i make my case ? 
31548	2	a	all right . 
31549	1	a	get in the van . 
31550	1	a	well , this documentary crew has been following our every move for the past nine years , but i don't see them so i think we're good . 
31551	1	a	 does he own a gun ? show her . 
31552	1	a	do you have any idea how many guns trevor's had stolen from him ? 
31553	1	a	mm-hmm . good safe ? 
31554	1	a	wow ! 
31555	4	a	 i guess if i make a mistake , i can just paint over it with a shrub or something . it's just , i think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs . so , i'm gonna limit myself to one shrub . 
31556	4	a	yeah . painting now . i just want to make sure that . . . 
31557	4	a	it's probably gonna be a few minutes . so you can just go back to doing whatever you were doing . 
31558	1	a	you get half now and half upon completion of said job . 
31559	1	a	you can't have someone murdered . 
31560	1	a	what did they do to you , angela ? 
31561	1	a	oh , monkey . oh , i feel for you . 
31562	1	a	yes . crazy . thank you . 
31563	1	a	no ! no ! 
31564	1	a	absolutely not . there are a lot of different ways to get revenge . i've had great success by defecating in a paper bag , put it on the porch--
31565	1	a	no ! you're not helping , trevor ! 
31566	1	a	no . angela ! what are you saying ? 
31567	1	a	i'm trying , but what you're asking is--
31568	1	a	okay . but it's cruel , because a woman with damaged knees can't scrub worth a damn . 
31569	2	a	you know , truth be told , i think all you'll really be doing is accepting calls from my clients while i'm gone . 
31570	2	a	you know , at the end of the day , it's really only two days . i mean , i'll be back in the office . ��if you need me for an emergency , call me . ��i'll be there . . . 
31571	2	a	tell me about it . 
31572	2	a	all right . you know what ? ��maybe we'll just . . . we'll go slow . 
31573	4	a	i could get us a complaint . 
31574	4	a	no , i wouldn't . i can't even relate to that impulse . but i bet i could get us a customer complaint . i'd like to try . 
31575	1	a	the target-- it's oscar , isn't it ? he and the senator are gaying each other . 
31576	1	a	your nostrils tell a different story . they flare like that every time you're engaging in deception . hello again , naughty nostrils . 
31577	1	a	well i could understand you wanting to get a stranger's knees whacked . but a co-worker-- dare i say , a friend ? 
31578	1	a	i can't even imagine how painful this must be for you . but the first ones to break your marriage vows were you and me . 
31579	1	a	what do you mean ? 
31580	1	a	no ! no , no ! 
31581	1	a	oscar ? oscar . oscar , good . hey come with me . 
31582	1	a	come -- come with me . 
31583	1	a	there are a bunch of construction workers in the warehouse without their trousers , drinking diet sodas . you have got to see this . they're extraordinary . 
31584	2	a	listen , i was really wondering if maybe we could lock this down before lunch is over . 
31585	2	a	all right . phyllis ! phyllis , that's-- that's decorative . 
31586	2	a	still decorative . 
31587	2	a	no . 
31588	2	a	don't-- don't-- don't pole people with knives . 
31589	2	a	phyllis ! ��wow . 
31590	1	a	there's no time to explain . okay , actually , there is time to explain . when angela found out that you seduced her husband , we hired a guy to break your knee caps . 
31591	1	a	what is wrong with you ? there are a million gorgeous guys in the scranton wilkes-barre area , and you choose the man who's the father of her child ? 
31592	1	a	oh , don't lie . i'm trying to save those precious knees you're always bragging about . ��now , let's get out of here . he could be right behind us . 
31593	1	a	aah ! actually , he's right in front of us . 
31594	1	a	no , trevor , i am not gonna let you . he's a dunder-mifflin man . he's my tribe . 
31595	1	a	disarm ! 
31596	1	a	don't move . and disarm now ! 
31597	1	a	no ! no , oscar . he's a friend . he's a friend . 
31598	4	a	 hello , this is pam halpert . i'm calling from dunder-mifflin . yes , your paper provider . and i just called to say . . . your mama is so fat , when she wears red , people yell , 'hey , kool-aid . ' yeah , your mama's fat . this is pam halpert . 
31599	4	a	basically i couldn't tell , but i think . . . 
31600	4	a	i-- i thought they were confused at least . . . 
31601	1	a	no . 
31602	1	a	see ya later , trevor . 
31603	1	a	i just saved your life . you're welcome ! 
31604	1	a	oscar . 
31605	4	a	i did not know that . 
31606	4	a	i'm so sorry . 
31607	1	a	you're not stupid . jazz is stupid . 
31608	1	a	i know . you're gonna be okay , monkey . 
31609	1	a	i don't like him either . ��and yet i really like him . 
31610	2	a	well , we're here . perfect . ��
31611	2	a	phyllis , what was that ? phyllis are you dreaming , or--
31612	2	a	this is hilarious , but we're gonna stop with all--
31613	2	a	shuckin' the peas . ��you should go back to the first part , though . you are ��gonna ��cover for me ? 
31614	2	a	oh , my god , thank you . thank you . 
31615	4	a	if you're an artist , you have to be okay with the idea ��that you can't please everybody all the time . 
31616	4	a	shut up , hide ! ��i mean , do you think kevin cares what people think about him-- or creed or meredith ? oh my gosh , these are my role models now . you know what ? i'm okay with that . 
31617	1	a	where does gayness come from ? and how is it transmitted ? 
31618	1	a	is it called red-vining ? 
31619	1	a	we heard it was called red-vining . 
31620	1	a	where are gay mens' vaginas ? 
31621	1	a	what ? 
31622	1	a	when two gay men have sex , how do they know whose penis will open up to accept the other person's penis ? 
31623	2	a	 i'm having second thoughts about one of the shirts i packed . the blue one with the stripes . 
31624	4	a	i'm sure it's fine . it's a blue shirt . 
31625	2	a	well , yeah , but i'm wondering if it's too blue . like , am i making a statement with the blueness ? 
31626	2	a	i am leaving early today for philly , because tomorrow is the first day of my new job . so i figure i'd get in at 5:00 , check into a hotel at about 6:00 so i can get a real good night of restless sleep and nervous puking . 
31627	1	a	uh , excuse me . trying to get work done . some people don't care about jim's new sports job in phila-whatever . 
31628	2	a	so you know my job has something to do with sports , but you don't know the end of the word 'philadelphia' ? 
31629	1	a	philadelphia . from the greek phila meaning 'love , ' and adelph , meaning 'adolf . ' 'the city that loves adolf . ' good luck with your new enterprise and don't wear the blue striped shirt . it makes your neck look like an old mop handle . 
31630	1	a	what about an authentic pennsylvania dutch christmas ? drink some gluhwein , enjoy some hasenpfeffer . enjoy christmas with saint nicolas' rural german companion , belsnickel . 
31631	2	a	yes ! that , that , that ! we're definitely doing that . are we all in agreement ? 
31632	2	a	done , right ? 
31633	1	a	or , who was it that suggested the authentic pennsylvania dutch christmas ? i think it was someone really popular . 
31634	1	a	 this is me and my family celebrating pennsylvania dutch christmas in 1982 on the farm . there's me and my brother jeb breaking the ceremonial pig rib . he doesn't come back for christmas anymore . the sepia tint is from an app on my phone . this is the same photo , matrix style . 
31635	2	a	i'm not understanding the confusion . am i the only one who wants to try hufflepuffs and schnauzerhosen , and meet this glenpickle guy ? 
31636	4	a	i'm on it . 
31637	2	a	right . 
31638	2	a	 we're thinking of collaborating with mike schmidt on some of his charity work . 
31639	2	a	whoo ! 
31640	2	a	yeah , i think so . 
31641	2	a	uh--
31642	4	a	we're the party planning committee , and we did not get where we are by playing it safe . we got here by being risk takers . and , yeah , dwight's party is gonna be terrible . maybe . maybe it's not . maybe it's going to be great . and if it's great . . . i think we all know what that would mean to us . 
31643	4	a	yes ! phyllis ! 
31644	4	a	what does that even mean ? where would your name appear ? 
31645	4	a	 the party planning committee , minus angela , has decided that we're all going to do dwight's christmas . 
31646	1	a	yes ! yeah ! yeah ! okay ! yes ! it's a christmas miracle ! yeah ! whoo-hoo ! 
31647	4	a	dwight , there is one rule that you need to take very seriously . 
31648	1	a	uh-huh . 
31649	4	a	and that is . . . 
31650	1	a	uh , oh . 
31651	4	a	that there are no rules . 
31652	1	a	you have never been cooler . 
31653	2	a	best christmas ever . 
31654	4	a	you're welcome . 
31655	2	a	thank you . 
31656	1	a	 and pennsylvania dutch christmas has officially begun . 
31657	1	a	that is gluhwein , otherwise known as glow-wine , also used to sterilize medical instruments . and , interesting factoid , this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when i was born . enjoy . 
31658	4	a	what is it ? don't touch it . 
31659	1	a	 somebody's found the hog maw . 
31660	4	a	oh ! 
31661	1	a	what ? it's a pennsylvania dutch specialty . hog maw . that's a beauty , isn't it ? i don't even want to tell you what it's made of until after you try it . 
31662	1	a	it is stuffed pig stomach . and , after we finish it , we get to break the pig rib . 
31663	2	a	can't wait . 
31664	1	a	this is austere , meredith . this is celebrating christmas for all of the right reasons . the cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions . i mean , most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a shepherd's crook , which i assure you does not taste like peppermint . it tastes like sheep feces . 
31665	1	a	have you ever tasted a shepherd's crook ? 
31666	2	a	i don't know . is it what you expected ? 
31667	4	a	i feel like --dwight is holding a candle and reading a poem . 
31668	2	a	so happy right now . 
31669	1	a	 wait , what is that i hear ? is someone on the roof ? how strange . excuse me . i have to run to my car to take a dump . 
31670	1	a	 ohh . . . judgment is nigh , for the belsnickel ist i ! 
31671	2	a	yes , he is finally nigh . 
31672	1	a	i am nigh ! 
31673	1	a	every year , my grandfather would dress up as belsnickel at christmas . he was . . . okay at it . i am great . you know how they say some people were born to be bad ? well , i was born to be belsnickel . 
31674	1	a	ooh , belsnickel has traveled from distant lands to discover how all the boys and the girls have been behaving this last year . whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo ! ohh . . . too much strudel . 
31675	2	a	so he's kind of like santa , except dirty and worse . 
31676	1	a	no , much better--no one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel . 
31677	2	a	wow ! it's my favorite part of christmas . the authority . 
31678	4	a	and the fear . 
31679	1	a	yes , exactly ! 
31680	1	a	no . 
31681	4	a	wow . 
31682	1	a	okay , great . seriously , you guys ? now you believe in dwight's traditions , when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia ? 
31683	1	a	oh , come on . we don't blindly stick to every outmoded aspect of our traditions . come on , get with the spirit of it , you guys . 
31684	1	a	take a bowl and pass it down . 
31685	1	a	no , these are gift bowls . when you recieve a gift , it will go in the bowl , but the bowls must be returned at the end . they're a set . now , hold your bowls forward . the belsnickel will decide if you are impish or admirable . 
31686	2	a	oh , it's like naughty or nice . 
31687	1	a	no , impish or admirable . 
31688	2	a	quick question--do you just decide who gets what in the moment , or did you make a list ? 
31689	1	a	i decided earlier . 
31690	2	a	oh , nice . did you check that list ? 
31691	1	a	of course i checked it . 
31692	2	a	but more than once ? 'cause you could have made a mistake . 
31693	1	a	i checked it more than once . 
31694	2	a	okay , so you made a list , you checked it twice , and now you're gonna find out who's--
31695	1	a	impish or admirable . 
31696	2	a	damn . 
31697	1	a	phyllis vance ! cheer or fear ? belsnickel is here ! i judge your year as . . . admirable . there you are . 
31698	1	a	it's a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars . 
31699	1	a	you can't have the bowl ! oscar martinez , cheer or fear ? belsnickel is here ! i judge your year . . . as impish ! 
31700	1	a	no , i'm carrying around the stick in order to look cool . for the kinder 
31701	2	a	ooh . 
31702	4	a	 mouse trap . 
31703	1	a	in a head-to-head contest , people prefer belsnickel over santa every time . there aren't as many songs about him , but i attribute that more to rhyming difficulties . my brother and i wrote one once . it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel . 
31704	2	a	oh , you know what ? i gotta go . 
31705	1	a	stop giggling . 
31706	4	a	oh , really ? already ? 
31707	2	a	yeah , it's all right . 
31708	1	a	it's a punishment . hey , where are you going ? 
31709	2	a	i have to go to philly . but this was amazing . okay . 
31710	1	a	but you work tomorrow . 
31711	2	a	yeah , i know , i'd just like to settle in and get a good night's sleep . 
31712	1	a	but we were gonna break the pig rib . 
31713	2	a	ooh . 
31714	1	a	remember ? 
31715	2	a	that's right . 
31716	1	a	no matter ! belsnickel cares not about this--off with you ! 
31717	2	a	perfect . merry christmas , everybody . 
31718	1	a	wait , wait , wait , wait ! don't you want to know your present ? 
31719	2	a	you know what ? yeah . have at it . 
31720	1	a	jim halpert . cheer or fear ? belsnickel is here ! i judge your year as impish . 
31721	2	a	ooh ! are you nuts ? 
31722	1	a	 i judge you impish ! 
31723	2	a	ow ! ow ! okay , that is three , and you didn't hit anybody that hard . 
31724	1	a	they're not abandoning the party . 
31725	2	a	just--just--hey ! 
31726	2	a	 that's enough , i'm done ! okay ? agh ! 
31727	1	a	 impish ! 
31728	2	a	aah ! ow ! 
31729	2	a	 oh . . . what was that ? now i'm gonna be all whipped for my first day at work . god . one second . oh . . . 
31730	4	a	well . . . this is it . 
31731	2	a	i'm probably never gonna see you again . 
31732	4	a	shut up . i'm trying to be serious . 
31733	2	a	okay , sorry , sorry . 
31734	4	a	i can't believe this is actually happening . 
31735	2	a	listen , thank you so much for putting that all together . that was the perfect last christmas party . all right , wish me luck . 
31736	4	a	okay . good luck . you're gonna be great . 
31737	2	a	i'll call you when i get in . 
31738	4	a	okay . 
31739	2	a	all right . 
31740	4	a	love you . 
31741	2	a	love you . 
31742	4	a	what's going on ? 
31743	1	a	party's over . you quit on christmas , christmas quits on you . and guess what , kids . belsnickel isn't real . it's me , dwight ! 
31744	4	a	for what it's worth , i liked your party better . 
31745	1	a	everyone thought the food was gross , and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak . 
31746	4	a	i don't think anyone thought that . 
31747	1	a	jim couldn't even stay till the end of the party . 
31748	4	a	well , that didn't have anything to do with you . 
31749	1	a	i don't care . guess how much i care on a scale of one to ten . 
31750	4	a	zero . 
31751	1	a	damn it ! 
31752	4	a	dwight , want me to get you some eggnog ? 
31753	1	a	no , thanks . i'll just have another dumatril . jim taught me this really cool way to take it . you crush it into a powder , and you snort it up your butt . 
31754	2	a	 yep , i did say that . 
31755	4	a	jim ! 
31756	2	a	what's going on ? where's the belsnickel ? 
31757	4	a	oh--oh my god ! 
31758	2	a	what are you doing ? last time i saw you , you were whipping me out of the building . 
31759	1	a	 shh . let's not speak of that . the pig rib ! we could totally break the pig rib ! i'm gonna dig it out of the trash ! 
31760	4	a	what happened ? did you miss your bus ? 
31761	2	a	no . i just missed my wife . 
31762	1	a	 i found it ! 
31763	2	a	and i found out that there's a bus at 5:00 a . m . 
31764	1	a	oh ! damn it ! jim got the bigger half . 
31765	2	a	ooh , nog it . let me get some nog . thanks , phyllis . where's andy ? 
31766	2	a	oh , hey , man . oh , you know what ? before i forget again , i talked to the guys about hiring you . they're gonna bring you in for an interview . 
31767	2	a	right ? 
31768	2	a	hey , of course . 
31769	2	a	thank you , sir . 
31770	2	a	go get 'em . 
31771	1	a	very impish . 
31772	2	a	i think they're going to the conference finals . 
31773	2	a	bynum , obvious monster and the three point shooting , don't even- . . . 
31774	2	a	i bit my lip at lunch today . 
31775	2	a	now i have this big bump in my lip that hurts . i hate it . 
31776	2	a	okay , you need to think about it before you come with the . . . 
31777	2	a	whatever . it's not a big deal . you know i always tell my three year old , if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen . . . you gotta be kidding me ! ok ! pam ! that's it , i'm going home ! 
31778	4	a	what ? 
31779	2	a	i am meeting dr . j today , otherwise known as julius irving , famed 76er and my own personal hero . but i have to be careful not to rub it in pam's face because let's be honest , how would i feel if i was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with john stamos . 
31780	2	a	 you sound tired . everything ok ? 
31781	4	a	great . everything's great . hey are you nervous about your big meeting ? 
31782	2	a	uhh , a little bit . it's a lot of pressure , you know , but that's what i signed up for right ? 
31783	2	a	uh , you know what , i gotta hop off because my , uh , taxi is here to take me to the meeting . 
31784	4	a	oh , call me later ! 
31785	2	a	ok
31786	4	a	good luck ! 
31787	2	a	thanks ! 
31788	4	a	love you . 
31789	2	a	love you too . bye . 
31790	4	a	hey meredith , i need your supplier requests today . 
31791	4	a	he didn't leave me . he just went part time . can you just fill out the form please ? 
31792	4	a	i'm sure she's just confused . people scratch their heads when they're confused . not always like an ape , the way meredith just did , but it happens . 
31793	1	a	what ? lice ? oh my god . lock the doors , we are on full quarantine . 
31794	4	a	dwight , relax . it's just lice . maybe , possibly . 
31795	1	a	just lice pam ? 
31796	1	a	of all of the vermin in god's great green kingdom , lice are the ones i detest the most . my first day of school , i had lice , and no one would play with me . for 15 years , they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher . all because i had lice when i was 7 . 
31797	1	a	make way , nope , inspect me . 
31798	1	a	should be . i use lice shampoo every morning . 
31799	4	a	stop that ! 
31800	4	a	alright , let's give her a break . we don't know for sure this is meredith's fault . 
31801	4	a	no ! how ? i'm so clean ! 
31802	1	a	it's a hazmat suit . that stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing . if you rent more than four times a year , it just makes sense to buy . is there anyone else here that is lice free ? excellent . do you have your own hazmat suits ? 
31803	1	a	renters . ok , i'm gonna need you to gather your belongings , retreat to the warehouse , conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused . let's get going . i'm gonna stay here and fight . if you don't hear from me by lunch , call me . i might want lunch . 
31804	4	a	guys , i think we should all ease up on meredith . this has got to be hard for her . 
31805	4	a	maybe it was meredith . maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from cece . so let's not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me . that is how wars get started . fine , i'll tell her it was me . 
31806	2	a	oh man , that's fresh squeezed . and , uh are all the snacks complimentary ? 
31807	2	a	oh no , no , no . that's ok . um i'm sorry , is this the conference center ? 
31808	2	a	you gotta be kidding me . 
31809	4	a	hey , meredith i need to tell you something . 
31810	4	a	oh my god , meredith what are you doing ! ?

31879	4	a	you ready for your interview ? 
31880	4	a	well , you shouldn't be nervous about this . this is a tiny start-up with a bunch of guys just as dorky as jim . 
31881	4	a	really , you can't be scared of a room full of jims . i love the guy , but he's basically gumby with hair . 
31882	1	a	you know , you're right ! we hadn't even thought of that , had we boy ? 
31883	1	a	 oh ! you're a hunter i see . spend your early mornings out in the blinds , like clarky and me . huh ?

31894	2	a	 actually , you know what ? give me one second , okay ? make yourselves at home . 
31895	1	a	'but i think that all of your concerns will be answered when you see the brochure that clark's getting out of my car . he's a good boy , does whatever i say . 
31896	1	a	oh' really . 
31897	1	a	 well , things between me and clark are good , but not great . in fact , i will say that they're not even good . really , they're bad . like you and your son . 
31898	1	a	what took you so long ? were you loitering out there like a hooligan , smoking a doobie ? 
31899	1	a	you're being disrespectful ! 
31900	1	a	 we don't get along . 
31901	1	a	terrible ! 
31902	1	a	yes ! genius . stupid , stupid genius ! 
31903	4	a	wow , this place is' so great . i had no idea ' on the phone , you made it sound kind of dinky . 
31904	2	a	well , i mean , i don't even have the paycheck yet . it is a startup , so' these things go down all the time . 
31905	2	a	 are you cool to just hang out ? 
31906	4	a	sure , no problem . 
31907	2	a	yeah ? you ready ? 
31908	2	a	let's do it ! 
31909	1	a	i bet you have . he knows nothing about what people have heard before , my son . 
31910	1	a	maybe if you listened a little bit , you'd improve . no wonder women despise you . 
31911	1	a	his last girlfriend was a transvestite . i knew it right away . adam's apple like the prow of a ship , thumbs like a lowland gorilla . ha , but this one couldn't see it , or didn't wanna see it . 
31912	1	a	yeah ? like what ? 
31913	1	a	that never happened . he's always been a liar . ever since he was a little kid . he got caught 'saving treats' from the kitty litter box . 
31914	1	a	glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers . 
31915	1	a	following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail , going 'please kitty , may i have some more ? ' you can't make this stuff up ! 
31916	1	a	 got cat turd collector written all over him . 
31917	2	a	mm-hm
31918	2	a	and as you know , i was a paper salesman . hey , i find it helps if you just picture everybody naked . 
31919	4	a	that's sweet that he talks about me . 
31920	4	a	well , that's funny because i think of him as working part time in philadelphia . 
31921	1	a	do you mind ? the men are talking . 
31922	1	a	us old timers need to stick together . and how better than by signing a contract ? 
31923	1	a	wait , so you're the boss ? 
31924	4	a	they're the ones who put a fish tank next to a basketball hoop . it's like if i put a glass of milk on the edge of the table and cece knocks it over , i don't blame cece . 
31925	4	a	say they don't hire you . it's not like you're out on the street . you have a great job with people who love you . 
31926	4	a	right ? thank you ! it's just philly . everyone's acting like it's new york or paris or london . 
31927	4	a	not us . 
31928	2	a	 okay , so the consensus was that that was unique . they're going to make you pay for the fish , and' they wanted to know when you can start . 
31929	4	a	congratulations . 
31930	4	a	i guess you gotta move to philly after all . 
31931	4	a	no , i'm not upset . i'm really excited for darryl' maybe i'm a little disappointed that we'll be losing him . 
31932	1	a	yeah , you don't want italian . you'll look like a mafia don . next thing you know , you'll be doing life in rikers island . 
31933	1	a	that place doesn't exist . it's not a documented island . ha ha , cartograph much ? 
31934	1	a	actually' you look great . they steered you right . i guess it does make sense buying from a father son team . you know what ? i'll take one too . 
31935	4	a	 everybody dance now' 
31936	1	a	yes ! we did it ! 
31937	1	a	and you closed it . the boys are back in town . high fives ! ha ha ! 
31938	1	a	you got me ! i used to collect them ! 
31939	1	a	each one is very different , like a snowflake . 
31940	4	a	 hey' what happened here ? 
31941	4	a	'are the pens here ? 
31942	4	a	: did you send dwight on a quest for the holy grail ?

31961	1	a	pfft , 'athlead' ? please . they're too lazy to call it athletes lead ? jim should just call it 'stumpany , ' for 'stupid company . '
31962	1	a	you're working for 'stumpany' too ? 
31963	1	a	what ? 
31964	1	a	 hey , halpert , what's the big idea ? first you jump ship . now you're stealing darryl too . when will it end ? 
31965	2	a	well , take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity .

31980	2	a	it's insane . this huge investor got cold feet , so i'm stuck here trying to keep him on board . 
31981	4	a	hon , i wish you would have told me an hour ago , when you knew you weren't gonna make it . 
31982	2	a	pam , i couldn't get out . i barely made it out just to make this phone call .

31995	1	a	okay , i'm gonna need you to print it out . 
31996	1	a	 customer loyalty . what is it ? can you hold it in your hand ? can you nudge it with your finger ? can you dump it on a woman ? no . why ? because it's an idea . but what does it mean ? 
31997	1	a	not even close . mr . romanko has been a client for 20 years . he came in today in a rage . why ? because of darryl . because darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client . 
31998	1	a	no , you're not going anywhere , okay ? you are angry , and we are gonna hear you out , all right ? because business is about relationships , and the key to relationships is what , darryl ? ��l--

32008	1	a	it can't be more fun than selling paper and paper products . 
32009	1	a	are you pretending to be crazy , huh ? 
32010	2	a	uh , wade actually has those on the road , but he's gonna be calling in with those numbers any second . so just hold on one s--

32023	4	a	all right , you don't have to . 
32024	4	a	okay . 
32025	4	a	wait . what ? 
32026	4	a	 excuse me , i have to get back to work . 
32027	4	a	oh , no . i took a phone call in the middle of taping , and then when i went to turn it back on , i must have turned it off . 
32028	4	a	well , it was an important phone call . 
32029	4	a	i haven't told anyone here about the mural yet . i want jim to be the first to know . whenever i tell him good news , he's always like , 'beesly ! ' i love that . only thing better than getting the job-- 'beesly ! ' 
32030	1	a	 it barely even feels like a prank anymore . 
32031	1	a	ha ha ! yeah , joke's on you buddy ! they make you come back and clean it up ! 
32032	1	a	what ? what was that ? did i just hear you laughing with glee ?

32039	4	a	i'm so sorry . 
32040	2	a	i have no idea where we're gonna come up with this money , and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks . 
32041	4	a	 oh , i'm sorry . i feel like you've already been working insanely hard . 
32042	2	a	can you figure out how to upload cece's dance recital ? i definitely could use a pick-me-up . 
32043	4	a	um , actually , funny story -- i didn't get it . i shouldn't have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all . 
32044	2	a	you're not serious , are you ? you didn't get any of the recital ? 
32045	4	a	no , i got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards . but not so much of the middle part . 
32046	2	a	come on , pam . pam , i asked you if you could use the phone , and you swore that you knew how . 
32047	4	a	yeah , okay , i'm sorry . i'm sure we can get a copy . a lot of people were taping it . 
32048	2	a	oh , great . so we'll see somebody else's kid with cece in the background ? i mean , it's really not that hard to film a video . 
32049	4	a	is there-- um . . . you want to ease up a little bit ? 
32050	2	a	look , pam , i don't know what to tell you . i mean , what do i do ? it's gone . that moment's just gone . i missed it . 
32051	4	a	i don't know , jim -- maybe you should have been there . 
32052	2	a	you're not serious , right ? i mean , how is that fair ? i'm in philly . these are my days in philly . you've agreed to this . 
32053	4	a	you know what ? i-- i-- i don't think you want to start a conversation with me about what's fair . okay ? this is way more intense than i ever --
32054	2	a	pam , i'm not explaining this to you-- pam , i'm not going over this again . 
32055	2	a	i don't know how else to tell you , okay ? i'm doing everything i can every week to bring home something . . . 
32056	4	a	i am-- i am-- i am trying to make everything perfect here , okay ? so that you can have everything that you want . 
32057	2	a	i'm doing this just for me ? is that what i'm doing ? i'm doing it just for me . if that's what you think , then this is a really sad night . but you know what ? i got to go . okay ? 
32058	4	a	yep .

32064	4	a	it's getting tougher . i just didn't know that it was gonna be this hard . 
32065	4	a	thank you . 
32066	4	a	hey brian , you got a sec ? 
32067	4	a	i feel awful . 
32068	4	a	well , thanks for being a good friend . 
32069	4	a	yeah , mostly . 
32070	4	a	um , hey , say hi to alyssa . 
32071	4	a	okay . thank you . 
32072	1	a	that's right , a couple of old friends . ballers only . must be this cool to ride . 
32073	1	a	oh , did i ? oh , yes , i did . 
32074	1	a	wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at jim's desk while he's away in philly . finally i'll have someone at my desk clump who gets me . it's like , 'really , jim ? you don't understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant ? uh , remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses . ' wow . 
32075	1	a	mm-hmm . 
32076	1	a	you know what ? you're gonna get your interview , okay ? i know that you're going head-to-head against some real superstars , but you got a really good chance . 
32077	1	a	clark has no chance . i mean , he's up against my buddy rolf , for god's sake . guy goes fishing with hand grenades . and trevor ' he'll make you laugh so hard , you'll puke your pants . 
32078	1	a	big changes coming to the old desk clump . no longer a pam-jim alliance against dwight . now it is dwight and a friend axis against pam . 
32079	2	a	you could've just called that an alliance too , right ? 
32080	1	a	i chose my words very carefully . 
32081	2	a	things are a little delicate with me and pam right now . and if my working in philly is gonna end up doubling the dwight in her life , that's only gonna make things worse . 
32082	1	a	hey . come on , buddy . let's do this . sorry , rolf goes first . you don't compare . when you're with the r-o-l-f , you're literally rolling on the laughing floor . 
32083	1	a	rolf is my best friend , and he is the man . cool , calm , and collected 24/7 . just try and rattle rolf . i dare you . such a sweet guy . 
32084	4	a	when are you talking to david wallace ? 
32085	2	a	i'm talking to him this afternoon , but don't get your hopes up . 
32086	4	a	too late . my hopes are up . 
32087	2	a	last week , my company in philly lost a big investor , so we're scrambling to find new funding . luckily , my partners have a fix ' me asking the boss of the company i'm abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash . so' problem solved . thanks , guys . 
32088	1	a	and this chair's gonna be yours . and this desk . ha ! 
32089	2	a	i'm on the phone . i'm on the phone . 
32090	1	a	no doy ! 
32091	2	a	i'm just gonna call you back . thanks . 
32092	1	a	 no earbuds ! 
32093	2	a	i'm sure he's just nervous . 
32094	4	a	 it's fine . it's just a seating arrangement . doesn't matter . 
32095	1	a	so i've got your resume here , but it's not telling me everything . 
32096	1	a	well , i'm the one offering the job . 
32097	1	a	i've worked here for 12 years . i won salesman of the year . i'm an assistant to the regional manager . 
32098	1	a	wait , wait , wait , no , i mean , if you need to know more , you can call david wallace . i'm sure he'd give a reference . 
32099	1	a	well , they can't all be winners . but trevor's next and he's a real professional . you say , 'jump , ' and he says , 'oh who ? ' he loves to jump on people , that trevor . 
32100	1	a	what makes you think you'd be an effective paper salesman ? 
32101	1	a	well , it's a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman . 
32102	1	a	all right . do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter ? 
32103	1	a	there were only two options . 
32104	1	a	this is a bus transfer . 
32105	2	a	sure , yeah , go ahead . 
32106	2	a	yeah , absolutely . do people like sitting next to you ? you're clean , right ? 
32107	2	a	nice . music . do you listen to it in earbuds ? you don't listen to it at all because we're at work , not a florence and the machine concert , so'
32108	2	a	sure , yeah . do whatever you need to do . 
32109	2	a	right after you do one thing for me . i need you to breathe in my face . 
32110	2	a	i need you to breathe in my face right now . 
32111	2	a	what are we working with , peppermint or wintergreen ? 
32112	2	a	i knew it , i knew it . 
32113	2	a	i looked at you coming around , and i said , 'wintergreen . '
32114	1	a	i can't hire clark . yeah , he looks like a schrute , but he thinks like a halpert and he acts like a beesly . 
32115	1	a	okay , here's one . a customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock . you can't rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party . 
32116	1	a	thank you . 
32117	1	a	damn it ! perfect answer , again . 
32118	1	a	think dwight , think . you have a ream of 16-bond '
32119	1	a	and anoth'
32120	1	a	no . 
32121	1	a	it does , but still no . 
32122	1	a	oh , you think they're my only friends ? i've got way more friends than that , and they're all better than the losers who work here . 
32123	4	a	well , of course not , but does physical appearance include smell ? 
32124	1	a	next up , my cousin mose . mose could make a great paper salesman . he's got a natural fear of paper , which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible . i've got big expectations , mose-wise . 
32125	1	a	what quality would make you a good sales associate ? 
32126	1	a	it says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for dow chemical . 
32127	1	a	you know we live together , right ? 
32128	1	a	and i've never seen you go to work , ever . 
32129	1	a	so why is this on your resume ? 
32130	2	a	how is it my fault ? 
32131	2	a	but it's dwight who's bring in all the weirdos . 
32132	4	a	hey , i'm the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when jim's away . i'm in a position where i'm rooting for nate , and that just feels wrong . forget it . i need to work on my mural . i have some pointy trees that i need to round off . 
32133	2	a	yeah , this is actually about the new sales guy . uh , dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos . and i was wondering if i could have some input'
32134	1	a	 this is dwight schrute . who am i speaking to ? and don't lie . i can tell if you're lying . 
32135	1	a	david . 
32136	1	a	really ? that's interesting . 'cause i was thinking that since jim is only here part time , he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who's here every day . and frankly , killing it lately . 
32137	2	a	i was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk , near my wife'
32138	2	a	oh . um'
32139	2	a	okay . i can't say that that's not fair . 
32140	1	a	sounds fair to me , david . 
32141	2	a	oh , yeah , so we'll just do that later . 
32142	1	a	no . why not do it now ? 
32143	2	a	uh' well , it's about athlead . i'm sorry . does dwight have to be on this part of the phone call ? 
32144	1	a	i'd love to be in the loop , david . 
32145	2	a	there's a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor '
32146	2	a	yes , okay . bye . 
32147	1	a	 i'd love to invest . 
32148	2	a	no , thanks . 
32149	1	a	i'd like to give you $100 million . 
32150	4	a	hide , they're giving out jobs upstairs . why don't you go up and get one ? 
32151	4	a	yeah . 
32152	2	a	dwight , you can't just hire someone 'cause they're your friend . 
32153	1	a	i'm not . these people are the best of the best . i find talent an attractive quality in a friend . 
32154	1	a	you know who else was a freak ? spider-man . and he was also a hero . 
32155	1	a	mandatory paintball . uh , wolf , please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch . 
32156	1	a	wolf is hilarious . he has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range . half of 'em , we were on the same team . oh my god . how i screamed . ah , that goof . 
32157	1	a	sell me this piece of paper . watch this . 
32158	1	a	i sure do . 
32159	1	a	i will pay you whatever it takes . 
32160	1	a	no , you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it . so here , just take my money . 
32161	1	a	okay . good . that was great . so . wow . you're still at the 570 number ? 
32162	1	a	okay . good , good , good . 
32163	1	a	this isn't gonna work out . 
32164	1	a	 no , no , no . i just need to tell them . i just need to tell them . 
32165	1	a	i do that myself now . 
32166	1	a	no , you've been towed by now . they tow after about 45 minutes . 
32167	1	a	or none of you 
32168	1	a	i wish i could hire all of you . 
32169	1	a	psst . jim jim ? jim , turn around . jim , turn around . jim , turn around . 
32170	2	a	ahh , i love staring off in one direction . if i'm not looking south , i'm not livin' . that's what i always say . 
32171	1	a	just act natural . 
32172	1	a	and i was thinking it's only fair that you help make this decision since they'll be sitting at your desk next to your wife . 
32173	2	a	but you know i wouldn't hire any of these all-stars . 
32174	1	a	aah ! god , that sucks ! aah ! what are you gonna do ? i mean , it's your call . 
32175	2	a	nope . your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought ? not even gabor ? 
32176	1	a	i guess i just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends . i just couldn't picture any of them in the old gold and gray . 
32177	2	a	i knew it . you designed a uniform for dunder mifflin . 
32178	1	a	summer . winter . jungle . formal . 
32179	2	a	well , i for one , was amazed at how qualified everyone was . you ? 
32180	1	a	yes . thank you . amazed . 
32181	2	a	and i gotta say , this was a tough decision . and we had to go with none of you . 
32182	1	a	what ? this is such bullcrap ! 
32183	2	a	well , you know , wallace put me in charge , so you have no say . 
32184	1	a	wow . so much crap . it's just a load of b . c . how could you do this to them ? 
32185	2	a	too much now . 
32186	1	a	okay . 
32187	1	a	okay , this is an outrage . ugh ! you know what ? this is jim halpert's home address , in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever . 
32188	2	a	that seems inconsiderate . 
32189	1	a	guys , it wasn't up to me . rolf , come on . guys , it wasn't my choice ! i would have hired all of you ! gabor , gabor . 
32190	1	a	oh , that sounds awesome . can we wait till i get off work ? 
32191	1	a	okay . 
32192	2	a	all right . i think that went well . 
32193	2	a	so , uh , if you just take a look at this , and then that'll print out'hey . meet your new desk mate . 
32194	4	a	oh , cool . hey clark . 
32195	2	a	trust me , this is the least of all evils . it took me all day to pull this off , so you should be thrilled , considering . 
32196	4	a	yeah , i guess . i mean , i kinda liked my old desk mate . 
32197	2	a	okay . i'm really sorry i told the guys i'd be there for the board meeting . 
32198	4	a	of course . 
32199	2	a	i'll call you when i get there . 
32200	4	a	okay . 
32201	2	a	all right . 
32202	4	a	bye . 
32203	2	a	take care of my wife . i will be back . 
32204	1	a	they say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives . well i just outgrew them all in the span of three hours . 
32205	4	a	i'm good . 
32206	1	a	oh , hey , i'll take a coffee . 
32207	4	a	hey , dwight . wanna haze the new guy ? 
32208	1	a	who , me ? 
32209	4	a	us . 
32210	1	a	absolutely , i do . 
32211	4	a	okay . okay , here . okay , so the next time he goes to the bathroom , i'll distract him , you take that . 
32212	1	a	okay , yeah , i know what to do . okay . oh , that's great . 
32213	1	a	aah ! 
32214	1	a	welcome to the club , pig ! 
32215	4	a	no , dwight ! 
32216	1	a	aah ! 
32217	2	a	no , it does matter who ends up sitting next to pam when i'm gone . the people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with . i mean , because of where my desk was , i spent all those years looking at pam , and i fell in love . so , that stuff matters . definitely does . 
32218	2	a	 hey . 
32219	2	a	we are splitting a sublet on a place near philly . 
32220	2	a	and , as much as i miss pam and the kids , it's , uh , kinda nice to live the bachelor life again . you know , let your hair down . 
32221	2	a	i'm couching it ! 
32222	2	a	and this dude labels his food . he's the clean one . and , i'm the messy one . how much fun is this ? 
32223	2	a	hey . so , wade wants to send people to the sloan conference . we gotta compile a list of our target clients . 
32224	2	a	 who is this guy ? we are killing it . 
32225	2	a	yeah ! 
32226	4	a	 conference room . everybody . now ! 
32227	1	a	you don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting . 
32228	4	a	yes , but david wallace does . and he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff . . . that's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting . 
32229	1	a	you're telling me , david wallace asked you to call a super secret , classified conference room meeting ? 
32230	4	a	yeah . 
32231	1	a	let's go everyone . super secret , classified conference room meeting , now ! 
32232	4	a	 i have terrible news . someone defaced my mural . they painted all over it . 
32233	4	a	yeah , but this is different . 
32234	4	a	i don't think so , but they put paint where i didn't want paint . so . . . 
32235	4	a	different colored paint . i wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint . so , it just is . . . ok , the point is , these warehouse guys are vandals . and , they need to be stopped . 
32236	4	a	yes . thank you . let's answer that question . 
32237	4	a	what ? come on guys . we need to figure out who did this and punish them . this isn't just about me . this is about all of us . this is our mural . don't you see ? how much we worked on this ? how much time and energy ? we put our heart and soul into this thing . 
32238	4	a	sure did . i was as surprised as you , but apparently , he is very passionate about public art . 
32239	4	a	 no , no . come on , guys . don't go . 
32240	1	a	pam , i'll help you . 
32241	4	a	you will ? 
32242	1	a	if there's anything i hate worse than art , it's crime . 
32243	4	a	thank you . 
32244	4	a	yeah ? 
32245	4	a	great . 
32246	4	a	i was hoping for a righteous mob , and i ended up with dwight and nellie . but , they both have a mob mentality . and , i'm pretty sure dwight has a pitchfork in his car . 
32247	1	a	 you need my pitchfork ? 
32248	1	a	what is it ? i have vengeance to exact . 
32249	1	a	ah , i'm not interested . 
32250	1	a	if i get the deicing gig , it's not gonna be on merit . not because i played politics . 
32251	1	a	 i am handing out pieces of paper . on which , you will draw one human butt . what i do with said drawings , is no one's business but my own . 
32252	1	a	incorrect . it is my fetish . oh , also , sign them . my fetish is signed drawings of butts . 
32253	1	a	yes . or nipplous breasts . perhaps . 
32254	1	a	or melons . like cantaloups . with the halves are cut off . and then , just the bottom parts . . . 
32255	4	a	we need another approach . um , we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group . yeah . i think if we could get nate alone , we could crack him . 
32256	1	a	we just need a pretense to talk to him . we could tell him that his mother is dying . that usually works on him . nate . your mother is dying . 
32257	4	a	see , i feel bad about that . 
32258	1	a	it's all right . it's all right . 
32259	1	a	no . she needs her rest again . 
32260	1	a	you know who the vandal is . now , i know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends , but we've got chewing gum . 
32261	4	a	 tell us who defaced the mural ! 
32262	4	a	all right . you can go . give him his gum . 
32263	1	a	there's no gum . there never was any gum . 
32264	2	a	nice job , man . 
32265	2	a	 what ? oh , man ! i'm sorry about that . 
32266	2	a	oh , um . . . are you really mad about this ? 
32267	2	a	oh . it's your go-to therm . oh , man . that's a bummer . i'm sorry about that . 
32268	2	a	no , no . if it's a big deal , it's a big deal . 
32269	2	a	no big deal . 
32270	2	a	honestly , i don't mind . did you want me to wash it for you or . . . 
32271	2	a	 ok . here ya go . 
32272	4	a	 maybe , maybe i could , could get the ball rolling . um , frank ? hi . pam . um , i am so sorry if i've done anything to offend you . i'm sure it isn't easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space . so . truly . if , if , i apologize . but enough about me . your turn . 
32273	4	a	well , i didn't think that butt was funny . 
32274	4	a	what was that ? 
32275	4	a	whoa ! hey ! that is not ok . what are you gonna do about that ? 
32276	4	a	that sucked . he didn't apologize . there's no talking to that guy . 
32277	1	a	oh , your little feelings party didn't work out ? huh ? who won the hugging contest ? oh , let me guess . everyone tied for first . 
32278	4	a	we should just take him down . 
32279	1	a	wait . are you saying . . . 
32280	4	a	i'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face . 
32281	1	a	normally , i find pam to be a comforting , if unarousing , presence around the office . like a well-watered fern . but , today , she has tapped into this vengeful , violent side . and i'm like , wow , pam has kind of a good butt . 
32282	1	a	he messed with something that was important to you . we need to mess with something that's important to him . 
32283	4	a	yes ! 
32284	1	a	a little eye for an eye action . 
32285	4	a	yes ! 
32286	1	a	go all hammurabi on this clown .

32293	2	a	 it's mine . don't worry . 
32294	2	a	i don't think you had to . 
32295	2	a	i think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing , man . i mean , you put your name on a five pound bag of flour . are you honestly saying that if i needed flour i couldn't use that ? 
32296	2	a	that's not the point . 
32297	2	a	no , i'm not making bread . 
32298	2	a	darryl , it doesn't matter . i think you know the point i'm trying to make . 
32299	2	a	it's all good . are we all good ? 
32300	2	a	what's that cooler ? 
32301	2	a	oh , crap . were those yours ?

32326	1	a	ugh ! don't sympathize . you're ruining the mood . back to work . draw his penis . 
32327	4	a	i got back at frank in the most fitting way possible . with my art . the paints are water-based . it's gonna come off with a hose . but , i think the lesson will last a very . . . 
32328	4	a	no , you had no right ! 
32329	4	a	so ? you started it ! 
32330	4	a	whoa . 
32331	4	a	well , i'm gonna say something to the producers . 
32332	4	a	you shouldn't be fired . i mean , you were just protecting me . 
32333	4	a	forget about my mural . it's stupid . 
32334	4	a	it's crazy . brian , i'm so sorry . 
32335	4	a	thanks , brian . 
32336	2	a	wow . this whole philly thing has been so much fun that i may have lost sight of what really matters . i mean , having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about . i mean , that's just 'roommates 101' . 
32337	2	a	oh . oh ! 
32338	2	a	 you win . how good did that feel ? 
32339	4	a	 hey . i feel so lucky we're in the same city for valentine's day . 
32340	2	a	it's like magic . or , it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a tuesday for a thursday . 
32341	4	a	 alakazam ! 
32342	2	a	by the way , they do need an extra day next week . 
32343	4	a	and , poof ! he disappears .

32345	1	a	 andy , hi . i just made another huge sale for the company that you manage . i need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract . 
32346	1	a	 i would be happy to . it would be my pleasure , mr . schrute . rick-a-dick-doo , rick-a-dick-dick-dick , rick-a-dick-doo . 
32347	1	a	i really like andy these days . he's pretend and he does exactly as i tell him to . all that will change when real andy comes back tomorrow . unless he comes back as pretend dwight . in which case , we're in for an epic , confusing showdown . 
32348	4	a	 these are gross . 
32349	2	a	they are terrible . 
32350	4	a	oh , hey , don't fill up on chocolates . i made us a lunch reservation at state street grill . 
32351	2	a	oh my god . that's so romantic . 
32352	4	a	it's with brian and alyssa . 
32353	2	a	oh my god . that's less romantic . 
32354	4	a	i know . but we should go . we need to thank him for , you know , saving my life . 
32355	2	a	yeah , yeah . no , totally . that's good . so , should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate ? 
32356	4	a	that sounds nice . 
32357	2	a	i'm very excited to see brian . brian's a great guy . and pam and i have gotten really close to he and his wife , alyssa over the years . and he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse . i'm sorry , but you know him . he's a good guy . 
32358	2	a	 hey , brian . 
32359	4	a	sorry we're late . 
32360	4	a	ha , ha , ha , yeah ok . 
32361	2	a	what ? 
32362	4	a	he's on a no carb thing . supposedly . 
32363	2	a	oh . 
32364	4	a	yeah . 
32365	2	a	are you kidding ? thank you , man . i mean , i've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for . . . everything . and i'm really sorry about the job . that just seems crazy . 
32366	4	a	well , my dad can't hear a thing . you could boom his whole life for him . 
32367	4	a	where's alyssa ? 
32368	4	a	oh . 
32369	1	a	 i have yet another sales order for you to sign . 
32370	1	a	 why thank you mr . schrute . i don't know how you do it . you're a god . rick-a-dick-dick-doo . 
32371	0	a	 hi dwight . 
32372	1	a	you're back . and you're disgusting . 
32373	0	a	well , well , well , look who it is .

32375	0	a	hey ! sweetheart ! i have missed you so much . 
32376	0	a	 i have been dreaming of this moment . 
32377	1	a	hey , burning man , if it's not selling out too much , you might want to throw on a tie . david wallace is gonna be here in an hour . 
32378	0	a	obviously , that's why i'm here . i mean , i came back early to surprise erin . happy valentine's day , sweetheart . but , i'm just saying , i'm also excited about the wallace meeting . 
32379	1	a	no . please . come on , clark . wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months . right ? wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months ? 
32380	0	a	i have no idea . i don't know what he knows or doesn't know . but we've been in touch the whole time . i mean , it's not hard to get high-speed internet in turks de caicos , people . it's in every bembe cafe . 
32381	0	a	question . where's jim ? 
32382	0	a	for two hours ? really ? 
32383	0	a	if the shoe fits . 
32384	2	a	well , i mean , that's ok . it doesn't mean that it's over . right ? i mean , couples fight . 
32385	4	a	 yeah . 
32386	2	a	what ? 
32387	2	a	crying ? 
32388	0	a	i noticed that you landed the scranton white pages account . that is tremendous . 
32389	1	a	thank you . 
32390	0	a	and you sold it to jan too . 
32391	1	a	yes ! 
32392	0	a	i mean . . . i'm impressed . 
32393	1	a	 yeah ! 
32394	0	a	well , there's one problem . couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office . so . . . gotta run that stuff by me , dwight . 
32395	1	a	you were on a boat . 
32396	0	a	i was . . . 
32397	1	a	on a boat . 
32398	0	a	that . . . 
32399	1	a	in the ocean . 
32400	0	a	ok . the issue is that you need to run this stuff by me . coolio ? are we coolio ? just say the word 'coolio' . 
32401	1	a	i'm not gonna say it . 
32402	0	a	say it . 
32403	1	a	not a word . 
32404	0	a	coolio . 
32405	1	a	no ! what do you think you're doing ? 
32406	0	a	just gonna call the scranton white pages and clear this right up . 
32407	1	a	don't you dare ! andy ! 
32408	0	a	hey , jan . nard dog here . 
32409	0	a	i was just looking over the paperwork . i found a little hiccup . 
32410	0	a	yeah . it appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to . 
32411	1	a	 coolio . 
32412	1	a	coolio . coolio . 
32413	0	a	no . no , no , no jan i think you misunderstood . 
32414	1	a	coolio . 
32415	0	a	it , it's , it's actually just an issue . . . 
32416	1	a	no , jan ! please do not listen to this boob ! remember clark . he gave you everything . everything . 
32417	0	a	jan , i don't know what he's talking about but . . . 
32418	0	a	well , ah , ah . . . 
32419	1	a	please ja , ja . . . 
32420	0	a	aw ! that was not how i had hoped that would go . 
32421	0	a	 hey , everybody , great job . listen , we're a smidge behind on my paychecks . 
32422	0	a	all right . thank you very much . looking good . who's that little fella ? 
32423	0	a	wow , that's wonderful ! 
32424	0	a	uh-huh . 
32425	0	a	uh-huh . . . uh-huh . thank you . great . well , we're all up to speed . 
32426	1	a	two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen . 
32427	1	a	god ! i just don't know what we'd do . i mean , short of telling david wallace that he was gone for three months . 
32428	1	a	i'd like to rat out andy . unfortunately , i have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with david wallace . except , instead of a boy , i'm a man . and instead of a wolf , i cried genetically-engineered monster wolf . 
32429	1	a	fine ! the state he's in , wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway . 
32430	0	a	 what's going on in here , dirty players ? let's get back to busting some paper rhymes . come on . who's that girl ? who's that girl ? it's andy ! all right . back to work . 
32431	4	a	ok , i can tell you're mad at me . do you wanna just , um , i don't know , tell me why ? 
32432	2	a	i don't know . i thought that was a little weird . you told me brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing . and you intentionally left out a kind of major , intimate detail . i don't know , pam , i guess i just feel like a chump . who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy . 
32433	4	a	i didn't tell you about the crying because i didn't want you to know how upset i was . because it would've stressed you out and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress . 
32434	2	a	yeah , well . yeah , ok . well , then thank you . thanks to both of you . 
32435	4	a	it's not brian's fault . 
32436	2	a	no , you're right . and , and i'm not mad at brian . and to be honest , i probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because i wasn't there . so , let's just forget about it . 
32437	4	a	ok . 
32438	0	a	i need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case david asks . just a few things i could sprinkle into conversation . any big sales or office gossip . 
32439	1	a	well , we had the scranton white pages . 
32440	0	a	not helpful . let's stay positive , people . ok ? 
32441	0	a	hey ! david ! how are ya ? ah , we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other . not gonna lie , i get as much out of it as they do . 
32442	0	a	thank you . 
32443	0	a	great ! 
32444	0	a	 we had to let a warehouse guy go ? ! 
32445	1	a	 ' lit the whole thing on fire . it was crazy . 
32446	0	a	what ? ! 
32447	1	a	yeah . 
32448	0	a	there was a fire in the warehouse ? 
32449	1	a	the whole thing is in ashes . fire department was here . it was in all the papers . 
32450	0	a	this is what i'm talking about ! this would be good to know . all right , what else ? 
32451	0	a	what ? ! 
32452	0	a	no kidding ? 
32453	0	a	wow . go kathy . she's like 50 . 
32454	0	a	good , good . what else ? 
32455	0	a	who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative ? and thank god , right ? we needed the income after the fire . 
32456	0	a	the warehouse fire . weren't you just down there ? it's like burnt to ashes . 
32457	0	a	 i am speaking metaphorically , of course . you know i have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire . well , that's one of them . you know , making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled , properly-stoked fire . 
32458	0	a	i think you'll agree i explained that pretty well . 
32459	0	a	thank you . 
32460	0	a	yeah , i guess . 
32461	0	a	yeah , it just sort of sounds like noise to me now . you think i need a new fish ? 
32462	0	a	what ? 
32463	0	a	ok , i get it . you're unhappy . i've been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju . but , you and me , we have a future . there is a lot of love here . 
32464	0	a	on your side . but there's tons on my side . it's gushing . we're just out of sync right now . but that's just timing , it's timing . i mean , my parents lasted 38 , 40 years . they were never happy at the same time . 
32465	0	a	i mean , what do we have left ? 35 , maybe 40 years ? if we're lucky . i mean , i have spent a lot of time in the sun . 
32466	0	a	i'm gonna be a prune in like , 3 years . 
32467	0	a	i know you may not be feeling love for me right now but , if you fake it , i won't be able to tell the difference . so , i'll feel good . and then , eventually , maybe , you'll actually start to love me again . 
32468	0	a	yes . come on . totally . 
32469	2	a	you know what ? maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight . 
32470	4	a	oh ? 
32471	2	a	yeah . i just feel like i got a bunch of stuff to do in philly and i'm sure you have stuff to do . so we can just . . . i don't know , drop me at the bus station ? 
32472	4	a	are you sure ? 
32473	2	a	i just feel like we're gonna fight . 
32474	4	a	 yeah . 
32475	2	a	so . . . how 'bout let's not ? 
32476	4	a	ok . 
32477	2	a	oh , um . happy valentine's day . sorry , i didn't have time to wrap it . 
32478	4	a	 wow . i didn't know you kept this . 
32479	2	a	yeah , yeah . 
32480	4	a	thank you . 
32481	2	a	no problem . 
32482	4	a	i don't think you should go to philly tonight . i think that you should stay and i think we should fight . 
32483	2	a	you really wanna fight on valentine's day ? 
32484	4	a	yeah , i do . 
32485	2	a	ok . all right , put your dukes up , beesly .

32492	0	a	this has been a really tough time . 
32493	0	a	yeah . 
32494	0	a	erin just dumped me and i can't remember any of the aha moments i had on the boat , and i know it sounds weird to say but i really miss my beard .

32504	0	a	 ok , we ready ? don't use that part . last week , erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me . now i have to see her everyday at work . which is . . . brutal . when people say office relationships are a good idea , they never talk about what might happen if you break up . 
32505	0	a	 ahhh ! oooooh ! ahh
32506	4	a	he sounds like a wounded animal .

32513	1	a	you have no idea . i mean her hair , clothes , it's all falling off in great big clumps . and we need someone to go out there and clean her up . we had a nurse , but she quit because she was 'poisoned' by aunt shirley . 
32514	1	a	probably nothing , or strychnine . or lemonade and strychnine . which is actually what it was . 
32515	1	a	thank you . 
32516	1	a	angela . you owe me one , remember ? now please , she's an old woman angela . she needs a woman's touch . it's all hanging out-
32517	1	a	and there's parts of her i don't even recognize . 
32518	1	a	there's this one hanging part in particular , that's some sort of flap . 
32519	1	a	it's like a prehensile wing or something , you know ? 
32520	1	a	it's a divet . . . 
32521	1	a	 . . where it was and it needs , it needs a . . .

32525	1	a	how dare you ? 
32526	0	a	i'm still the boss ! 
32527	0	a	the answer is yes . 
32528	0	a	are they from you ? 
32529	0	a	well then , i don't want them . you can keep 'em . in fact , you can keep that big blue nautica sweater , i know how much you love it . 
32530	0	a	nope , i insist upon it . it's an awesome sweater . some great memories tied up in that thing . 
32531	0	a	i don't want to talk about work right now . 
32532	0	a	then i want my big blue sweater back . 
32533	0	a	she got rid of it . my blue sweater . what is that about ? 
32534	0	a	stay ! we are in the bro-zone layer . ok ? nard dog , plop and clarker posey , aka clarkwork orange . here's the sitch: erin dumped me , natch . but she got rid of my blue sweater , which was her favorite . is she moving on a little fast , or am i being a total psycho ? plop , you go first .

32536	0	a	last night i ordered a pizza by myself and i ate it over the sink like a rat .

32546	1	a	it keeps her docile . go to the kitchen , get the largest receptacle you can find . 
32547	0	a	why doesn't erin seem sad ? has she found someone new or something ? and if so , why hasn't she told me ? is she trying to spare my feelings ? during breakups , the mind goes to some crazy dark places . 
32548	0	a	i'm not snooping , there's just some crud on her screen . 
32549	0	a	uh , hello ! who's snooping on who now ? 
32550	0	a	everyone please , just-

32642	0	a	awkward . 
32643	0	a	 really uncomfortable situation . 
32644	0	a	it's alright pete , you can handle it . i mean we all just gotta 'move on' . ain't that right professor lecture much ? uh , question . how's that medicine taste ? your own flavored ? is it just me or have these tables turned ? hmm . hmm . 
32645	1	a	and you look like one too . thank you angela . 
32646	1	a	by all means . and i will carve the roast skunk . angela ? 
32647	1	a	would you like the stink sack ? 
32648	1	a	no , you don't eat it . it's a toy , like a wish bone . you know , prettiest girl gets the stink sack . 
32649	4	a	hello ? 
32650	2	a	hey ! back here . 
32651	4	a	oh , wow . seriously ? oh my gosh , is that champagne ? 
32652	2	a	si , senor . 
32653	4	a	oh , jim i should have told you i didn't get the job . 
32654	2	a	oh man . i'm so sorry . are you alright ? 
32655	4	a	oh , yeah . i'm more than alright . there's just nothing to celebrate . 
32656	2	a	are you kidding ? we're in philly . we're having dinner together . and this is just consolation champagne . it's from the part of france that immediately gave up to the nazis . here . 
32657	4	a	 you're very quick on your feet . i remember you . funny . 
32658	2	a	alright . so , tell me all about it . 
32659	1	a	ok . well , gosh . thank you for your help today . your perspective was very useful . thank you . 
32660	1	a	right . not outside . the horseflies . you know what ? my farm is only a few acres east of here . or , we could use the slaughterhouse . 
32661	1	a	leave him . he probably won't even notice that you're gone . be with me , monkey . 
32662	1	a	i'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse . we have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together . the eighty or ninety years that i have left in this life . . . i want to spend with you . 
32663	1	a	stand by your man . it's what i would want if you were mine . 
32664	0	a	hey , love turds . conference room , now . 
32665	0	a	thank you all for coming in . just wanted to check in . how is everyone's day ? 
32666	0	a	really ? hmm . that's interesting . because erin and pete thought it wouldn't be weird at all . why do you think it was weird , gabe ? maybe because you and erin used to be an item ? 
32667	0	a	and alice , uh , i understand you once dumped pete , ouch . 
32668	0	a	we'll get to that . gabe , did erin ever tell you that she loves you ? 
32669	0	a	alright , yes . that is a legitimate question . does making erin and pete feel bad make me feel better ? yeah . yeah , it does . 
32670	4	a	so , imagine like the real estate version of michael scott and that was this guy . he did half the interview as ace ventura . 
32671	2	a	tell me about the cologne . how much ? 
32672	4	a	oh , uh , entire bottle . at least . 
32673	2	a	you're definitely hoarding this by the way . 
32674	4	a	guess what poster he had on his wall ? 
32675	2	a	austin powers . 
32676	4	a	mmmm . 
32677	2	a	ferris bueller . 
32678	4	a	mmmm . you're getting colder . 
32679	2	a	not night at the roxbury . 
32680	4	a	 no . the odd life of timothy green . 
32681	2	a	i'm sorry , how did you think i was expected to guess that ? 
32682	4	a	i don't know , but it's interesting right ? 
32683	2	a	it's fascinating . 
32684	4	a	he said he can't help but tear up when he looks at it . it's like right next to his desk . he must look at it twenty times a day . 
32685	2	a	that's amazing . well , listen . you can't win 'em all , right ? 
32686	4	a	mmhm . 
32687	2	a	so , next interview has to be better . 
32688	4	a	i don't know . 
32689	2	a	what do you mean ? of course it will . you're amazing . 
32690	4	a	i know . it's just even if it was , a great boss and a great job , i just , i don't know , i don't know if i want , um , i don't know if i want this . 
32691	2	a	 huh . this is a little out of left field . 
32692	4	a	is it ? i just , i liked our life in scranton . 
32693	2	a	and i have started a business in philadelphia . 
32694	1	a	 hold it ! 
32695	1	a	i am dressed according to the schrute codes of mourning . my aunt shirley has died . 
32696	4	a	oh , dwight . i'm so sorry . were you guys close ? 
32697	1	a	i would say that she raised me , but let's not kid each other . i raised myself . she was , however , the closest thing i had to a mother . 
32698	1	a	my actual mother was very cold and distant . i'd say she was the closest thing i had to an aunt . 
32699	2	a	my condolences . 
32700	1	a	keep them . 
32701	2	a	ok . now , what do we got in these two pails ? 
32702	1	a	in keeping with schrute custom , i will either invite you to saturday's funeral by sprinkling red , fertile dirt in your face . or , i will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief , with a dusting of black , slightly acidic soil . 
32703	1	a	excuse me ? 
32704	1	a	ok . that's not . . . 
32705	2	a	 i'm sure . . . i'm sure she's in a better place . 
32706	1	a	i really hope so . 
32707	2	a	ok . this is crazy . you can't make a dirt ball . 
32708	1	a	i miss her so much . 
32709	2	a	ok . 
32710	1	a	you know ? 
32711	1	a	zeke . 
32712	1	a	are you going ? 
32713	1	a	 get in the sidecar . get in the sidecar . 
32714	1	a	get . . . 
32715	1	a	 what are you doing here ? 
32716	1	a	 oh , yeah . 
32717	1	a	jeb , my brother . 
32718	1	a	uh-huh . 
32719	4	a	' bad . 
32720	4	a	todd , you're just saying insults in the form of an apology . 
32721	4	a	i think it's called 'nibbles' . 
32722	4	a	hey , hey , guys . wait . before we accept these cupcakes , i think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room . don't eat the cupcake . 
32723	1	a	doesn't matter . it's a cemetery . 
32724	1	a	well , the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies . 
32725	1	a	well , thank god they're not because we don't want to make zombies . 
32726	1	a	you had black hair and then gray hair . 
32727	1	a	you were late . so , what am i supposed to do ? 
32728	1	a	 hello , little man . haven't seen you in a few years . what is this ? oh , god . henry . 
32729	1	a	i see esther's back in town . 
32730	1	a	hi esther . nice of you to come today . 
32731	1	a	well , if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion , why use two motions to slaughter those chickens . 
32732	1	a	ok . 
32733	1	a	so , let's get it going . 
32734	1	a	we schrutes don't need some harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead . but , there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers . and , when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins , we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead . out of kindness . 
32735	4	a	i don't think we should eat packers' cupcakes . we can't give him the satisfaction . 
32736	4	a	we can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes . he was awful to us . and , he still is . how much is a cupcake ? $2 . 50 ? is that the price of our dignity ? 
32737	4	a	would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from supermart ? 
32738	4	a	so , it really is just about the cupcakes . 
32739	0	a	wow , you're right . it is just about the cupcakes . 
32740	1	a	 thank you . 
32741	1	a	i can't stand the fact that jeb is a pot farmer . he could've grown anything . anything in the world . he used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid . one plant , one sandwhich . 
32742	1	a	let's do this . let's run aunt shirley's farm . i'm in . boom . 
32743	1	a	of course you are . 
32744	1	a	oh my god . 
32745	1	a	you know what ? let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about aunt shirley's offer . 
32746	1	a	you will say 'yes' on one . five , four , three , two , get ready to say 'yes' , one . yes . 
32747	1	a	ok . 
32748	1	a	oui . 
32749	1	a	 people underestimate the power of nostalgia . if baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport , then i can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm . nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses . second only to the neck . 
32750	4	a	kevin , um , let's think of something to distract us . uh , like the movie skyfall . you loved the movie skyfall , right ? 
32751	4	a	yes . he was a good spy . 
32752	4	a	guys , i'm proud of us . i think we did the right thing . hey ! 
32753	4	a	 wait ! 
32754	4	a	no , no . it's the principle of the thing . 
32755	0	a	 oh my god . i forgive him so much . whoa , is he choking ? 
32756	1	a	yes , very . you really need to stand back because these are killer chickens . 
32757	1	a	which is fine . and , you learned something . but , it was kind of a stupid question so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit . 
32758	1	a	if you want . 
32759	1	a	this ? no . that'd be cool , though . it's for milking . 
32760	1	a	did you just ask me if this was a cow ? 
32761	1	a	come here . come on . grab a teat with each hand . sit down . there you go . squeeze from top to bottom . really pull . use some muscle . draw the milk out . all right . going all right ? 
32762	1	a	well , is the udder hot ? is the milk clumpy ? 
32763	1	a	ok , you suck at this . give me those teats . didn't your father teach you anything ? 
32764	4	a	good morning , erin . 
32765	4	a	hey , everybody . um , i decided to eat my cupcake . i thought about it last night . i talked to jim . i talked to my sister . and , i think that , as long as todd packer doesn't know , it's ok . 
32766	4	a	phyllis ! 
32767	4	a	no ! 
32768	4	a	oh my god ! is everyone ok ? 
32769	0	a	last night ? oh , god , um , i don't know . na , nothing really . kevin ? 
32770	0	a	i'm not , a . . . i'm just . i don't know . oh . gosh . i actually . it is hard to recall . um . pretty normal night . 
32771	0	a	yeah . i didn't see you last night at all . 
32772	4	a	wow . he is officially the worst human being . 
32773	4	a	but , kevin that's . . . 
32774	2	a	ooh , red velvet . i should apologize too . 
32775	1	a	it . that kid doesn't put in some farm time , he's gonna stay like that . 
32776	4	a	phyllis has gotten into audio books and lately she's been listening to 50 shades of grey . which , if you don't know what it is , it's a book about um . . . 
32777	4	a	yeah . 
32778	1	a	 seriously . ugh . ok , this is unacceptable . it's officially a hostile work environment . 
32779	4	a	be careful . i pulled my mom's dog off a pillow once , and i got bit . 
32780	0	a	what ? 
32781	1	a	phyllis is masturbating . in the office right now as we speak . 
32782	0	a	whoa , whoa , whoa , wait a minute . why is phyllis so aroused ? 
32783	4	a	she's listening to 50 shades of grey . 
32784	0	a	well there you go . that's muy caliente . 
32785	1	a	ok , you are useless . i'll take care of this . 
32786	1	a	it's ok guys , she's no longer horny . 
32787	0	a	excuse me , dirty birdie 
32788	0	a	you can have this back at the end of the day . oh ! ! 
32789	1	a	clark , i need your advice . i'm having some lady troubles . 
32790	1	a	esther ruger . 
32791	1	a	lives on the neighboring farm . 85 acres . 
32792	1	a	well , we've been out three times , there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog , next thing i know he wants to lease a tractor with me . 
32793	1	a	 what do you think ? 
32794	1	a	a long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship . 
32795	4	a	 cici has been calling me 'pamela' . like four times this week . 
32796	2	a	oh man . 
32797	4	a	i wonder if she'll start calling you 'jim' . 
32798	2	a	oh boy , please don't . let's not let that happen . 
32799	4	a	 um . 
32800	2	a	what was i gonna- what was i gonna say ? 
32801	4	a	you're- you know your assistant told me that you have a big pitch meeting today . with ryan howard . how did that happen ?

32924	1	a	stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call . 
32925	0	a	 i hate people ! why do they never do what you need them to do ? stanley has to go . that's final . 
32926	1	a	so what i'm hearing you say is , 'make stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible' ? 
32927	0	a	yes ! i'm sorry i'm being curt , it's just i'm about to land a top talent agent . 
32928	1	a	mm-hmm . good luck . 
32929	0	a	 directory ? movie star department . back . directory . 
32930	1	a	for five years i've held my instincts in check because i wanted to be made manager . maybe it's time for me to just let that thought go . it's kind of painful , but it's also freeing in a way . now it's all about my instincts . 
32931	1	a	stanley , one way or another , you are gonna come with me to make this sale . 
32932	1	a	don't worry , it's just a bull tranquilizer . nothing to be alarmed about . it's just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker . 
32933	1	a	it's all right . andy approved it . 
32934	1	a	okay , this dosage was meant for a very small bull , and stanley's got way more body fat than they do . 
32935	1	a	shh . got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to . grab his feet . let's go ! 
32936	1	a	move it ! one , two , three . 
32937	1	a	he's like a manatee . ready ? let's go again . come on . we can do this . one , two , three ! oh , god . �� no wonder my elevator cables are under such strain . 
32938	1	a	yes . 
32939	1	a	 okay , we're good . we're good . let's go . push ! 
32940	1	a	i might see a movie . 
32941	1	a	what about you ? 
32942	1	a	 let's take him'
32943	1	a	let's go right to the top of the stairs , okay ? 
32944	1	a	okay , listen . i'm kind of embarrassed to admit this , but i've never actually done this before . 
32945	1	a	thank you . i mean , i've rehearsed it in my head like 1 , 000 times , but , uh'
32946	1	a	i know . evel knievel . 
32947	1	a	okay , now here's the plan . i'm gonna launch him . i need you to go to the bottom and catch him . 
32948	1	a	yeah . 
32949	1	a	you use your hands and just blunt his descent , okay ? he's gonna be moving slowly . it's only'
32950	1	a	it's 15 feet down , it's at a 45-degree angle . get set in your haunches , it's like your catching a medicine'
32951	1	a	okay . good call . he would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall . 
32952	1	a	 you okay ? 
32953	2	a	so how does it work ? it's like , you know , the action of talking to a third party breaks up the log jam , or'
32954	2	a	mm-hmm . 
32955	4	a	he took this job in philly without telling me . he bought our house without telling me . at a certain point , he��shouldn't��be rewarded for that . 
32956	2	a	if i didn't do certain things without telling pam , she'd be married to roy . 
32957	4	a	i feel like he's always making these decisions for the family , and then i'm left playing catch-up . 
32958	2	a	if she can just hang on for a little while longer , i'this will be so huge for our family . 
32959	2	a	what do you mean ? 
32960	2	a	that's kind of an impossible question . 
32961	0	a	huh , yeah . i mean , i'm happy angela's the first one getting famous , but it's a little weird , no ? i mean , she can't sing or act , so it's actually kind of insane , if you think about it . 
32962	0	a	yeah , we get it , phyllis , she looks like a freakin' movie star ! 
32963	0	a	come on ! 
32964	1	a	almost there . almost there . okay . we're running late . let's get him inside . 
32965	1	a	are you kidding me ? the bubble wrap is the only thing that's stopping his suit from getting wrinkled . these meetings are all about presentation . 
32966	1	a	thank you . 
32967	1	a	let's get him inside . 
32968	0	a	carla fern is not just an actor's agent . she does writers , directors , travel , and real estate . 
32969	0	a	actor ? 
32970	0	a	yeah , wow , cool . is it hard to train them to do that ? 
32971	0	a	does anything go on top of the mouse ? 
32972	0	a	aw , that's cute . 
32973	0	a	what's the mouse's name ? 
32974	1	a	well , i'll grab the forelegs , and you push his hindquarters . 
32975	1	a	fine , let's go . 
32976	1	a	hoist his shank on three . 
32977	1	a	it's by the tenderloin . 
32978	1	a	roll him , roll him , roll him . good . good . okay , careful , he's slouching . okay , can you'sl-slouch him into the seat . here . here . go around and get his seatbelt . 
32979	1	a	got it ? 
32980	1	a	 get in the back . 
32981	1	a	get in the back . 
32982	1	a	get in . 
32983	1	a	okay , stanley ? do you understand what we're about to do ? 
32984	1	a	oh , god , this is bad . looks like we've got no choice . you , my friend , are going to have to be stanley hudson . 
32985	1	a	new plan , okay ? we get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan . let's go ! gimme a hand . here we go . come on , stanley ! here we go . upsie-doozie . there we go . okay , all right . come on , big guy . you can walk , right ? yeah . what a pretty smile . let's go . 
32986	4	a	i'm sure athlead will be a huge success . but i don't want him to do it anymore , and i don't want to give him an ultimatum , but i am not moving our family to philly . 
32987	2	a	well , if pam says she won't go , then' we're gonna need a lot more than counseling . hmph . 
32988	1	a	and for'oh , whoopsie daisy . 
32989	1	a	he's fine . he gets carsick really easily . 
32990	1	a	it's a long drive . he was in the backseat . but right now we're talking to mrs . davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates , right , stanley ? 
32991	1	a	stanley . 
32992	1	a	look at him . i've never seen such a beautiful child . 
32993	1	a	like this ? watch . 
32994	1	a	 right ? come on ! 
32995	1	a	yeah , maybe i'll never be manager , but i just managed to get our most stubborn salesman to close a sale with one of our biggest clients , and i must say , it's the most pleasant i've ever seen stanley . i think we should consider injecting him with bull tranquilizer on a daily basis . 
32996	0	a	 well , what can't i do ? right , i can sing , i can dance , i can play the banjo , innit ? and if you hadn't noticed , i've got a pretty good british accent . 
32997	0	a	at the risk of sounding arrogant , i did drive myself here . 
32998	0	a	my exact age is 28 to 34 , so basically just send me out on whatever jake gyllenhaal's going out on . 
32999	0	a	: yes . and yes . 
33000	0	a	whereas that is not why i have entered show business , i do understand that you have to build credibility . i'm all for it . 
33001	0	a	well , at least i tried . thank you very much . 
33002	0	a	you are ? yes ! yes . are you being for real right now ? oh , man . ah , yes ! i need this so bad . i really think this is what could fix me . 
33003	0	a	most talent agents take 10% of whatever jobs they get you , but with carla you pay a flat rate of $5 , 000 up front . and that includes headshots . 
33004	0	a	it doesn't include headshots . 
33005	0	a	well , of course not , because that would be insane if it did . still getting a bargain , though . 
33006	1	a	you earned yourself a nice , fat commission and you didn't even know it . i'll go tell andy the good news . oh . silly me . gotta take the stairs . 
33007	1	a	well'no , no'n'
33008	1	a	 we need a winch and a hoist . 
33009	1	a	yesterday was the first round of a branch wide paper airplane contest . it was being sponsored by weyer-hammer paper in an effort to get us to sell more of their new product airstream deluxe a4 , the cadillac of paper . it's not so easy on the environment , if you know what i mean . practically made of plastic . 
33010	4	a	i didn't see you ! you should have yelled 'crossing ! '
33011	4	a	ok , so is that my spot ? 
33012	0	a	 be careful of that beaker , it contains dangerous acid ! 
33013	0	a	well i'm just trying to bring some life to it . 
33014	0	a	last week i got an agent and uh , this week i got a movie . hrpdc chemical handling protocols . it's gonna be seen by tons of workers in the industrial chemical community . one of whom could have a cousin whose brother's brad pitt . and boom , next thing you know , i'm in moneyballs two . 
33015	0	a	go away , we're running lines . 
33016	0	a	oh yeah . alright , get over here . i am so freaked out by things going into eyes . i just- wow . uggggh ! i can't even , i'm so freaked out by that , just go . go go go go go . 
33017	0	a	yeah , ok . alright . where were we ? 
33018	0	a	and remember: do not attempt to extinguish a chemical fire with water . you will only exacerbate the flame . the dangerous flame . 
33019	0	a	w-w-w-wait . stop stop stop . don't go anywhere . i just need to find more colors . let's do it six more times . 
33020	2	a	hey . i just wanted to say that you woke up early with the kids and let me sleep and i really appreciate that . 
33021	4	a	thank you . i appreciate that you appreciate that . 
33022	4	a	so , we had couple's therapy . 
33023	2	a	no shame in that . get it all out in the open . 
33024	4	a	and we have homework . 
33025	2	a	yes , we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices . because i need to appreciate what pam's been doing to run the house while i'm in philly . 
33026	4	a	and we're also supposed to speak our truths . 
33027	2	a	mmhm . 
33028	4	a	because if i had spoken my truth sooner about not wanting to move to philly , then maybe we wouldn't have had this opportunity for couple's therapy . 
33029	2	a	oh , we're supposed to call everything we don't want to do 'opportunities . '
33030	0	a	heads up everyone . if you really need something from me today , let's get it done tomorrow . carla fern got me a gig . 
33031	4	a	hey ! 
33032	0	a	yeah . 
33033	0	a	who is carla fern ? well , wow . uh , she's my agent and my drill sargent . and one of my best friends . oh , and oscar , i already figured it out . if i have to get emotional in the film , i'm just going to think about you getting dumped by the senator . 
33034	0	a	little raw . not cool oscar . 
33035	0	a	not cool . 
33036	1	a	i'm pumped ! 
33037	1	a	i offered myself to angela and she turned me down . if she changes her mind , the next move is hers . i'm with esther now . she's younger than angela , sturdier , more comfortable with the scent of a manured field . let's be honest . when it came to manured fields , angela was at best indifferent . 
33038	0	a	no . he's- i mean , you've never acted in anything before . he's just my entourage . 
33039	0	a	that's the cleaky clacker ! he clicks that and then the guy says 'action . '
33040	0	a	i guess it's starting . um , yeah . of course . yeah sure . tell you what . i'll put my arm around you and then i can take it-
33041	0	a	got it . 
33042	0	a	sorry . 
33043	1	a	hey , that is a really nice plane . you make that yourself ? 
33044	1	a	well , what am i thinking ? of course you made that yourself . cause it's in the rules that you have to fold your own plane . 
33045	1	a	i call for a refold ! 
33046	1	a	it's a piece of paper . you fold it into an airplane . 
33047	1	a	 whoo ! 
33048	2	a	an earl grey tea for the lady . 
33049	4	a	oh , thank you . i acknowledge and appreciate that you went out of your way to get me tea . 
33050	2	a	thank you . i like being appreciated . but , to speak my truth , it wasn't out of the way because i felt like a tea anyway . so , one trip . 
33051	4	a	well , to speak my truth , i switched to coffee in march . there's a new espresso machine . but i still acknowledge and appreciate the gesture . 
33052	0	a	 this video is to demonstrate the hprdc chemical handling protocols . these protocols could save you from severe injury , even death . 
33053	0	a	just made a character choice to be a scientist who really likes what he does and enjoys his job . 
33054	0	a	so how do you want , how should i do it ? 
33055	0	a	 this video is to demonstrate the hprdc chemical handling protocols . 
33056	0	a	it's tom brokaw , it's a newscaster . 
33057	0	a	tom brokaw ! 
33058	1	a	come on clark ! 
33059	1	a	whoa !

33063	1	a	what are you- you're here early . 
33064	1	a	i like a little feather in my nuggets . 
33065	0	a	which is insanely painful . 
33066	0	a	and i've already picked a few childhood memories to tap in to , to really express that pain . 
33067	0	a	so i just lean over this thing and then you'll add the water special effect later ? 
33068	0	a	i'm not comfortable doing my own stunts . i'll get nude if you want me to , i'll go full lena dunham but i-
33069	0	a	darryl , what do i do ? 
33070	0	a	they want me to use real water in the eye wash scene . 
33071	0	a	i can't squirt stuff in my eyeball . i've never even used an eye dropper . 
33072	0	a	carla ! carla ! 
33073	1	a	yes . i pity her . she was recently in a situation where she could have had it all , and instead she lost everything . 
33074	1	a	in a way . but not in a stand up and cheer kind of way , like the song . 
33075	0	a	she yelled at me . i can't wash my eyeball . i can't do that . i can't . 
33076	0	a	do you believe in me ? 
33077	1	a	 yeah ! ok ! beat that ! whoo ! ok . 
33078	4	a	oh , i made us a date to take my mom out to dinner to thank her for all that extra babysitting . 
33079	2	a	well , you know how much i appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more . so let me just put this in my calendar . 
33080	4	a	i acknowledge with gratitude that you are being kind and responsible enough to include it in your calendar . 
33081	2	a	thank you . your mom is a treasure . 
33082	4	a	well , i appreciate that some opportunities can be unpleasant- 
33083	2	a	hey that's work , hold on . hey wade , did cole hamels call back or what ? great . good . 
33084	4	a	uh , to speak my truth , i'd appreciate if you hung that up cause we were in the middle of a conversation . i appreciate the sacrifice . 
33085	2	a	ok to speak my truth , that was a little sarcastic . i think that's a little unfair . 
33086	4	a	really ? i've been putting the kids to bed by myself every night for a months . and you had to miss one phone call . is that your truth , jim ? that's really your truth ? 
33087	2	a	i guess i will swallow my truth .

33126	1	a	i had to find a new dojo after sensei ira and i parted ways . my new sensei , sensei billy , thought i had more than enough training to take the test . turns out , sensei ira was a bit of a shyster . sensei billy says most students don't spend $150 , 000 over 20 years to get their black belt . 
33127	1	a	i would like to invite you all to my black belt ceremony , right here in the office at lunch , lunch not provided .

33177	0	a	yeah , sure . what's your question ?

33328	1	a	oh , don't worry . they'll get got .

33333	2	a	sales form for you to sign . 
33334	1	a	you know what to do . ok

33338	2	a	no . 
33339	1	a	good call . together we run a no-nonsense office . 
33340	2	a	pre-conference room meeting with dwight went really well . 
33341	4	a	oh , bodes well for the post-conference room meeting . 
33342	2	a	all depends on the conference room meeting itself . uh , okay . 
33343	4	a	is that them again ?

33345	4	a	maybe you should call back ?

33347	2	a	the guys at athlead are still bugging me about this three month roadshow thing . meeting athletes on their home turf , building relationships . yeah , it sounds exciting . but i said no , and that's final . i almost lost pam over this business . i'm not risking that again . 
33348	4	a	when jim decided to come back to scranton full-time , i was relieved , but i also feel a little guilty . i mean , he's giving up this big thing for me . but he seems happy . i mean , he's certainly been goofing around a lot . i love goofy jim . 
33349	1	a	welcome . 
33350	2	a	he welcomes you . 
33351	1	a	please take an agenda item . 
33352	2	a	your agenda-taking pleases him . 
33353	1	a	have a seat , phyllis . there we go . as you know , i like to begin each day with an inspirational quote . 'some say the only failure there is is the failure to try . ' that is wrong . failure of any kind is failure . jim , over to you . 
33354	2	a	let's not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak , all right ? so , for instance , if you're expecting a fax today , please don't yell out , 'michael j . fax from fax to the future . ' ok ? that's nonsense . 
33355	4	a	question . 
33356	2	a	yes , beautiful girl in the front . 
33357	4	a	we are expecting a water delivery today at 10am . what if , as they're delivering the water jugs , someone screams out , 'nice jugs' ? 
33358	2	a	that's obviously nonsense . nonsense . and what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office ? 
33359	1	a	 what is going on ? 
33360	1	a	ok . um , new agenda item . phillip will be joining us in the office today . 
33361	2	a	gotta write that down . ok , big day today . airing of the documentary . who's excited ? 
33362	1	a	i'm letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary . so you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow , or a minute extra for the rest of the month . 
33363	0	a	this is really huge . this is like the march on washington but for a singing show . can you imagine if martin luther king were here ? and sang 'i dreamed a dream' from les mis ? with that baritone ? that would be historic . 
33364	0	a	no ! 
33365	0	a	no , this is my time ! you don't belt on my time ! i belt on my time . 
33366	0	a	 casey dean !

33371	1	a	hey , hey ! seriously ? 
33372	2	a	my god , i'm so sorry . well this might make up for it: i think i have found an enormous source of overlooked pfn . 
33373	1	a	which is , of course'
33374	2	a	potential future nonsense . 
33375	1	a	yes , good abbreviating , jim . that saved some time . now , hurry up , shut the door . break it down for me . 
33376	2	a	i'm gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile . you've got a regional manager . 
33377	1	a	the power source .

33382	2	a	exactly . 
33383	1	a	i'd have to get some more wire and string , but it's doable . do you think any of them out there are capable ? 
33384	2	a	yeah , right . i mean , unless they're willing to pass some tests . 
33385	1	a	i like the sound of that . who do you have in mind ? 
33386	2	a	well , i know this sounds crazy , but how would king arthur choose the next knight of his round table ? 
33387	1	a	that doesn't sound crazy , jim . that's the sanest thing i've ever heard . 
33388	0	a	hmm ? um , uh , locking in my starting note . a 440 . 
33389	0	a	a cappella is all about pitch , and i am nothing if not a total pitch bitch .

33405	2	a	this is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities . sure , every participant will be getting a corndog , but that's for fueling only . no savoring . 
33406	1	a	wow , the honor . god , i envy them . 
33407	2	a	he envies you .

33413	1	a	not even close , meredith . come on ! 
33414	2	a	okay , pam . what song is running through my head right now ? 
33415	4	a	theme song from saved by the bell . 
33416	2	a	oh , my god ! it was the theme song to boy meets world . 
33417	1	a	wait , no , no , no , stop . spouses can read each other's minds . you're trying to give your wife this job . 
33418	2	a	that's exactly what i was doing . plop , what animal am i picturing ? 
33419	2	a	ew , the exact opposite , actually . 
33420	2	a	come on . 
33421	2	a	whoa . how did you know that i was gonna'
33422	2	a	challenge number two , protocol . clark ? 
33423	2	a	do you want a corn dog ? 
33424	2	a	we'll see . you are an assistant who's just gotten a phone message . i am in a meeting with dwight , robert dunder , and his niece . uh-oh , look who came to join us . the turkish ambassador to armenia , yuri slovak , who , by the way , is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose . go ahead and read that phone message . 
33425	1	a	no , no , no , no ! you don't read it aloud like that ! god ! besides , the whole thing is a trick question . there's no turkish ambassador to armenia . the two countries don't have diplomatic relations . 
33426	2	a	uncanny . 
33427	0	a	great , more screen time for the war vet . all you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you . 
33428	0	a	what ? 
33429	0	a	is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit ? or is it a show about singing ? 
33430	0	a	me too . hold my place in line . 
33431	0	a	they want feel-good stories ? wait until they get a good feel of me . 
33432	4	a	darryl , hey . 
33433	4	a	cool , are you coming back to say hi ? 
33434	4	a	aha . how's athlead ? 
33435	4	a	wow . 
33436	4	a	he says he doesn't want to . 
33437	4	a	well , he seems really happy being back here at dunder mifflin . 
33438	4	a	that's what he says . 
33439	2	a	an assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity . but an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove , am i right ? 
33440	1	a	a thousand times more . 
33441	2	a	phyllis ! grab both these coffees , double-fist it , and head through this obstacle course . 
33442	2	a	yeah . it's real . it's the only way you'll learn . ok , and go ahead . oh , god , nice ! she's through the green , everybody . here comes yellow , real doozy . careful ! 
33443	1	a	 no , no , no ! phyllis , seriously ? 
33444	2	a	look at that form . 
33445	1	a	 oh , god , this is pathetic ! the boss needs his coffee ! augh ! ah ! here you are , sir ! here's your coffee ! ah , my skin , ow , ow ! it burns ! ah ! 
33446	2	a	uncanny . 
33447	2	a	you know , dwight , this whole search for the assistant thing'none of these people are good enough . 
33448	1	a	i know . 
33449	2	a	what i'm about to say makes no logical sense , and yet , it might be the most logical thing i've ever said . 
33450	1	a	jim , this is gonna come as no surprise but i know exactly what you are going to say . the only possible assistant to my assistant-
33451	2	a	is-
33452	1	a	me . 
33453	2	a	the new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is dwight k . schrute . 
33454	1	a	yes ! thank you . 
33455	2	a	i think you might want to kneel for this . and yet , the manager for dunder mifflin kneels for no one . that's it . you look really , really good . 
33456	1	a	okay , from now on , anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first , all right ? 
33457	2	a	hey . 
33458	4	a	hey . 
33459	2	a	you all right ? what's going on ? 
33460	4	a	are you happy ?

33465	2	a	what ? 
33466	4	a	what about five years from now ? 
33467	2	a	pam . 
33468	4	a	because i'm so glad you're back , baby , but i'm just'i was talking to darryl , and he was talking about the trip , and i just feel like you're giving up so much . 
33469	2	a	this was my decision , not yours . 
33470	4	a	okay . 
33471	2	a	you didn't force me . 
33472	4	a	i kind of forced you to do it . 
33473	2	a	you did not force me to do this . 
33474	4	a	yes , i did . 
33475	2	a	i don't know how else to tell you . 
33476	4	a	i'm afraid that you're gonna resent me and i'm afraid that'
33477	2	a	resent you ? 
33478	4	a	this is not enough for you and i'm afraid that i'm not enough for you . 
33479	2	a	is that really what you think ? 
33480	2	a	not enough ? i don't know how else to explain it to her , so , you know what ? i know it's against the rules but i'm gonna need a favor from you guys . 
33481	1	a	smart baby . that's the most flavorful bond . 
33482	0	a	hey , what's goin' on over here ? some sort of singing competition for the young'uns ? 
33483	0	a	no , it's me , andy ! 
33484	0	a	no , no , no . i'm wearing makeup . 
33485	0	a	oh , i took out my lifts . 
33486	0	a	yeah , unlike andy bernard , this character is my real height . 
33487	1	a	oink the pigs , that is very important . 
33488	1	a	the way that boy looks at the galactica is precisely the way i look at the galactica . and he eats the same kind of paper i do . hmm . 
33489	1	a	 thank you , esther . 
33490	2	a	you threw the summoning bag at me , sir ? 
33491	1	a	i need you to perform a test . 
33492	2	a	perform a test . 
33493	1	a	on an innocent baby . 
33494	2	a	ooh , i like where this is going . unfortunately i have a lot of work today so i'm gonna have to hand this off to my number two . but , don't worry , he's the best in the biz . 
33495	1	a	damn straight . 
33496	2	a	unless you think he can't handle it . 
33497	1	a	hey , he can handle it . 
33498	2	a	all right . 
33499	1	a	hey , you want me to take the little diaper blaster ? pam can attest , there's no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps . 
33500	4	a	he does have a gift . 
33501	1	a	okay . you ever been in a manager's office before ? 
33502	1	a	phillip , you wanna play a little game ? it's called 'schrute or consequences . ' you're gonna choose one of these two things . a check for a million dollars , or this dirty old beet . yuck , pew ! which will it be ? money or the beet ? 
33503	1	a	yeah . any ordinary child would have taken the money , but you're no ordinary child are you ? no . i can tell by your gorgeous , widely-set eyes . 
33504	0	a	whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , what ? 
33505	0	a	whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . you can't do that . you can't do that , we've all been waiting .

33507	0	a	don't'don't'
33508	0	a	don't touch me . 
33509	1	a	that is because this baby is of superior intelligence . he can tell when he's being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast . 
33510	0	a	 hi . you're still here . oh , thank god . clay aiken , santigold , aaron rodgers . you're like , my three favorite people ever .

33513	0	a	nope ! can't end like this . slept in my car last night , quit my job , burned all my bridges . i went to the bathroom on my boss's car . and i did unspeakable things with carla fern .

33520	2	a	 thank you . 
33521	1	a	door . chair . it's about phillip . 
33522	1	a	i believe that boy may be a schrute . and if he is , that child needs to be accorded what is his . an enormous farm , an inheritance , and the right to be raised under rigorous schrute traditions . you will , of course , be compensated with a marriage proposal . 
33523	1	a	then the two of you would move to my 1 , 600-acre estate , which , let's face it , is a big step up from living in a gay man's closet . 
33524	1	a	very well . 
33525	1	a	yes . 
33526	4	a	what is this ? 
33527	2	a	well i've been trying to tell you how i feel , and you wouldn't believe me , so i needed a little help .

33532	1	a	jim . i'm not kidding . i need you . 
33533	4	a	go ahead . 
33534	2	a	ok , um , this is' 'i'll be right back . 
33535	2	a	what do we got ? 
33536	1	a	i was thinking of proposing to esther today . 
33537	2	a	wow ! congratulations , that's a really big step . 
33538	1	a	she's got a ton of great qualities . she's young , she's beautiful , genes so pure you could lick them . her family admires me , my family tolerates hers . a lot of them are the same people because we're third cousins , which is great for bloodlines and isn't technically incest . 
33539	2	a	right in the sweet spot . i think you're gonna be really happy . 
33540	1	a	plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen , premium cattle sperm . 
33541	2	a	 that's a lot of pros . 
33542	1	a	and did i mention that she weaves ? colorful , durable blankets and rugs ! it all adds up . 
33543	2	a	so what is the problem ? 
33544	1	a	angela . 
33545	2	a	i don't know what you want me to tell you , man . all i know is that every time i've been faced with a tough decision , there's only one thing that outweighs every other concern . one thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew , every instinct , every rational calculation . 
33546	1	a	some sort of virus ? 
33547	2	a	love . 
33548	1	a	oh . 
33549	1	a	you're a good assistant , jim . 
33550	2	a	not as good as you . 
33551	1	a	that's very true . get the hell outta here . 
33552	2	a	you got it . 
33553	2	a	you watched it . 
33554	4	a	yeah . 
33555	2	a	well , then i guess you're ready for this . 
33556	4	a	what's that ? 
33557	2	a	it's from the teapot . everything you'll ever need to know is in that note . not enough for me ? you are everything .

33564	1	a	this expresses how loudly i love you . 
33565	1	a	 this is a ring , taken from the buttocks of my grandmother , put there by the gangster patriarch of the coors dynasty , melted in a foundry run by mennonites . 
33566	1	a	i love you ! 
33567	1	a	what ?

33578	1	a	go ahead and just read the frosting . 
33579	1	a	uh-huh . 
33580	1	a	it's a colloquial way of saying 'you're fired , ' kevin , which you are .

33582	1	a	the cake has spoken pam . sorry .

33590	2	a	 can you clap ! can you clap for mom ?

33593	4	a	i think she looks good . now that she's wearing sports bras , we don't see her boobs as much . 
33594	1	a	that is all . have a good morning . 
33595	1	a	 what was that for ? 
33596	1	a	ah . i know . it just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone . 
33597	1	a	oh , and the old man to feed us the cheese that he's been fermenting since the day of my birth . you keep forgetting about him .

33603	1	a	ever since angela moved in and mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed , he's been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing . 
33604	2	a	mose has been weird ? that's so unlike him . 
33605	0	a	yeah , sure , i'll talk about it . why not ? american's next a cappella sensation aired my audition . and when i started sobbing uncontrollably , apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people . not a very compassionate chord . the clip went viral , as they say
33606	0	a	oh , i can so just sit here and cry ! 
33607	0	a	two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started . one from the philippines got 12 million hits . and the late night comedy guys had a field day with it .

33787	0	a	thanks dad'darryl . 
33788	2	a	imagine going back and watching a tape of your life . you could see yourself change and make mistakes'and grow up . you could watch yourself fall in love , watch yourself become a husband , become a father . you guys gave that to me . and that's'an amazing gift . 
33789	2	a	thanks phyl . 
33790	2	a	i sold paper at this company for 12 years . my job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper . even if i didn't love every minute of it , everything i have , i owe to this job . this stupid'wonderful'boring'amazing job . 
33791	4	a	i thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary . but all in all'i think an ordinary paper company like dunder mifflin was a great subject for a documentary . there's a lot of beauty in ordinary things . isn't that kind of the point ?
