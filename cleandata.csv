133,"Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.",michael,13
134,"Pam, information is power.",dwight,4
136,"No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin.",michael,55

151,That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.,dwight,18
152,"It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules.",dwight,33
153,What is that?,michael,3
154,That is my stapler.,dwight,4

194,You got a fax.,pam,4
195,"Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.",michael,56

457,"[trying not to cry] All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority.",michael,25
461,"Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.",michael,38
463,What?,michael,1
465,"That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice.",michael,39
466,"[Pam is asleep, resting her head on Jim's shoulder] Um... Hey.",jim,11
467,[stirs] Mmmm.,pam,2
468,Hey.,jim,1
469,Oh.,pam,1
470,We can go.,jim,3
471,Sorry.,pam,1
472,That's fine.,jim,2
473,Uh... Not a bad day.,jim,5
498,"It would've been just as easy for him to spell insect. Of course, that wouldn't have made any sense either.",pam,20
509,"Yeah, um, there's good things about Michael. He uh, uh... Yeah, definitely. Um...",pam,13
533,Talk like you're talking to that race. I have a feeling that this could get kind of volatile. So keep it going. [camera shows Devon sitting outside with West Nile],michael,30
556,[Dwight's new race is 'Dwight'] I could be French.,dwight,9
557,"[takes his 'Dwight' race off his forehead] Damn it, Jim! That's not funny, Jim!",dwight,14
558,"Oh, okay. Here we go, breakthrough radar. What happened? What happened here?",michael,12
559,It didn't have anything to do with race.,pam,8
560,"Okay, all right. Let's keep on track. Keep on point. Let's do it.",michael,13
563,"Um, why did she slap Martin Luther King?",jim,8
564,"What, huh?",michael,2
565,What card was she?,pam,4
566,I think she wasn't wearing a card.,jim,7
567,It's good. This is good. We got it happening now. All right? Let's keep it rolling. Let's round it up.,michael,20
568,Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies.,michael,5
569,I'm not making any copies.,pam,5
570,"Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway.",michael,12
571,Nothing new.,pam,2
572,Lay them on me. What?,michael,5
573,There's nothing new.,pam,3
574,That's not what you said earlier.,michael,6
575,"Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the... [nods toward camera]",pam,19
578,"I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.",michael,26
580,I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan.,michael,14
582,"Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good.",michael,7
584,You gotta crack these things open.,michael,6
586,"Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice.",michael,18
588,"Well, it's a suicide mission, you know.",michael,7
590,"There, there...",michael,2
592,[scoffs] When have you ever done that?,michael,7
594,"Last night on Trading Spouses, there's... have you seen it?",jim,10
595,No. I have a life.,pam,5
596,"Interesting, what's that like?",jim,4
597,You should try it sometime.,pam,5
598,Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...,jim,10
599,[laughs]... your problem.,pam,3
600,Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.,michael,4
601,"There's a decision that needs to be made, and I'm having an unbelievably a busy day. So I'm going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.",michael,37
602,Gosh.,jim,1
603,Yeah!,michael,1
604,That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.,jim,16
605,Really?,michael,1
606,"Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?",jim,25
607,"Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.",jim,17
608,Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.,dwight,8
609,"Right now, this is just a job. If I advance any higher in this company then this would be my career. And uh, well, if this were my career, I'd have to throw myself in front of a train.",jim,39
610,"OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?",dwight,13
611,"Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan.",michael,8
612,"OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.",dwight,21
613,You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.,michael,10
614,"[to self] Yes, I have an office. [to camera] Bigger than his.",dwight,12
615,"Nope, you cannot use it.",michael,5
616,"OK, I take it back, it's a workspace.",dwight,8
617,Temporary workspace. You can use it.,michael,6
618,Thank you.,dwight,2
619,"If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already.",michael,54
620,What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.,dwight,30
621,"In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, 'Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead.' Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead.",dwight,38
623,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.",pam,5
624,"[on phone] Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks?",michael,7
625,Where are you?,pam,3
626,"Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there?",michael,38
627,"Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out 'cause the...",pam,18
628,"Pam! Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I'm getting a call.",michael,17
629,No you're not.,pam,3
630,"I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?",michael,41
631,OK.,pam,1
632,"Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.",michael,15
633,Still no one calling.,pam,4
634,"Dwight, what...",pam,2
635,"Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.",dwight,9
636,It says 'workspace'.,jim,3
637,Same thing.,dwight,2
638,"If it's the same thing, then why did you write 'workspace'?",jim,11
639,"Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.",dwight,11
640,You are not my superior.,jim,5
641,"Oh gee, then why do I have an office?",dwight,9
642,I thought it was a workspace?,jim,6
643,OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?,pam,13
644,Yes. And my decision in final.,dwight,6
645,This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.,pam,10
646,"Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.",dwight,8
647,"You cut more than you had to, didn't you?",jim,9
648,Sure.,dwight,1
649,"Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?",jim,14
650,Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.,dwight,9
651,"OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.",jim,13
652,"I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.",dwight,24
653,Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?,pam,8
654,So I can lower it.,dwight,5
659,"Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?",michael,13
661,"Ah, what? Which memo?",michael,4
662,Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.,pam,9
663,Is it a good plan?,michael,5
664,It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.,dwight,10
666,"Michael, he made huge cuts.",pam,5
667,"Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?",michael,8
668,"Yeah, you said...",dwight,3
669,"No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?",michael,34
670,I can handle that.,dwight,4
671,"OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?",michael,50
678,"Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, 'Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I...",michael,45
679,"OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.",dwight,53
680,"OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.",jim,16
681,"OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.",dwight,39
682,Workspace.,jim,1
683,You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.,michael,15
684,Where are you going?,pam,4
685,"Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. [Giggles] Couldn't find the knob.",michael,16
686,"So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.",michael,59
688,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so...",michael,6
689,Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.,jim,18
690,I'm inventing new diseases.,pam,4
691,"Oh, great.",jim,2
692,"So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?",pam,23
693,I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.,jim,12
694,Nice.,pam,1
695,Thank you.,jim,2
696,"[on his cell phone] Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.",michael,47
698,Its says here that it's a 300ft drop.,michael,8
700,So it's not a free fall?,michael,6
702,"Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?",michael,18
703,"OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?",michael,34
704,Damnit! Damnit Jim!,dwight,3
705,"All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.",dwight,21
706,What are you talking about?,jim,5
707,"Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.",dwight,11
708,"OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?",jim,16
709,"Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.",dwight,11
710,"You did this, didn't you?",dwight,5
711,Absolutely not.,jim,2
712,Yes you did.,dwight,3
713,No I didn't.,jim,3
714,"I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!",dwight,41
715,Killer nanorobots?,jim,2
716,It's an epidemic.,pam,3
717,"The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] 'Count Choculitis'",dwight,39
718,Sounds tough.,jim,2
719,Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?,dwight,16
720,Do you?,jim,2
721,I think you need to confess...,dwight,6
722,Mmm hmm.,jim,2
723,...the fact...,dwight,2
724,Yep.,jim,1
725,What are you doing? Those are my keys.,dwight,8
726,Good luck. [closes door and locks it],jim,7
727,"Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let... [Without looking, Jim throws his keys to his left, they land on a shelf next to Stanley]",dwight,26
729,[answering phone] Jim Halpert.,jim,4
730,Let me out.,dwight,3
731,Who is this?,jim,3
732,Let me out or you're fired.,dwight,6
733,"No, you can't fire me.",jim,5
734,Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk.,dwight,12
735,"OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep. [presses button on phone]] Jim Halpert.",jim,16
736,"[on phone] Hey, Jim. It's Pam.",pam,6
737,Hey Pam! How are you?,jim,5
738,Jim! Open the door!,dwight,4
739,"Good, how are you? Busy?",pam,5
740,I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?,jim,14
741,Jim!,dwight,1
742,"Um, I'm not bothering you, am I?",pam,7
743,"No, not at all.",jim,4
744,You don't have anything you're doing?,pam,6
745,I have nothing to do.,jim,5

748,Jim!,dwight,1
749,Oh yeah?,jim,2
750,I might go to the mall.,pam,6
751,The mall?,jim,2
752,Jim!,dwight,1
753,I need new shoes.,pam,4
754,"Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?",jim,6
756,"Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould.",dwight,11
758,"Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.",dwight,17
760,Dwight Schrute.,dwight,2
762,Well...,dwight,1
764,He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.,dwight,14
766,"That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.",dwight,16
768,Yeah.,dwight,1
770,"Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?",dwight,20
772,"Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your... [dial tone]",dwight,12
773,"Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh! [laughs] Here you go. Take one, take one. It's all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why don't you take two? Because you don't get health care. And uh, faster metabolism.",michael,47
775,"Why don't you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly.",michael,14
777,There you go.,michael,3
779,"Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it.",michael,25
780,Michael. Michael?,dwight,2
781,"[under his breath] Oh, Christ.",michael,5
782,"I tried being rational, OK? And what happened? The employees went crazy, I got no help from corporate. That leaves me with no options.",dwight,24
783,"I'm now going to read out loud your submitted medical conditions. When you hear yours read, please raise your hand to indicate that it is real. If you do not raise your hand, it will not be covered.",dwight,38
785,"You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis.",dwight,29
787,I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?,dwight,9
789,"OK, great. Dermatitis. Thank you Angela. I'll make sure that's covered. OK, now. Who wrote this, hysterical one? Anal fissures?",dwight,20
791,"Yeah, but no one here has it.",dwight,7
798,"Well, what? You could be referring to anything.",michael,8
800,Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.,pam,14
801,"Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?",michael,6
802,I most certainly did not.,dwight,5
803,"Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it? [looks at watch] Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.",michael,58
805,"Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?",michael,33
807,"All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!",michael,30
808,"When I am backed into a corner, that is when I come alive. See I learned improve from the greats, like, um, Drew Carey and Ryan Stiles.",michael,27
809,"[clapping hands] God, yeah... Ah! This...",michael,6
810,"Robin Williams. Oh, man, would I love to go head-to-head with him. Oh! That would be exciting. [as Robin Williams] 'Hi. I'm Mork from Ork.' Well, I'm Bork from Spork. Nanoo, nanoo. Jibelee, baloobaloo.",michael,34
811,"Oh, um... Jan wants you to call her.",dwight,8
892,Michael!?,dwight,1
893,"Oh! God. Dwight, come on...",michael,5
894,I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?,dwight,9
895,There's no downsizing.,michael,3
896,"I, but if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager?",dwight,12
897,Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.,michael,6
898,"Yeah, so I don't have to worry?",dwight,7
899,"Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing, okay?",michael,23
900,"But there's no downsizing, so just don't...",michael,7
901,Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?,dwight,8
902,"Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe.",michael,4
904,"It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.",dwight,34
906,"I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?",dwight,27
908,Who is it? Who's the birthday?,michael,6
909,"Um... Actually, we don't have any staff birthdays coming up.",pam,10
910,Next person on the...,michael,4
911,Oh.,pam,1
912,...calendar.,michael,1
913,"Okay, umm... that would be Meredith.",pam,6
914,"Yes! All right, come on down Meredith!",michael,7
915,But it's not until next month.,pam,6
916,"Um... uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, it'll be a surprise.",michael,12
917,You still want to have a party?,pam,7
918,"Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!",michael,23
919,"[grabs cell phone off desk] Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek.",michael,42
927,How about green?,pam,3
929,This was tough. I suggested we flip a coin. But Angela said she doesn't like to gamble. Of course by saying that she was gambling that I wouldn't smack her.,pam,30
930,These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing '80s party last year. Off the hook!,michael,16
931,"So I was thinking, if you haven't already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious.",michael,28
933,"She's not the only one that's going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It's not, uh, it's not just about her, so...",michael,27
934,It is... her birthday.,pam,4
935,"Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?",michael,12
936,"Hey, so listen, I was thinking that it might be a good idea if you and I formed an alliance. 'Cause of the downsizing? I think an alliance might be a good idea, you know. Help each other out.",dwight,39
937,"Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?",dwight,9
938,"Absolutely, I do.",jim,3
939,"Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected...",dwight,15
940,"At that moment, I was so happy. I mean, everything Dwight does annoys me.",jim,14
941,Did you get your tickets?,dwight,5
942,To what?,jim,2
943,The gun show. [Rolls up his sleeve and kisses his bicep],dwight,11
944,"And I spend hours thinking of ways to get back at him, but only in ways that could get me arrested. And then here he comes and he says 'No, Jim, here's a way.'",jim,34
945,There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone.,dwight,18
946,An alliance?,pam,2
947,Oh yeah.,jim,2
948,What does that even mean?,pam,5
949,"I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure.",jim,13
950,"Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.",jim,16
951,"Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?",dwight,16
952,Did you tell Pam about the alliance?,dwight,7
953,What? No.,jim,2
954,Just now.,dwight,2
955,"What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.",jim,22
956,"Right, that's good, good, pursue this.",dwight,6
957,Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?,jim,10
958,Mmm hmm.,dwight,2
959,"But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.",jim,32
960,Done.,dwight,1
961,All right.,jim,2
963,"They seem awfully chummy, don't you think?",dwight,7
964,"Yeah, what do you think that's about?",jim,7
965,Only one way to find out.,dwight,6
966,I'm on it.,jim,3
967,You are not going to believe this.,jim,7
968,What? I believe it.,dwight,4
969,"Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.",jim,7
970,"I could tell, from the body language.",dwight,7
971,"Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?",jim,9
973,"Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone...",jim,12
975,"Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off.",jim,10

1064,[box falls over] Oh.,dwight,4
1065,"Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal.",michael,20
1066,"Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?",jim,23
1067,"Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time.",michael,31
1068,"Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give.",jim,26
1069,Is Oscar around?,michael,3
1070,"I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn't think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so...",michael,27
1072,I know...,michael,2
1074,Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um...,michael,8
1076,"No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't... No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just... it... it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape?",michael,36
1078,How many miles did he do last year?,michael,8
1080,Son of a bitch. That is impressive.,michael,7
1081,Happy Birthday. [gives Meredith her card],pam,6

1084,[under his breath] I don't know about that.,michael,8
1086,"[pretends to vomit] Huh! Thanks, downer.",michael,6
1088,Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old.,michael,10

1099,"This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers?  I think we could have done better than that.",michael,21
1102,"OK, we... all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we're losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are... a group of people... who work together. I was... I really wasn't gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscar's nephew's... walkathon. $25.",michael,57
1104,"Per mile, yes.",michael,3

1109,"Come here. [hugs Oscar and In a low voice] Don't cash that till Friday, OK?",michael,15
1116,"OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.",jim,10
1117,"Oh, tell me, tell me.",pam,5
1118,OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... [Pam starts laughing]... spy on our other branch. No no no.,jim,25

1128,It's just office pranks.,pam,4
1129,"It's stupid. It's, it's just office pranks.",jim,7
1131,I have absolutely no idea.,dwight,5
1133,"Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.",dwight,27
1134,"[With blonde hair] That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.",dwight,26

1263,"Michael, I...",dwight,2
1264,"I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight.  All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.",michael,49
1265,I can handle that.,dwight,4
1266,"Good. Excellent, it'll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday.

2251,Bye.,pam,1
2252,"Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.",jim,8
2264,"The weird part about this whole deal this that Michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational. I mean, he puts more effort and time and commitment into the Dundies than anything else he does all year. Which is probably why this branch will be downsized.",jim,48
2289,"Angela, it's simple. Just tell me what the bathroom wall says.",dwight,11
2291,I'm not asking what you do in there. I just want to know what's written about Michael.,dwight,17

2295,"Well, what should I do, guys? Seriously, do you want me to just cancel the Dundies?",michael,16
2297,Ping? Everybody loves Ping. He's my most popular character.,michael,9
2299,"Really? Well, he is based on the Chinese delivery guy that I have, who talks exactly like that, so, I think you should take it up with him instead of me.",michael,31

2410,So the monkey does the sex thing right here! [monkey noises in background],dwight,13
2411,That's funny! That's funny. Not offensive. Uh... because it's nature. Educational.,michael,11
2412,Do you want the link because then you could forward it around?,dwight,12
2413,"Um, I...",michael,2
2414,Consider it?,dwight,2
2415,"Yeah... maybe. Maybe. Well, we'll see. Because I... I don't know if it's... [muffled by jacket over his head] Whup! Come on! Hey!",michael,23
2417,"Kay! Oh, you are so bad! Yeah!",michael,7

2446,You are?,pam,2
2447,My Mom is coming in to visit. And she lives like two hours away. And she doesn't have a cell phone... which is cool cause it's kind of adding some suspense to my day. And I keep looking over at the door hoping she'll walk in.,pam,46
2448,I've decided to show her around. She really wants to meet everybody.,pam,12
2449,Oh yeah?,jim,2
2450,mmhmm.,pam,1
2451,Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.,jim,8

2458,"Yes, Toby?",michael,2
2460,Um... literally two seconds?,michael,4
2461,Toby is in HR which technically means he works for Corporate. So he's really not a part of our family. Also he's divorced so he's really not a part of his family.,michael,32
2463,"No, no, Toby. No.",michael,4
2465,"It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!",michael,29

2469,NO!,michael,1
2471,"What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?",michael,25
2473,There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke.,michael,14
2474,"Everyone! Hello! Everyone. Hi! Sorry to interrupt. I know you're all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption. But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day. [to Toby] So, take it away.",michael,47
2476,"I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it.",michael,30
2477,"A guy goes to a five dollar... lady of the night and he gets crabs. So, the next day he goes back to complain. And the woman says 'Hey. It was only five dollars. What did you expect? Lobster?' This is what's at stake.",michael,44

2506,Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke.,pam,18
2507,She's coming in today and maybe just don't joke around about that stuff in front of her.,pam,17
2509,Thank you.,pam,2
2511,"Hi, is it over?",michael,4
2513,No.,michael,1

2519,Exactly! Mmwwah [blows kiss to Angela]! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?,michael,17
2521,"Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?",michael,58
2526,"I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.",michael,24
2527,"Yeah, Meredith.",dwight,2
2528,No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?,michael,10

2534,"I'm in an office relationship. It's special. Um... she's nice. She's shy. She's actually here. You want to meet her? Hold on one second. Oh, my God! Put on a shirt! Put on a... . I told you that you'd be on camera. I'm sorry, she's European. No, I told you that you'd be on camera. Stop it.",jim,58
2535,What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her 'partner' in to work? [to Toby] Would that be crossing the line?,michael,23
2537,What if they made out? In front of everybody?,michael,9
2539,At home? And I told everybody everything about it.,michael,9
2541,"Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam?",michael,25
2544,"No, thanks. I'm good.",jim,4

2572,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.",michael,16
2574,"Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.",michael,27
2576,"I don't have any DUI's so I can drive myself, but thanks.",pam,12
2578,"So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes.",michael,14
2580,"Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em.",michael,8
2581,"When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another.",michael,41
2583,The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything.,michael,14
2585,"Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan.",michael,7
2587,"No, I've seen the video.",michael,5
2589,"No, I didn't. [to Jan] Huh, what? [everyone looks up at blow-up doll]",michael,13
2591,Does that include 'That's What She Said'?,jim,7
2592,Mmmhmm. Yes.,michael,2
2593,"Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...",jim,23
2594,THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!,michael,4
2596,[laughing] Come on.,michael,3
2599,Mwah! [kisses hand and salutes office],michael,6
2601,You would have done the same. You just didn't think of it first.,michael,13
2603,It's... That's...,michael,2
2605,"Okay. [to man entering office] Hello. [introduces] Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.",michael,17
2607,I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.,michael,16
2609,This guy does it all.,michael,5
2611,What?,michael,1
2613,So I'm not in trouble?,michael,5
2614,"I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems.",michael,48
2615,"Okay. Well, let's get you out of here, James. Um... I think we're under an hour still, so...",michael,18
2617,I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.,michael,11
2619,[ecstatic] Oh my god!,pam,4
2621,Hello!,pam,1
2622,I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever.,pam,13
2624,Yeah. I'm in charge of this whole area.,pam,8
2627,This is where I used to keep my computer.,pam,9
2629,But then I moved it.,pam,5
2631,"Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So...",pam,19
2633,"So this is like, um, an organization station...",pam,8
2635,Hey!,pam,1
2641,"Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to killing time.",pam,23
2647,Mom!,pam,1
2649,No.,pam,1
2651,Ten minutes.,pam,2
2653,Then we can go to dinner.,pam,6
2657,"No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.",michael,8
2659,"Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.",michael,9
2661,"No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.",michael,31
2663,I don't know about that.,michael,5
2665,"Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point. [to Kevin] You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.",michael,41
2667,"Yes, your corner. Go.",michael,4
2669,Mmmhmmm.,michael,1
2671,"They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person. [to Phyllis] C'mere, c'mere, c'mon!  Come on! Come on.",michael,53
2673,Oooh!,michael,1
2675,I'm not worried.,michael,3
2677,"You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.",michael,17
2678,"Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.",michael,55
2679,He said what?,pam,3
2719,"I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms. Oh, breakfast.",michael,18
2721,"Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan.",michael,5
2723,"Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. 'Home Alone,' 'Risky Business.' Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do.",michael,36
2725,"Ok. [Removes biscuit, leaving only sausage, egg and cheese.] Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.",michael,14
2726,"Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate.",michael,12
2727,Diversifying. Smart.,dwight,2
2728,"Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you.",michael,38
2729,"And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers.",dwight,17
2730,Maybe.,michael,1
2731,[looks bored. Taps finger on desk. Head falls to desk],jim,10
2732,[laughs],pam,1
2733,"Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it's up to me to revive him.",pam,31
2734,You see Dwight's coffee mug?,pam,5
2735,Mm-hmm.,jim,1
2736,"Sometimes when he's not here, I try to throw stuff in it.",pam,12
2737,No way. Let's do this [crumples post it and throws into mug. Misses.] Oh.,jim,14
2738,Here.,pam,1
2739,Wind.,jim,1
2740,Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight.,pam,8
2741,Perfect. [misses],jim,2
2742,Oh.,pam,1
2743,Oh.,jim,1
2744,You should go.,dwight,3
2745,Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough.,michael,4
2746,Uh huh.,dwight,2
2747,Sign the papers at the condo.,michael,6
2748,You have your lawyer there?,dwight,5
2749,"Uh, I don't need one.",michael,5
2750,Can I be your representative?,dwight,5
2751,I don't need a representative.,michael,5
2752,I think I should be there.,dwight,6
2753,"No, No.",michael,2
2754,I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code.,dwight,11
2755,No. Dwight. I'm fine.,michael,4
2756,"Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work.",dwight,10
2757,"Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo, it's completely personal.",michael,14
2758,So you're taking a personal day?,dwight,6
2759,"Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.",michael,23
2760,"Please, I'll make you proud.",dwight,5
2761,"Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come.",michael,6
2762,Yes! As your representative?,dwight,4
2763,As my associate.,michael,3
2764,Same thing.,dwight,2
2765,No it is not.,michael,4
2767,"Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies.",michael,14
2768,You headed out?,pam,3
2769,We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don't you have everybody work on their expense reports and I'd like them in by the end of the day.,michael,33
2770,Ok.,pam,1
2771,Very good.,michael,2
2772,Have a great time.,pam,4
2773,"We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?",michael,16
2774,"Yeah, I changed them to your new address.",pam,8
2775,Good. The Small Business Man?,michael,5
2776,Yup.,pam,1
2777,Maxim? American Way? Cracked?,michael,4
2778,"Yes, I changed your Cracked magazine subscription.",pam,7
2779,"How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?",michael,7
2780,[shakes head],pam,2
2781,"NO, well can you get on that, because I don't just read Cracked.  Thank you.",michael,16
2782,Yeah.,pam,1
2783,Ok. See you soon.,michael,4
2784,What kind of shocks you got on this baby?,dwight,9
2785,"I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?",michael,15
2786,[tries to open sun roof] I want to put the top down.,dwight,12
2787,"What? No, Dwight. It's fifty degrees outside.  Don't... please...",michael,10
2788,But then no one can see us.,dwight,7
2789,I... Just... Would you put it up? [roof opens] Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.,michael,16
2790,Check it out. [points at sunglasses] Terminator.,dwight,7
2791,I do not understand what you spend your money on.,michael,10
2793,"Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?",jim,17
2795,[points at paper on desk] What does 2005 season mean?,jim,10
2797,"Wait a minute, what is this?",jim,6
2799,What?,jim,1
2801,Really?,jim,1
2804,"Oh my God!  Wait, this goes back two years.",jim,10
2806,[flicks football onto Kevin's desk] OH!,jim,6
2809,Yes!  So close.  I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game.  Yeah.,jim,18
2811,Why?,jim,1
2813,"Hey, do you guys have any other games?",jim,8
2817,"Home, sweet home.",michael,3
2818,Which one's yours?,dwight,3
2819,"Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait... [turns around] no, it's this one, right here. Home, sweet home.",michael,41
2820,[bounces ball off wall with Toby] So that's what this sound is all day.,jim,14
2822,"Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He'd always get rolled over by something.",michael,30
2824,Nice to meet you too.,michael,5
2825,This is smaller than your old place.,dwight,7
2826,"Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.",michael,27
2827,"Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex.",dwight,41
2829,"Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood.",dwight,11
2832,Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that.,michael,11
2833,Let's go check out the master bedroom.,dwight,7
2834,"Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?",jim,14
2836,Fair enough.,jim,2
2837,"This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness. [points at wall] Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall.",michael,57
2838,Oh. Terrible idea.,dwight,3
2839,I'm putting my bed right over here.,michael,7
2840,"No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed.",dwight,24
2841,"Well, then I will get a warrantee.",michael,7
2842,"Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off.",dwight,8
2843,Well then I won't get a warrantee.,michael,7
2844,Shh Shh.,dwight,2
2845,"So that's the problem, is solved. What?",michael,7
2846,Listen. [puts ear to wall] Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.,dwight,15
2847,[sings Olympic theme song] This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.,jim,26
2849,"Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids.",jim,20
2850,"Now the bronze are really blue, and they're also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system.",pam,21
2852,Let the games begin. [sings Olympic theme],jim,7
2854,What kind of mortgage did you get?,dwight,7
2855,Uh... Ten year.,michael,3
2857,What? Wha? You said ten.,michael,5
2859,"Ho, thirty years.",dwight,3
2860,"Ok, ok, ok.",michael,3
2861,"Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.",dwight,9
2862,Alright.,michael,1
2863,"Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live.",dwight,29
2864,Ok. Alright. Oh boy.,michael,4
2865,"Well, this is it.",dwight,4
2867,"Um. Oh. [moves stove burner] Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off?",michael,13
2869,"Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants.",dwight,5
2870,Um. I'm going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me.,michael,13
2871,We'll be here waiting for you.,dwight,6
2872,"Oh, man.",michael,2
2873,"A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people.",dwight,35
2875,"Uh. [breathes deeply, head at knees]",michael,6
2876,"You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?",jim,23

2878,Hum.,jim,1
2879,"In English, box of paper snowshoe racing.",pam,7
2880,"Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton.",jim,6
2881,"The thing about Jim, is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens.",pam,41
2882,"So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?",jim,9
2884,"Yes! Phyllis! [claps] Phyllis, just put your foot right through here [lifts strap on box of paper]. Right through the flonk.",jim,21
2885,"The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I don't... I don't...",michael,14
2887,...know if you showed me this same unit or not.,michael,10
2889,Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.,michael,17
2891,"As far as I can tell, I'm the best-looking person here.",michael,11
2892,"There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It's just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you've no place to go but down.",michael,35
2894,"No, no, no.",michael,3
2896,I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.,michael,18
2898,Ehhhh....,michael,1
2899,I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun.,michael,28
2900,Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? [laughs],dwight,15

2913,You didn't have to...,dwight,4
2914,"No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.",michael,34
2915,"Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.",michael,32
2916,I don't even know what to say.,dwight,7
2917,"I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone.",michael,29

2927,"Well, let's play, what is it?",pam,6

2935,We take separate cars.,michael,4
2936,Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?,dwight,11
2937,Why would we do that?,michael,5
2938,Just for fun?,dwight,3
2939,No.,michael,1
2940,Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?,dwight,9

2942,"Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch.",dwight,47
2945,Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration?,jim,6
2947,Ryan Howard. Ryan! [claps] Gold medal.,jim,6

2951,"Alright Pam, alright [gives her hi-five]. Nice work!",jim,8
2952,[sees Angela making check mark on tally sheet],pam,8
2954,You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm.  We paid it off early.,dwight,23
2955,"Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.",michael,16
2956,People love beets.,dwight,3
2957,Nobody likes beets.,michael,3
2958,Everybody loves beets.,dwight,3
2959,"Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet.",michael,28

2994,"Get up here, Dwight.",michael,4
2995,Silver medal.,dwight,2

3127,Okay.,jim,1
3128,"Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he's kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think.",michael,51
3130,"Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent! [laughs]",michael,13
3131,Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years.,dwight,14
3132,"Five years from now, what do you want to do? Where do you want to be?",michael,16
3134,Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager?,michael,9
3136,That is ridiculous.,michael,3
3137,Ryan's about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one.,michael,19
3138,[speaks in a Yoda voice] Much advice you seek. [regular voice] Do you know who that is?,michael,17
3140,Mmm... No. That was Yoda.,michael,5

3279,Stupid!,dwight,1

3324,Dwight.,pam,1
3325,What?,jim,1
3326,"I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway.",dwight,21
3327,"You know what you should do? You should quit. And then, that would stick it to both of them.",jim,19
3328,"Oh Jim, I'm not going to quit. Then Ryan wins.",dwight,10

3389,"[coughing] Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.",dwight,41
3390,"Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school.",michael,17
3391,That's exactly what I said.,dwight,5

3512,"Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning.",michael,5

3541,Why did you put it off until Halloween?,pam,8
3542,Because it's very scary stuff.,michael,5
3543,I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little.,pam,12
3544,You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here.,michael,12
3545,So it's a man?,pam,4
3546,"No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?",michael,34
3547,I just answer the phone.,pam,5
3548,And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.,michael,9
3549,You're costume is fantastic! [laughs],pam,5

3568,"[looks to Oscar] Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.",michael,21
3570,All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?,michael,18
3572,"Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good?",michael,14
3574,"Good.  Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm  going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.",michael,40
3576,"Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.",michael,18
3577,"Mmm-hm-hmm. Interesting take on Dorothy. I love it. Hey, you know what would even be better? Soccer ball and cleats.",michael,20

3589,But that doesn't sound good.,pam,5
3590,"Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player? [Pam laughs and types]",jim,13
3591,"Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India.",jim,46
3592,He's a gun nut.,pam,4
3593,Um. He sticks to his guns.,jim,6
3601,Who do you think it should be?,michael,7

3605,Eh.,michael,1
3606,Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.,dwight,6
3607,It's not a popularity contest. Although it does make sense to fire the least popular because it has the least effect on morale.,michael,23
3608,One of the warehouse guys.,dwight,5
3609,"[turns to the fake head, listening] What? There was someone left off that list? Who?",michael,15
3610,Who is he saying?,dwight,4

3612,"No, Michael.",dwight,2
3613,"Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.",michael,7
3614,"No, not me.",dwight,3
3615,Yeah... I could.,michael,3
3616,Not Dwight.,dwight,2
3617,I'm not saying that's what he said.,michael,7
3618,I know that's what he said.,dwight,6
3619,[listening to his head] What?,michael,5
3620,"Tell him, not Dwight.",dwight,4
3621,That is not a very nice thing to say about him.,michael,11
3622,Tell him to stop.,dwight,4
3623,Are you kidding?,michael,3
3624,"Quiet, you.",dwight,2
3625,I agree. He'd land on his feet.,michael,7
3626,Make him be quiet.,dwight,4
3628,"No, I made brownies.",pam,4
3630,... What?,pam,2
3632,I made brownies.,pam,3
3634,I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.,pam,16
3635,"[on phone] Dunder-Mifflin. This is Pam. [listens] Uh, yeah. [snaps her fingers in the air, getting Jim's attention] Just one second. I will, uh, transfer you to our manager, Michael Scott.",pam,31

3639,As Assistant Regional Manager...,dwight,4

3643,So. How did it go with Stanley? How... how'd he take it?,michael,12
3644,He wouldn't listen to me,dwight,5
3645,"Ahh, come on.",michael,3
3646,"If you want to fire him, you're going to have to tell him yourself.",dwight,14
3647,"I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just... [waves Dwight away]",michael,32
3649,"Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most.",dwight,47
3654,"Jim is really talented. And he should be the one who's getting a better job offer. Like, for real.",pam,19
3655,"Don't take this the wrong way, but... you should go for that job.",pam,13
3656,Um... it's in Maryland.,jim,4
3657,"Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge.",pam,17
3658,Yeah.  Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will. [starts walking away],jim,13
3659,Jim...,pam,1

3663,Fantastic!,michael,1
3664,And I turned it down.,dwight,5
3665,What?! That would've solved all my problems.,michael,7
3666,Out of loyalty to this company...,dwight,6
3667,"Oh, you idiot.",michael,3
3668,... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.,dwight,12
3669,"If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody.",michael,9
3670,But then you wouldn't have me here.,dwight,7
3671,"Big deal. Oh, it would've worked out so well. Can you get it back?",michael,14
3672,It's in Maryland.,dwight,3
3673,You can call. Can you call 'em?,michael,7

3740,"I have to fire someone today, okay?",michael,7

3803,"I don't know. Hey, are you on our payroll or are you employed by the building?",michael,16
3805,"Oh, shoot. Okay, well, just have your pepper spray ready.",michael,10

3866,I didn't lose my desk.,dwight,5
3867,"Okay, calm down.  Where was the last place you saw it?",jim,12

3893,Ok.,jim,1
3894,"I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei.",dwight,51

3936,Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me.,dwight,8
3937,No I'm not.,jim,3
3938,"Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you.",dwight,21
3939,"Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this: umm, don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it. [reveals Dwight's purple belt]",jim,28
3940,"Ok, give that back to me.",dwight,6
3941,"Ok, say please.",jim,3

3944,Please?,dwight,1
3945,"Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.",jim,8
3946,Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.,dwight,26

3957,So? I've beaten up black belts.,michael,6
3958,"Uh, how did you know they were black belts?",jim,9
3959,"They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out.",michael,28
3964,"And after that, nobody ever messed with the 'Damn Rascals' ever again.",michael,12
3965,"Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, [starts snapping] you're a Jet all the way, right?",jim,15
3966,You were a Jet?,michael,4
3968,"Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me. [Puts Dwight in a headlock] Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link.",michael,48

3977,What belt are they?,dwight,4
3978,"Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'...",michael,9

3989,Yeah. [Jim opens office door for Michael] Thank you.,michael,9
3990,I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.,dwight,51
3991,"Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.",jim,13

4000,I just have a quick question.,pam,6
4001,"I haven't signed them, ok?",michael,5
4002,"No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?",pam,34
4003,"Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough.",michael,24

4019,"No, Really?",michael,2
4020,"In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai.",dwight,12
4021,"Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22.",michael,25
4022,"Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!",dwight,13
4023,"Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches: me punching you and you hitting the floor.",michael,22
4024,"No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.",dwight,10
4025,Really?,michael,1
4026,Yeah.,dwight,1

4037,"Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight...

4038,I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll.,michael,9

4172,Alyssa? I guess she's technically the senpai. But nobody really respects her. The only reason she got into regionals was because her competition was a bunch of 13-year-old girls. Put me in that division. Let's see how she does.,dwight,39

4533,"Oh, yes, we do.",dwight,4
4534,"No, we don't.",jim,3
4535,"Yeah, it's a new product.  So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise.",dwight,23
4536,"Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.",jim,17
4537,"Uh, that is so stupid.  What if he gives it to you?",dwight,13
4538,I win.,jim,2
4539,"Ugh, you know what?  I am going to zone you out for the rest of today.  I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday.  Uh, stupid.",dwight,49
4540,"Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?",jim,12
4541,"Uh, duh.",dwight,2
4542,Duh.,jim,1
4543,Today is Thursday.  But Dwight thinks that it's Friday.  And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.,jim,20

4562,Interesting.  Jan is calling me.  Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all. [puts Jan on speakerphone] Yeah?,michael,19
4564,Jan!  To what do I owe this pleasure?,michael,9
4566,"Well, hello to you, too.  Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's.",michael,37

4586,"Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do.  I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas.  Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down?  In a folder?  A 'Michael-idea' folder?",michael,44
4587,Sorry.,pam,1
4588,That's unfortunate.  How 'bout the suggestion box?  There's tons of ideas in there.,michael,15
4589,What suggestion box?,pam,3
4590,"The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously?  Maybe there's prizes?",michael,19
4591,"Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started.",pam,15
4592,"Why don't you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I'll tell them.  Hello, everybody?  Yeah, uh, attention, please.  Jan Levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we're going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p.",michael,51
4594,What did I say?,michael,4

4635,"Oh my God, did you see 'The Apprentice' last night?",pam,10

4643,"Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting.",pam,8
4644,I'm kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn't interrupt.,michael,13
4645,You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.,pam,15
4646,"I did not, not, not use those words.",michael,8
4648,"No, it's in like ten minutes.",michael,6
4649,Everyone's waiting in the conference room.,pam,6
4652,What should we do to prepare for Y2K?,dwight,8
4654,"Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box. [to Jan] That happens occasionally.",michael,14
4655,It happens occasionally.,dwight,3
4656,"And, um, one down.  Next suggestion: 'we need better outreach for employees fighting depression'.  Ok, alright, enough with the jokes.  Nobody in here is suffering from depression.",michael,30
4658,"Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?",michael,7
4659,Tom?,dwight,1
4660,Tom.  Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.,michael,15

4664,"Arrr, dooby dooby do. 'You need to do something about your B.O.'",michael,12
4665,You need to do something about your B.O.,dwight,8
4666,"Ok, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion.  Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.",michael,38
4668,"Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words.",michael,24
4671,You need-,dwight,2
4672,Ok.,michael,1
4673,To do something about-,dwight,4
4674,"Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.",michael,21
4676,"Yeah, is that hard for you?  Alright, well-",michael,9
4678,I'll work on that-,michael,4
4681,"Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?",dwight,9
4682,"Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion.",michael,6
4683,Next suggestion.,dwight,2
4684,"Don't sl-', ok, that's blank [Dwight picks up note] Don't, just put it-",michael,13
4685,Don't sleep with your boss'? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?,dwight,15
4687,I don't understand why you're so upset.,michael,7
4689,Let me ask you-,michael,4
4691,"Ok, let me ask you this.",michael,6
4693,Let me ask you something.,michael,5
4695,Where did you get your outfit?,michael,6
4697,I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.,michael,12
4699,Look-,michael,1
4700,Michael?,dwight,1
4701,Oh my God...,michael,3
4702,"I'm sorry, am I interrupting?  Oh God; were you guys making out?",dwight,13
4704,Great.,dwight,1
4705,What do you want Dwight?,michael,5
4706,I am ready for my performance review.,dwight,7
4707,"Ok, great.  Your performance has been adequate.  You may leave; goodbye.",michael,13
4709,"You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave.",michael,8
4710,"Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?",dwight,9
4711,Why on earth would we give you a raise?,michael,9
4712,"That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking.  Let me bring up one word: dedication. [points to graphs] I have never been late.  Also, I have never missed a day due to illness. [Michael sighs] Even when I had walking pneumonia.  I even come in on holidays.",dwight,51
4713,You do?  How do you get in?,michael,8
4714,I have a copy of your key.,dwight,7
4716,That is a serious offense. Very serious.  As is toying with a man's heart.,michael,15
4718,I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.,dwight,12
4719,"Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that?",michael,8
4720,"For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.",dwight,13
4721,"That was deer!? Gross, oh!",michael,5
4722,You liked it!,dwight,3
4723,"Oh, did not!",michael,3
4724,"Jan, have you ever had deer?",dwight,6
4726,"It's a delicacy.  And you know what?  It's an aphrodisiac.  So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.",dwight,35
4727,"What do you say, Jan?",michael,5
4729,"Ok. You just, uh, clear your head.",michael,7
4732,"And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said 'Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of'.",dwight,23
4733,That's from Superman?,michael,3
4734,"Smallville.  And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.",dwight,13
4735,Do you think Michael and Jan actually...,pam,7
4736,"I don't really wanna picture it.  But thank you, Pam.",jim,11
4737,How do you come back from that?,pam,7
4738,"Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together.",jim,17
4739,"No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?",pam,14
4740,Oh-,jim,1
4741,As a human being.,pam,4
4742,"Yeah, no, I don't think you can.",jim,7
4744,Wait.,michael,1
4746,"Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?",michael,11
4748,"Ok, so you're saying that there is a different time or place?",michael,12
4750,"Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance?",michael,17
4752,"I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio?",michael,13
4754,Am I too short?,michael,4
4756,Really?,michael,1
4758,"I appreciate that, thank you.",michael,5
4760,"No, I wasn't, I didn't cry-",michael,6
4762,So my looks have nothing to do with it?,michael,9
4764,Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now.  And it doesn't matter how great a guy I am.  And that is all I needed; I'm good.  I can go home now.,michael,42
4765,"Hey, it's 12:20; where the hell's Dwight?",michael,7
4766,Ummm... no idea.,jim,3
4767,"Never missed a day, my ass.",michael,6
4768,[Jim bows to Pam; she bows back] Thank you.,pam,9
4769,[running through parking lot] I'm here! I'm here! I'm here! It's ok!,dwight,12
4772,So...,michael,1
4774,"Um, you're in accounting...",michael,4
4776,"So, good, good, good. Something to work toward, being here more. I'm a big believer in people being here more.",michael,20
4796,"I am not going to discuss anything outside of Dunder Mifflin business, period.' Okay. Now, why would Jan say she only wants to talk business and then make it clear that she is on her period? God, I don't understand women. How about a clear signal, right? Is that too much to ask?",michael,53
4899,Are we in danger?,jim,4
4900,"There's no time to think about if this is real.  Just, shh, everybody. [knock at the front door]",michael,19
4902,The IT tech guy and me did not get off to a great start.,michael,14
4903,"Yeah, I tried to install it myself, but, uh, you guys have these things so password-protected...",michael,16
4905,Oh...,michael,1
4907,"Oh, umm... [looks at Post-It on computer]",michael,7
4909,Yes.,michael,1
4910,Mi-,dwight,1
4911,AH! Guh-oood.,michael,2
4912,Sorry.,dwight,1
4913,Please don't do that.,michael,4
4914,"Ok, I'm sorry.  What is going on in there? Why is he here?  What are you doing?",dwight,19
4915,I can't tell you.,michael,4
4916,You have to tell me.,dwight,5
4917,I don't have to tell you anything.,michael,7
4918,"Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.",dwight,34
4919,"Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok?  I'm in the best shape of my life.  Look at this. [flexes his arms] Brrr!  That's strong!",michael,29
4920,"Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-",dwight,11
4921,I'm not going get a brain-,michael,6
4922,Or get hit by a car-,dwight,6
4923,Stop it.,michael,2
4924,"Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke.",dwight,17
4925,"Uh, oh, ok; if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok?  Why don't you just go... away?",michael,27
4926,"There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees.  His salary, that would depress them.  His bed, it---  And I am not going to tell them that I'll be reading their e-mails.",michael,38
4927,So how do you search?,michael,5
4931,"Oh, no, everybody; Oscar's gone crazy!  What other ghost stories do you have for us?  That I'm a robot? [robot voice]  I will destroy everything in my path-",michael,31
4933,Beep! Bop!,michael,2
4935,Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk.  [Tin Man voice] Oil can. Oil can.,michael,12
4937,"Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose.",michael,8
4938,So it's true?  You have access to our e-mails?,dwight,10
4939,You know what the problem is?,michael,6
4941,"The problem is that when people hear the term 'big brother', they immediately think it's scary or bad, but I don't. I think, wow, I love my big brother.",michael,29
4943,"Oh hey, just so ya know, if you have a lot of sensitive e-mails, they need to be deleted immediately.",dwight,20
4945,Good. [Pam overhears],dwight,3
4946,[whispers to Jim] Hey.  Something just happened.  Dwight just told Angela that she has to deleted all of her sensitive e-mails immediately.,pam,24
4947,What?,jim,1
4948,I know!,pam,2
4949,Hmm...,jim,1
4950,Do you think that they're like-,pam,6
4951,No.,jim,1
4952,"No, right, no, no.",pam,4
4953,[humming],jim,1
4954,"Uhhh, ew, ew, ew... .Maybe?",pam,5
4955,It's like squishing a spider under a book.  It's gonna be really gross but I have to look and make sure that it's really dead.  Sooo... [to camera guys] If you guys see anything... ?,pam,37
4956,"Hey, Dwight, um, my friend is kinda into these two girls that he works with.",pam,15
4957,Nice.,dwight,1
4958,"One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental.  Who do you think he should choose?",pam,26
4959,Does he have access to their medical records?,dwight,8
4960,Ummmm...,pam,1
4961,"I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records.  As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories.  Yeast infections.  There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county.  Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory.",dwight,58
4962,"Meredith has an E-vite from Jim.  Barbeque at Jim's tonight.  Tonight?  Wonder where my e-vitation is.  Click on guest list.  Angela, Stanley, Oscar, Meredith, Phyllis, Kevin, Creed.  Must be... .[scrolls down list] No.",michael,39
4963,"Hey, Angela-",pam,2
4965,How's it going?,pam,3
4967,"Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight?",pam,9
4969,"No. I mean, I don't know, I don't think so.",pam,10
4971,Oh.,pam,1
4972,"There's always a distance between a boss and the employees.  It is just nature's rule.  It's intimidation mostly, it's the awareness that they are not me.  I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys.  But maybe I need to be even approachabler.",michael,51
4974,Yeah.,pam,1
4976,"Of course.  Hangin' with my crew, crew that I am one of.  Hangin' with my Cup of Noodles.  This is a meal in a cup.",michael,28
4977,Uh hum.,jim,2
4978,"Hot, tasty.  Reminds me of college.  Lived on this stuff.  Brain food.  Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college?  The parties.  Everybody'd go.  The athletes, the, the nerds, professors.",michael,39
4979,The professors would go to the parties?,pam,7
4980,Yeah!  They were the most fun.  We always invited them.,michael,12
4982,[to cameraman] What? [looks at Dwight eating a Baby Ruth] Ohhhh... Yes!  Thank you!,pam,15
4983,Question: on the Internet there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight-,dwight,18
4984,"Oh, uh, no. Could-",jim,4
4985,I was wondering-,dwight,3
4986,"Could, keep that down.",jim,4
4987,Why?,dwight,1
4988,Because not everybody knows about the party.,jim,7
4989,Like who?  Who doesn't know?,dwight,6
4990,"Umm, Michael.",jim,2
4991,Why just Michael?,dwight,3
4992,Because it's a surprise.,jim,4
4993,Is it?,dwight,2
4994,Uh hmm.,jim,2
4995,"Oh, that's perfect!",dwight,3
4996,"So, don't tell.",jim,3
4997,I won't.,dwight,2
4998,Ok.,jim,1
4999,"So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.",jim,11
5000,Really? That's great.,pam,3
5001,I know.,jim,2
5002,Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.,pam,10
5003,"[laughs] Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or...",jim,37
5004,"Oh, no, he can't make it.",pam,6
5005,"Oh, ok, cool.",jim,3
5006,Hey there.,michael,2
5007,Hey.,jim,1
5008,Almost quittin' time.,michael,3
5009,"Yup, it's, uh, four o'clock.",jim,5

5011,"Oh, um... .I can't.",jim,4
5012,You have plans.,michael,3
5013,"Uh hmm, definitely.",jim,3
5014,"I do, too. I do, too.",michael,6
5015,You do?,jim,2
5016,"I do, yeah. Big plans.",michael,5
5017,Because you said 'do you wanna hang out'-,jim,8

5020,Yeah.,michael,1
5021,"Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun.",jim,8
5022,"It's the best.  It's the best.  I would not miss it for the world.  But if something else came up, I would definitely not go.",michael,28
5023,Improv sounds great.,jim,3
5024,It is. Ok.,michael,3
5025,Alright.,jim,1
5026,[someone coughs] What?,michael,3
5027,I think Stanley just coughed.,jim,5

5042,You are a liar.,michael,4
5044,"Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre.  You and I are hangin' tonight.  The two of us.  We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood.  You know what?  Why don't we watch that show that you've been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy.",michael,50

5056,"Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention.  We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.",jim,42
5057,"Jim!  You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock?",dwight,14
5059,You don't work with us.,dwight,5
5060,That's because Mark's my roommate.,jim,5
5062,"Thanks.  Yeah, I always keep an extra set in the car, for special occasions.  Jim, come here.",dwight,19
5063,Uh hmm.,jim,2

5160,"Just because two people are hanging out, it doesn't mean that they're together,  you know?  Like people can just be friends.  And I think that it was really unfair to think that there was anything else going on.",pam,41

5336,"It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G's. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that.",michael,55
5338,You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party.,pam,11
5339,"Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody.",michael,14

5355,That makes sense because he has elfish features.,michael,8
5356,"[now wearing an elf hat and ears] Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael.",dwight,58

5379,"Hey, I could get some flares from my car.",dwight,9
5380,"No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let's do Secret Santa.",michael,11
5381,"Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, 'Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth.'",michael,33
5382,"First present, Oscar.",dwight,3
5386,Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim.,dwight,10
5387,"Oh, cool. [opens his plastic bag]",jim,6
5389,Great. Where did you get it?,jim,6
5391,"He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag.",jim,31
5393,Pam.,dwight,1
5394,"[opens up her present] Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome.",pam,17
5395,There's a little more to it.,jim,6
5396,"All right, next. Ryan. [tosses present]",dwight,6
5397,"No, don't!",michael,2
5399,"Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.",michael,22
5401,You don't know that.,michael,4
5403,I did?,michael,2
5405,"What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?",michael,22
5406,Michael.,dwight,1
5407,"Oh hey, for me. What is in here? [opens a handmade oven mitt] Oh, come on.",michael,16
5409,An oven mitt? Okay. [walks out],michael,6
5410,"So Phyllis is basically saying, 'Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth.' I gave Ryan an iPod.",michael,35
5412,We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.,dwight,10
5413,I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.,michael,13
5414,What is Yankee Swap?,jim,4
5415,"One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift.",michael,35
5416,I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.,jim,7
5417,"Yeah, we call it White Elephant.",pam,6
5418,"Well, I call it fun!",michael,5
5420,Because it's better. Because it's more special.,michael,7
5422,"Shut it. No, it's not. Okay, just give it a shot.",michael,11
5424,"Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt.",michael,30
5426,"Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.",jim,10
5427,"Yankee Swap! That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.",michael,15
5428,I'll take the iPod.,pam,4
5430,"Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.",dwight,20
5433,I think this is going great.,michael,6
5437,"Angela, you're up.",dwight,3
5440,Everyone wants the iPod. It's a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.,michael,14
5441,"Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn.",michael,11
5444,"Okay, moving along. Meredith, let's go.",dwight,6
5446,It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else.,dwight,9
5447,"[holding oven mitt] I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It's beautiful.",michael,30
5449,"Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology.",michael,11
5450,"Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.",michael,39
5451,"[opens present] 'In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute.'",michael,17
5452,"You and me, Michael. Yes!",dwight,5
5453,Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?,michael,13
5454,I never said it was better than an iPod.,dwight,9
5455,"Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.",dwight,26
5456,"[shooting paintball gun at target] Take that, Saddam!",dwight,8
5457,Last gift. Kevin.,michael,3
5460,"Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.",dwight,8
5461,I want the iPod.,pam,4
5463,Sure you don't want the teapot?,jim,6
5464,"Well, I mean, it's an iPod. But ..",pam,8
5465,Right.,jim,1
5466,"Sorry, I ..",pam,3
5467,No. No. Definitely. It's ..,jim,5
5469,Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.,dwight,9
5470,Got to be kidding me.,jim,5
5471,Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.,dwight,8
5472,[after Phyllis leaves suddenly] What is she so upset about?,michael,10
5473,Maybe because you hated her present so much.,pam,8
5474,Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets.,michael,28
5475,"Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.",jim,14
5477,"Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!",michael,23
5479,How much?,pam,2
5480,"It wasn't. It wasn't that much. It was $3,000.",michael,9
5482,"Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party's so lame.",michael,27
5484,"All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?",michael,14
5486,"Cool, cool. Box it up.",michael,5
5487,"I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?",jim,20
5488,No trades.,dwight,2
5489,"Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.",jim,8
5490,A real man makes his own luck.' Billy Zane.,dwight,9
5491,"Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?",jim,12
5492,No. I want it. I'm going to use it.,dwight,9
5493,You don't even drink tea.,jim,5
5494,"True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems ..",dwight,22
5495,Okay ..,jim,2
5496,".. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. [demonstrates]",dwight,11
5497,"To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle.",jim,19
5499,I know. It's totally going to change the way I work out.,pam,12
5501,So what are you going to get me instead?,pam,9
5503,Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty.,michael,8
5505,"This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.",michael,8
5508,"Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?",michael,32
5510,"Go, here we go!",michael,4
5532,"Anybody making out in here? [checks hallway] Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink. [takes picture of Jim] Okay, how's it going in here? [takes picture of Meredith and Kevin]",michael,32
5535,"No, no, no, no. We'll find some, don't leave the party.",michael,11
5537,"Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee.",michael,8
5539,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",michael,3
5541,"Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend.",michael,8
5542,"You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.",jim,16
5543,"[laughs] No, I was just checking out my present. [holds up teapot]",pam,12
5544,But ..,jim,2
5545,"I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so ..",pam,38
5546,"Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.",jim,16
5547,[opens teapot] Oh my god! The yearbook picture!,pam,8
5548,"Yeah, I think I made the right choice.",pam,8
5549,"Oh, my God! It's incredible. [Jim reaches and steals his card back before she can notice it] Is this the Boggle timer?",pam,22
5550,I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't.,jim,13
5551,This is so awesome.,dwight,4
5552,"Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to.",michael,19
5553,Thank you.,dwight,2
5554,You're welcome.,michael,2
5556,"No way. Oh, you're kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen!",michael,13
5558,"Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake.",michael,11
5560,"Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up.",michael,17
5562,Darryl. There you go. [hands him the Santa hat] You earned it.,michael,12
5564,"No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it.",michael,12
5566,"Hey, Merry Christmas.",michael,3
5570,[coming out of his office] Lampshade on head! It's happening!,michael,10
5573,"Oh, hello there. [Kelly leans up and kisses him] But what are you doing?",dwight,14
5575,You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.,dwight,13
5580,Yes.,dwight,1
5582,"Yeah, that sounds good.",michael,4
5583,"Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What's better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It's really the greatest day of all time.",michael,55
5584,"Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard's?",michael,7
5586,"Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride? [Meredith drops her top. Michael takes a picture] All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?",michael,28
5588,Okay!,michael,1
5597,Phyllis and Angela and Meredith are helpers. I guess Angela's kind of... Angela's little. Phyllis and Meredith are not little. Pam is sort of a medium helper.,michael,27
5599,"Dwight is... Dwight looks like Spock to me. He always wears the ears, and I always give him grief about looking like Spock, and he hates it because he has a different pair of ears that he wears to be Spock, for some reason.",michael,44
5611,"What separates humans from jungle beasts? The fact that we have rules. When humans give each other gifts, they do it properly and orderly. When bears give each other gifts they just rip open a fox carcass and present it to their mate. I prefer the human way.",dwight,48
5649,Hey.,jim,1
5650,Hello. Jim?,dwight,2
5651,"What's up, buddy?",jim,3
5652,This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?,dwight,10
5653,"Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.",jim,11
5654,"Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy.",dwight,23
5655,"Who, Steve?",jim,2
5656,"Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is.",dwight,6
5657,"Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup.",pam,14
5658,"No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup.",dwight,9
5659,"Um, I don't think so, I just bought it.",pam,9
5660,"Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me.",dwight,13
5661,I love these.,pam,3
5662,"Okay, fine. Where's my wallet?",dwight,5
5663,"Oh, there it is. J1.",jim,5
5664,But I don't have any...,dwight,5
5665,"Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.",jim,9
5666,"[putting quarters in] Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five...",dwight,8
5667,"Hello, everyone.",michael,2
5668,"Good morning, Michael.",dwight,3
5670,Ah! Ha ha ha!,michael,4
5671,"Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo.",pam,8
5672,"It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask.'",jim,20
5673,A ski mask and a swimsuit.,pam,6
5674,"So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.",jim,15
5675,And brush our teeth.,pam,4
5676,Yeah?,michael,1
5678,Stanley! Bo banley.,michael,3
5680,Banana fana fo fanley.,michael,4
5682,Be my mo manley.,michael,4
5684,Stanley.,michael,1
5686,"Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it?",michael,9
5688,"Maybe, I don't know.",michael,4
5690,"Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.",michael,22
5692,It's cheaper.,michael,2
5693,This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.,michael,29
5694,It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It's a booze cruise!,michael,26
5697,"No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.",michael,22
5699,"Well, this...",michael,2
5701,Yeah?,michael,1
5703,To throw you off the scent.,michael,6
5705,"Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.",michael,11
5707,"Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, 'Who is this smart little cookie?' Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.",michael,53
5708,"I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.",michael,50
5709,"Leader... ship. The word 'ship' is hidden inside the word 'leadership,' as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork!",michael,38
5711,"Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?",michael,14
5713,"Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.",michael,20
5715,"Yeesh, how old is this ship?",jim,6
5716,How about the anchor?,pam,4
5718,"All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!",michael,57
5719,I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?,jim,17
5720,Titanic?,michael,1
5721,I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October.,pam,10
5722,"No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on!",michael,6
5723,"Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.",jim,27
5725,"No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse.",michael,41
5727,"The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.",michael,26
5728,"Aye aye, Captain.",dwight,3
5729,"[singing] A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.",michael,7
5730,"Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey. [to Kelly] Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring... [to Stanley] We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan.",michael,47
5731,Cool.,dwight,1
5733,"I'd rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party.",michael,15
5735,Okay.,michael,1
5736,"In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulose.",michael,20
5737,"Hey, look! I'm king of the world!",michael,7
5739,"And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!",michael,12
5741,Okay! So...,michael,2
5743,Right.,michael,1
5745,"But don't worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight.",michael,13
5747,I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna...,michael,20
5749,Rock it!,michael,2
5751,"If the boat's a-rockin', don't come knockin'!",michael,7
5753,Yep.,michael,1
5755,We're all gonna have a good time tonight!,michael,8
5757,Hm? Okay. Yep.,michael,3
5763,"It's not hilarious, but...",jim,4
5767,"Um, no.",jim,2
5770,Having fun?,michael,2
5772,"Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.",michael,14
5774,"Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so... right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support.",michael,53
5776,"So, okay.",michael,2
5777,"Limbo, whoo!",dwight,2
5781,"Me! Me, me, me.",dwight,4
5783,I'm stronger.,dwight,2
5786,"I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.",dwight,52
5788,"But before that, I have to do my presentation.",michael,9
5790,"All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!",michael,31
5791,Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.,michael,30
5792,[singing] What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?,dwight,29
5794,"I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!",dwight,10
5797,"No, I'm not going to do that.",pam,7
5800,"Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out?",pam,12
5802,It's getting kind of rowdy down there.,pam,7
5803,Yeah. [chanting] Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!,jim,5
5804,Sometimes I just don't get Roy.,pam,6
5805,Well...,jim,1
5806,"I mean, I don't know. So... what's it like dating a cheerleader?",pam,12
5807,"Oh, um... [A long silence.]",jim,5
5808,I'm cold.,pam,2
5810,"Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?",michael,34
5812,"No, no. Salesmen and profit centers.",michael,6
5814,"Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership.",michael,9
5816,Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.,dwight,7
5817,Okay.,michael,1
5818,"Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour.",dwight,20
5820,"Uh, I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So... you don't wanna ask my advice.",pam,20
5822,"Um... let's see, uh...  The customer. Because the customer is king.",jim,12
5823,"Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.",michael,10
5827,You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.,jim,15
5829,"I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?",michael,28
5831,"Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing.  Congratulations. That is great!",michael,22
5833,Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!,michael,10
5834,"No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there.",pam,11
5835,Then I'll give you away!,michael,5
5836,"No, thank you.",pam,3
5838,No.,jim,1
5840,I don't know. Let's break up.,jim,6
5844,Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.,dwight,10
5845,Captain Jack is a fart face. I'm on medication.,michael,9
5849,"It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about.",michael,17
5850,"I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.",michael,45
5851,Is somebody there?,michael,3
5852,What happened to you?,jim,4
5853,Captain Jack has a problem with authority.,michael,7
5854,"Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?",jim,10
5855,"He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.",michael,13
5856,What a night.,jim,3
5857,"Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged.",michael,9
5858,She was always engaged.,jim,4
5859,Roy said the first one didn't count.,michael,7
5860,"That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so...",jim,18
5861,"Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan...",michael,39
5862,"Yeah, I know.",jim,3
5863,"Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute.",michael,6
5864,"Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.",jim,12
5865,"Well, if you like her so much, don't give up.",michael,10
5866,She's engaged.,jim,2
5867,BFD. Engaged ain't married.,michael,4
5868,Huh.,jim,1
5869,"Never, ever, ever give up.",michael,5
5870,"Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore.",dwight,8
5871,"It's a fake wheel, dummy.",michael,5
5935,"Hey, Captain Jack, what kind of fish they got in this lake?",dwight,12
5937,"You know, my grandfather told me there was a monster here that eats Catholics. Have you heard...",dwight,17
5939,"If the hull is breached for any reason or the boat is overtaken, I am a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy, and you can count on me.",dwight,25
5941,"Your problem now, Captain Jack.",michael,5
5961,Those slide moves are just bush league. I hope I die before I'm old.,michael,14
5973,"No, I really don't want to.",jim,6
5976,Yeah! Toast!,michael,2
5978,Yeah.,pam,1
5980,"Thanks, Katy. Um, didn't really prepare anything to say. We're all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she's awesome. And...",jim,36
5981,"Okay, okay. My turn, my turn. Is this thing on? Uh, I want to congratulate the happy couple. You know, they say that marriage is an institution. And I say, who wants to be in an institution?",dwight,37
5982,"That's my line! That's my line, That's... I always say that at weddings. So I'll just think of something else to say. I... [band starts playing]",michael,26
5992,"[off camera] Yeah, that's right.",jim,5
5993,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.",pam,5
5994,Pam! It's Michael.  Help me!  I need help right now.,michael,12
5995,"Michael, what's wrong?",pam,3

5997,"Ok, wait wait wait wait...",pam,5
5998,"Ungh, this is not looking good Pam!",michael,7
5999,"Michael, do you need me to call an ambulance?!",pam,9
6000,"No, I want you to pick me up.",michael,8
6001,What?,jim,1
6002,Ok...,pam,1
6003,What's going on?,jim,3
6004,"Wait a second, I thought you said that you were hurt.",pam,11
6005,I am hurt. I hurt my foot.,michael,7
6006,I'm sorry? Pam.,jim,3
6007,[exasperated],pam,1
6008,What is going on?,jim,4
6009,I want to come to work.  But I need you to come and pick me up. [Jim lunges across Pam's desk and puts Michael on speakerphone],michael,27
6010,OH GOD!,michael,2
6011,"Hey, whoa, Michael...",jim,3
6012,Oh God!,michael,2
6013,"It's, okay, it's Jim.  Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.",jim,13
6014,"OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.",michael,24
6015,You burned,jim,2
6017,"Pam, could you come get me?!",michael,6
6018,"Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone.",pam,10
6019,"Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?",michael,9
6021,There's no toilet paper here.  Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper.  Could you tell 'em that?,michael,20
6023,"I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.",michael,19
6024,[panicked] No one wants to pick me up!?,michael,8
6025,"[silence, Dwight enters the office] What is going on? What is going on?",dwight,13
6026,"Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him.",pam,13
6027,I'm not sick! I'm burned!,michael,5
6028,I'm coming Michael!,dwight,3
6029,Oh...,jim,1
6030,I'm gonna save you!,dwight,4
6031,Don't... is that Dwight?  I do not want Dwight.,michael,10
6032,Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!,dwight,8
6033,I don't want Dwight!,michael,4
6034,"Michael, why don't you call your girlfriend?",pam,7
6035,I don't have a girlfriend.,michael,5
6036,But you said that you went out with her this weekend.,jim,11
6037,"It was all made up.  Just someone come, ok?  Anyone.  Anyone but Dwight.",michael,16
6038,[sounds of a car crash] What was that...,jim,8
6039,What was that?! [everyone runs to Michael's office window],pam,9
6040,Oh!,jim,1
6041,Ohhhhhh!,pam,1
6042,He hit the pole!,jim,4
6043,"It's broken right, he can't...",jim,5
6044,Oh my gosh.,pam,3
6045,"Oh Dwight, Dwight, [Dwight pukes on his back windshield]  Ohhhhhh!",jim,11
6047,Is he ok?,pam,3
6048,"He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!",jim,8
6049,Hellooo? ... Please don't send Dwight!,michael,6
6050,"Morning everyone.  Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out.  Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing.  I just want to be treated normally today.  Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through.",michael,49
6051,"You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate.",pam,10
6052,Did you explain why?,michael,4
6053,"No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot.",pam,9
6054,"Burned my foot, Pam.",michael,4
6055,Please stop popping my cast.  Thank you.,michael,8
6056,"So, where are you shipping your foot?",jim,7
6057,Ha ha ha.  So where are you shipping...,michael,9
6058,Your foot?,dwight,2
6059,"Thank you.  Pam, messages please?",michael,6
6060,You didn't have any.,pam,4
6061,"Really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and...",michael,16
6062,And do my job?,pam,4
6063,"No, your job is being my friend, Pam.  OW! God!",michael,11
6064,[holding mini-fan]  It slipped.,dwight,5
6065,What?,michael,1
6066,Sorry.,dwight,1
6067,"It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment.",pam,13
6068,"I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma.  I don't think that's too much to ask.",michael,37
6069,"Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy.",pam,11
6070,"No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy.  Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing.  I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.",michael,30
6071,"Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to.",dwight,19
6072,What?  Part of your duties are to what?,michael,9
6073,What?,dwight,1

6075,"No, I didn't.",dwight,3
6076,"Yes, you did.  What is wrong with you?",michael,9

6078,Where is my cornbread?,michael,4
6080,Thank you.  Did you get all dark meat like I like?,michael,12
6082,Where are the yams?,michael,4
6084,Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg?,michael,8
6086,And they had no yams?,michael,5
6088,How strange.  Because they always have yams.,michael,8
6089,"Aw, man, is that a Prism Duro-Sport?",dwight,7
6090,You've seen one of these?,pam,5
6091,"Yeah, they're like an i-Pod only they're better 'cause they're chunkier and more solid.",dwight,14
6092,Roy gave it to me for Christmas.  I'm trying to figure out how to put songs on it.,pam,19
6093,"Oh, no no no.  Don't go there.  I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece.",dwight,24
6094,Really?,pam,1
6095,"Yeah, I'll write down the address for you.  Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding!",dwight,24
6096,"Oh! Ha, haha.",pam,3
6097,"Why would they all be...?  Ok, see you later, Pan.",dwight,11
6098,Pan?,pam,1
6099,Pam... PAAAM!?,michael,2
6100,"Oh, God.",pam,2
6101,[phone rings] What.,pam,3
6102,Come here please.,michael,3
6103,Tell me before I come there.,pam,6
6104,I want you to rub butter on my foot.,michael,9
6105,No.,pam,1
6106,"Pam, please?  I have Country Crock.",michael,7
6107,No.,pam,1
6108,"Uh, ow.  Ryan! ... Ryaaaaan ... RYYYYAN!",michael,8
6109,These covers are totally indestructible.,dwight,5
6110,Really?,pam,1
6111,Yeah. Throw it.  I promise it won't break.  Chuck it. [Pam throws her mp3 player],dwight,17
6112,"Oh no, it's broken.",dwight,4
6113,What?!,pam,1
6114,"No, it's fine.  I told you it wouldn't break.  You could throw it all day long.",dwight,18
6115,That is so cool.  Thanks Dwight!,pam,7
6116,Yep.,dwight,1
6117,"So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.",jim,9
6118,"Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God!  Dwight's kind of my friend!",pam,16
6119,"No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom.  No, I'm not gonna call Jan.  She'd just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that?  No, it was mutual.  What is Pam doing chatting with you?",michael,47
6120,Huh. Do you like candy?,dwight,5
6122,Cause you're sweeter than candy.,dwight,5
6127,"[loud noise in bathroom] No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me!",michael,11
6129,I fell off the toilet.  I'm caught between the toilet and the wall.,michael,14
6131,"Ugh, not you.  Someone else.  Get Pam.",michael,9
6133,Get Ryan.  He needs to lift me. [Ryan shakes his head] and he needs to clean me up a little bit.  Bring a wet towel.,michael,27
6135,"No, he's not.",michael,3
6137,I just saw him.,michael,4
6139,"Ugh, forget it.  I'll just get up myself.  No!  Uh, aaaahhh!  Ah!  Oh God!",michael,19
6140,Do you think Dwight's bein' a little weird today?,jim,9
6141,"No, he's actually been really nice and helpful.",pam,8
6142,And that isn't weird?,jim,4
6143,Wow...,pam,1
6144,"Can I have everyone's attention please?  Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who's supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question?  Do you all know what it's like to be disabled?  Oscar?",michael,35
6146,"No, never heard of it.  No, a",michael,8
6148,"Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I'm sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.",michael,32
6150,"Ok, [lifts up cooked foot] what does this look like to you Stanley?!",michael,13
6152,"Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about.  You people are jerks.  Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me.",michael,41
6154,"[sigh] I burned my foot!!!  Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there!",michael,14
6155,[looking up at Creed] Dad?,dwight,5
6156,"While we are waiting for our special guest to arrive, I wanted you all to take a look at a few of the many, many disabled icons who have contributed so much to our society.",michael,35
6157,"Quick question: uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?",jim,10
6159,"Good question.  Forrest Gump: mentally challenged, Philadelphia [points to a picture from Big]: AIDS.",michael,15
6161,"I don't think so, no.",michael,5
6163,"He grew into a man overnight.  Rare disability, still works. [sigh] A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here?",michael,22
6165,What you mean uh hmmm... ?,michael,6
6167,Ok.,michael,1
6169,"Yes, right in here, come on in.",michael,7
6171,"This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.",michael,8
6174,You are so brave. You are so brave.,michael,8
6176,But it's hard for you! Right? Because you're in a wheelchair.,michael,11
6178,"Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?",michael,25
6180,"Oh my God, that's three times as long as it takes me.",michael,12
6181,How did you get in your wheelchair?,michael,7
6183,"Hey, hey, hey, not funny! Not funny.",michael,7
6185,"Well, that's good, he still has a sense of humor.",michael,10
6187,"Well they notice it.  Don't you?  You notice it.  It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it?",michael,25
6188,I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill.,jim,11
6190,Ok...,michael,1
6192,"Dwight, you have your hand up.",pam,6
6193,"Ignore him.  You know what?  We're not that different, you and I.  When I clamped my foot into a non-stick...",michael,23
6195,Yeah...,michael,1
6197,Ok.,michael,1
6199,Did you see Born on the Fourth of July?  I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy.,michael,23
6201,You mean today?  He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.,jim,16
6203,[popping his bubble wrap cast] Hey!,michael,6
6205,"You did it!  Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin.  Very nice.  Thank you, Ryan.",michael,21
6207,Did you get the yams?,michael,5
6209,"[sigh] Ok, I'll just have the pudding.",michael,7
6211,Yeh.,michael,1
6213,You know what?  I feel better.  Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.,michael,20
6214,"Yeah, baby, I am feelin' better.  My body's literally healing itself.  It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.",michael,29
6216,"Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.",michael,10
6217,"[hits his head on his desk]  Uh, ugh, ohhhh...",dwight,10
6218,"Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion.",jim,20
6219,"Oh, now you feel some compassion for him.",michael,8
6221,Why don't you go with him?,michael,6
6223,I want Michael to take me...,dwight,6
6224,"I can't take you, I don't have my car and yours is all vomity.",michael,14
6226,"Oh, ok, that's, great.  No, I can't drive.  Jim why don't you drive.",michael,15
6227,Fine.,jim,1
6228,"We'll go.  I'm still recovering. So let's just, Ryan, could you get my coat please.",michael,16
6229,"Slowly, slowly.  Let's just get to the elevator.",jim,9
6230,Choo choo choo choo choo choo...,dwight,6
6231,"What are you doing?  What, stop...",jim,7
6232,Vietnam sounds.,dwight,2
6233,"[Dwight falls onto the couch] Stop, stop, stop, stop.",jim,9
6234,Tired... [Jim grabs spray bottle from planter],dwight,7
6235,You can't lay down.,jim,4
6236,Want to take a rake... .,dwight,6
6237,Wake up. [sprays Dwight],jim,4
6238,Ahh!,dwight,1
6239,"Dwight, here, let me help you Dwight.",pam,7
6240,I'm just gonna get...,jim,4
6241,"Ok, Pam, thanks.",dwight,3
6242,"Get up, get up.",pam,4
6243,You're the best.,dwight,3
6244,Yeah.,pam,1
6245,Just keep him awake.,jim,4
6246,It smells like chicken soup.,dwight,5
6247,I know.,pam,2
6248,I have to go to the hospital.,dwight,7
6249,I know.,pam,2
6250,Where we going?,dwight,3
6251,I just want to say goodbye ok?,pam,7
6252,"I'll be back, I mean...",dwight,5
6253,"Yes, I know, but it's gonna be different.",pam,8
6254,Why?,dwight,1
6255,It's just hard to explain.,pam,5
6256,"Aw, Pam, you're adorable [taps her nose]",dwight,7
6257,Oh my goodness!,pam,3
6258,[giggles],dwight,1
6259,Come here.,pam,2
6260,"Oh, huggy hugs.",dwight,3
6261,Shotgun!,michael,1
6262,You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?,jim,11
6263,The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear.  The first person to shout 'shotgun' when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat.  That's how  the game's played.  There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.,michael,46
6264,"Oh, God, a mini-van.  What is Meredith's problem?",michael,9
6265,"Well, I think she has a kid.",jim,7
6266,"Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband.  She's not gonna find one driving this thing around.",michael,18
6267,Where are we going?,dwight,4
6268,"Come on, get inside.",jim,4
6269,Where are we going?,dwight,4
6270,We're going to Chuck E. Cheese.,jim,6
6271,"Chuck E. Cheese?  Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese.",michael,13
6272,"We're going to the hospital, Michael.",jim,6
6273,"I know, just sayin'.",michael,4
6274,"Dwight, what are you drinking?",michael,5
6275,I found it under the seat.,dwight,6
6276,"Oh my God, Dwight, put that down.",jim,7
6277,I'm thirsty.,dwight,2
6278,Give the bottle to Michael [sprays Dwight],jim,7
6279,No!,dwight,1
6280,Give the bottle to Michael!,jim,5
6281,I'm thirsty!,dwight,2
6282,Give it to me.,michael,4
6283,No.,dwight,1
6284,Dwight... [to Jim] You just keep your eyes on the road. [to Dwight]  Give me the bottle or you're fired.,michael,21
6285,"You can't fire me, I don't work in this van!",dwight,10
6286,Give it to me Dwight.,michael,5
6287,No. [takes a drink],dwight,4
6288,Give me the bottle!!,michael,4
6289,[to Michael] Will you stop?,jim,5
6290,"Gimme the bottle, Dwight!",michael,4
6291,Michael stop.,jim,2
6292,[drinks] Mmmmm...,dwight,2
6293,Just give it!,michael,3
6294,"Michael stop. [sprays Michael, then Dwight]",jim,6
6295,"Stop, stop it! Stop spraying! [Dwight whines] Gimme the bottle!",michael,10
6296,Stop [sprays Michael],jim,3
6297,My eyes!,dwight,2
6298,Stop spraying me!  Gimme the bottle!,michael,7
6299,My eyes!,dwight,2
6300,"Dwight, what is your middle name.",michael,6
6301,Danger.,dwight,1
6302,[sigh] Something with a 'K'.,michael,5
6303,"It's Kurt.  Wow, I am so sad that I know that.",jim,12
6304,What do I write under 'reason for visit'?,michael,8
6305,Concussion. [Michael scribbles something out] What did you write?,jim,9
6306,Nothing.  I wrote 'bringing someone to the hospital'.,michael,9
6307,So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.,jim,12
6308,"No... you know what Jim, this isn't about me anymore.  I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him. [Dwight falls towards Jim]",michael,29
6309,Come on Dwight. [sprays Dwight],jim,5
6310,Hi Michael!,dwight,2
6311,Hi Dwight.,michael,2
6312,Ahhh.  Mweehaa,dwight,3
6313,"Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?",michael,12
6315,"Well, you don't have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.",michael,23
6317,What is that?,dwight,3
6318,"Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?",michael,19
6320,"Ok, what kinda machine is that?",michael,6
6322,That's what she said.,dwight,4
6323,"That's my joke, damnit Dwight.",michael,5
6325,"It's ok, they're with me.",michael,5
6327,"Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off.",michael,11
6328,I don't want to do this.,dwight,6
6329,"Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up.  We'll, see you when you get out.",michael,27
6330,Oh.,dwight,1
6331,Fine. Fine.,michael,2
6332,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.",pam,5
6333,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim.",jim,5
6334,"Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?",pam,10
6335,"Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.",jim,16
6336,I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan.,pam,8
6337,Michael went in there with him too.  It's pretty sweet.,jim,11
6338,Really? Michael went in with him?,pam,6
6339,Uh huh.,jim,2
6340,Wow.,pam,1
6341,"But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon.",jim,12
6342,"Ok, that's uh, good news [Pam sees Angela eavesdropping] Uh, yeah, no I'll let you go.",pam,16
6343,Ok.,jim,1
6344,Ok. Bye.,pam,2
6345,Bye.,jim,1
6346,"Hey, Oscar?",pam,2
6348,"I just wanted to let you that Dwight's gonna be ok.  The doctor said there's a really simple treatment for a concussion, so he'll probably even be back at work tomorrow.",pam,32
6350,"I just, uh, thought you'd want to know that.",pam,9
6400,Not much what's up with you?,jim,6
6401,"Oh, I can not believe I fell for that. [laughing] Oh, my God.",pam,13
6402,"Ah, ah, ah, what? What? Where's the funny? Give it to me.",michael,12
6403,"Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?",jim,12
6404,What's up-dog?,michael,2
6405,Nothin' much what's up with you?,jim,6
6406,"Oh, oh, wow! I walked right into that. Oh, that's brilliant!",michael,11
6407,"Hey, Stanley, is that jacket make of up-dog?",michael,8
6409,"Mmm, what flavour coffee is that?  Up-dog?",michael,8
6411,"I don't know, nothin', what's up with you?",michael,8
6413,"[low] No, damn it!",michael,4
6415,What does what mean?,michael,4
6417,Just forget it.,michael,3
6418,Dwight! Hey is it me or does this place smell like up-dog?,michael,12
6419,What's up-dog?,dwight,2
6420,"Gotcha! [laughing] Oh, God. [low] Crap! Nothin' how ya doing?",michael,10
6421,Good. How are you doing?,dwight,5
6422,[mouthing] So close.,jim,3
6423,[low] Damn it.,michael,3
6425,Empty mind.,dwight,2
6426,"No, that's not... no, that's not what I was going to say.",michael,12
6427,"Meredith, men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes.  They're worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar?",dwight,24
6429,That's unacceptable.,dwight,2
6432,Michael.,dwight,1
6433,Yes.,michael,1
6434,Oscar is out sick.,dwight,4
6435,On a Friday? [Dwight nods],michael,5
6436,Can I do some of the talking?,dwight,7
6437,I will do all the talking.,michael,6
6438,"Ok, let him know that I'm here.",dwight,7
6440,What difference does it make whether your here?,michael,8
6442,"Hi, Oscar its Michael.",michael,4
6443,And Dwight.,dwight,2
6444,"Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather?",michael,9
6446,"Really? Oh, that is a shame.  You know it's cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic.",michael,24
6448,Ask him his symptoms. I'm on Web M.D.,dwight,8
6449,What are your symptoms?,michael,4
6451,"Umm, hmmm.",michael,2
6453,Checks out.,dwight,2
6455,I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday.  Unless you're still sick.  So have a great long weekend.,michael,29
6457,Ok. First impressions?,dwight,3
6458,He sounded sick.,michael,3
6459,Which is exactly how you'd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.,dwight,17
6460,That's exactly what I was thinking.,michael,6
6461,Question? May I investigate?,dwight,4
6462,Yeah. Drop what you're doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can't function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.,michael,24
6463,I bought my veil.,pam,4
6465,Ummm...,pam,1
6467,"Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don't know, like loose with big curls and...",pam,20
6469,"Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don't you wear your hair like that all the time.  It's much sexier. [Pam puts hair back up] [Michael walks by Jim] Man, this must be torture for you.",michael,34
6470,Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant.,jim,37
6471,Hey Michael.,jim,2
6472,Hey Jim-bag.,michael,2
6473,Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.,jim,30
6474,Really?,michael,1
6475,"Umm, hmm.",jim,2
6476,Who else knows?,michael,3
6477,Nobody.,jim,1
6478,Wow!,michael,1
6479,"Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship.  And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can.",michael,51
6480,My lips are sealed. [singing] My lips are sealed... Bangles.,michael,10
6481,Alright. Great. Thank you.,jim,4

6500,"Alright, well, cool. [Michael walks by Jim] Still deciding?",michael,9
6502,[Michael presses a button for Stanley] Peach iced tea. You're going to hate it.,michael,14
6503,"Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling.  Listen a little question for you, buddy.  I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy.",dwight,56
6504,"There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth.  The liar will perspire.  Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful.",dwight,55
6505,It's Grrrrrrape! Soda.,michael,3
6506,Tony the tiger.  You don't hear that much any more.,jim,11
6507,Not so much.,michael,3
6508,"Ok, what is going on here?",dwight,6
6509,Nothing.,michael,1
6510,"Oh, really nothing? Fact: You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda.  Fact: You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim.",dwight,26
6511,Fact: I love grape soda. I always have. Fact: Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets.,michael,21
6512,Ok. So what is the secret Michael?,dwight,7
6513,"Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.",jim,26
6514,Is that true?,dwight,3
6515,"Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.",michael,9
6516,Thank you Michael.  I know your telling the truth.,dwight,10

6523,"Oh nonsense [lifts leg and puts it on Jim's desk], no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat.",michael,25
6524,"No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.",jim,17
6525,Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room.  Have a little picnic order some 'za. Talk about you know who.,michael,30

6533,Nope we're not brothers.,jim,4
6534,I'm his boss actually.  And I treat him well. I'm taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.,michael,28
6535,"Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.",jim,10
6537,"Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?",michael,8
6539,"Mmmm, sounds yummy.  I will have a chicken breast hold the chicken. [Giggles]",michael,14

6549,Three.,dwight,1
6550,"Ok, it was the second one.",pam,6
6551,"Ok, good, thank you.  That wasn't so hard now was it?",dwight,12
6552,Nuh-uh.,pam,1
6553,What do you like best about Pam?,michael,7
6554,"Uh, I really don't want to talk about it.",jim,9
6555,"Is it her boobs, or...",michael,5
6556,"Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor.",jim,17

6576,I hate you.,pam,3
6577,Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.,dwight,12
6578,Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.,michael,20

6580,Just do it.,michael,3
6582,[Michael messes up hair to look like Jim's] Expenses.,michael,9

6587,"Yeah, it's a business lunch.",michael,5
6589,No he did not. I don't need his permission.,michael,9
6591,"Uhhh it's ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don't understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right?",michael,35
6592,I put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter.  And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us.,michael,19
6594,"Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity.  How is that not work related?",michael,24
6596,"You're not his friend, you don't know. He is in love with a girl he works with who's engaged.  So just cut me some slack. Please?",michael,27
6603,"You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me.",michael,25
6604,"As a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years.  One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me.  So I tailed her for six straight nights.  Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved.",dwight,48
6606,Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I [hesitate] don't. Riveting.,jim,21

6617,Oh.,pam,1
6618,"Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.",jim,19
6619,Right.,pam,1
6620,"And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.",jim,19
6621,"No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started.",pam,18

6633,This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this?,dwight,7
6636,How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor.  Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.,dwight,30
6637,"Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage.  Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake.",dwight,50
6638,Hey.,jim,1
6639,"I know, I know, I know.",michael,6
6640,"Umm, what happened?",jim,3
6641,"I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. I'm just, I just hope that, I just hope that [starts to get choked up] this doesn't affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid.",michael,47

6654,"No, I feel it's my responsibility as your boss slash friend.",michael,11
6655,"No, really, it's okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so.",pam,26
6656,It wasn't that long ago. It was on the booze cruise.,michael,11
6657,Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?,pam,20

6946,Who is this?  How did you get this number?,michael,10
6948,Oh my God.  Packer.  Packster.  Whacky Pack.  How you doin'?,michael,14
6950,Uh... no.  Did anybody see a package here today?  No.  How big was it?,michael,17
6952,Really?,michael,1
6954,Did you see a big package?  Where did you leave it?,michael,12
6956,"Really?  Guys, did you see a big package in my office?",michael,12
6959,Are you kidding me?  Oh!,michael,6
6961,"That was Packer!  Oh, you're... you are dead.  You are dead, my friend!  That is hilar... Oh, God!  Of course it was you.",michael,27
6963,"Oh.  [laughs and claps] Yeah, yeah!  Oh my God.  It was Packer!",michael,15
6964,"It takes an advanced sense of humor.  I don't expect everybody to understand.  It was done out of love, just like I thought.  It's ah... God, these people are so... these are good people.  We have fun. [giggles] We just have fun!  Oh, I'm just so sorry that I threw the thing out.",michael,58
6966,"[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, Jim.  It's Pam.  I keep looking up to say something to you and then Michael's there and it's horrible.  Anyway, I'm bored.  Come back!",pam,33
6967,"[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, guess what?  I moved my computer so I can't see Michael's head.  It's working.  I think I can have a career as a very specific type of decorator.",pam,36
6968,"[voicemail message for Jim]  Sudoku. Level moderate. 18 minutes. Suck on that, Halpert.",pam,14
6969,"[voicemail message for Jim] I'll transfer you.  Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Hold, please.  Dunder Mifflin, this is ... okay, sorry.  Michael was standing at my desk, and I needed to be busy or who knows what would've happened, so thank you.",pam,46
6970,"[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, what's that word we made up when you have a thing stuck in your shoe?  Anyway, I have a thing stuck in my shoe.",pam,30
6971,"[voicemail message for Jim] Hey, I have a chance to sneak out of here early, and I'm not messing this up, so I'll see you tomorrow.",pam,26
6972,"[voicemail message for Jim] Calling from my cell phone.  I don't know if you guys figured out who did that to Michael's carpet yet, but I have a theory that involves an inter-departmental conspiracy.  Everybody in the office.  We need to talk.",pam,45
6982,Hey.,jim,1
6984,"So, you used to share that cubicle with Kelly, right?",jim,10
6986,"And then you just changed desks, right?",jim,7
6988,To one without a cubicle.,jim,5
6990,"So, you just couldn't take it anymore, huh?",jim,8
6992,"So, that's how it's gonna be.",jim,6
7054,Today's a 'women in the workplace' thing. Jan's coming in from Corporate to talk to all the women about... um... I don't really know what. But Michael's not allowed in. She said that about five times.,pam,36
7056,"[knocks] Hey, what's going on?",michael,5
7058,Yeah... I... You know what... I... I... I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.,michael,22
7060,"Hold... Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today's woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads...",michael,30
7062,"No, just uh... you have come a long way, baby.  But I just... just want to keep it within reason.",michael,21
7064,They did this up in Albany...,michael,6
7066,And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so...,michael,16
7068,"Well, I'm their boss, so I feel like...",michael,8
7070,[stands up] Anybody want any coffee or...,michael,7
7072,"Women in the workplace... yeah, translation 'I have been banned from my own conference room so that Jan can talk in secret to all the girls.' Oh! Sorry. 'Women of the workplace.' About what? I don't know. Clothes. Me. Eeegkh!",michael,40
7074,Jan.,pam,1
7076,Michael's still at the door.,pam,5
7079,It's a terrible idea.,dwight,4
7080,What is?,jim,2
7081,Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.,dwight,25
7082,"Everyone. Guys. Circle up, please. Come on over. Bring your chairs. Toby, come on over. You're a guy... too... sort of. Let's do this!",michael,24
7083,"[in the background] Well, first of all, I, uh, just want to warm up a little bit. Let's just clap.",michael,20
7084,Let's just clap. Ready? [clapping] Yeah! Yeah!,michael,7
7085,Yeah!,dwight,1
7086,That's what I'm talking about!,michael,5
7088,Just having a little 'guys in the workplace' thing.,michael,9
7090,Why can't boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?,michael,21
7092,We have nowhere else Jan. This...,michael,6
7093,We could do it in the warehouse.,dwight,7
7096,"Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months.",michael,28
7097,Remember on Lost when they met the Others?,dwight,8
7099,Mmmhmm.,pam,1
7101,"So let's meet the warehouse! Let's get some shots. Pan around there. This is Darryl, one of our warehouse staff. Darryl, what is your biggest fear?",michael,26
7103,"You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There's Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And... uh, she's our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing.",michael,42
7105,Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina... Roy...,michael,8
7107,Roy and Pam. It's a Ram. It's a Ram thing.,michael,10
7109,"Thanks for the head's up, Kev.",jim,6
7121,I don't know how I fit in with these women. Here. Or with Jan. Um... I mean we get along great. Fine. Um... I guess the person I have the most in common with is...,pam,35
7123,"Oh, no, no. No.",jim,4
7125,Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely.,jim,4
7127,Yeah. I like talking to her too.,jim,7
7129,Yes. Yeah.,jim,2
7131,"Yep. Cool, man.",jim,3
7135,"Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I don't think... You.. You're... My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there.",michael,26
7137,Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?,michael,7
7138,Okay. Let's go. Step up.,dwight,5
7139,Check this out! Look at that! Look at that [squeezes blow-up doll] bwup-bwa! [talks in girly voice] Hello! How are... [regular voice] Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff.,michael,31
7148,Michael wants us to bond so we need topics for conversation.,dwight,11
7149,Ponies.,jim,1
7150,No.,dwight,1
7152,No.,dwight,1
7153,Flowers.,jim,1
7155,"Hey, you're going to, going to hurt yourself.",michael,8
7157,Stand clear.,michael,2
7159,"I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine.",michael,6
7161,"Oh, oh, oh!  We'll get somebody to clean that up.",michael,11
7164,We ought to have this thing serviced.,michael,7
7165,"So! Guy's gripe session. Here we are. Now, we definitely live in different worlds but we have a lot in common. We even like the same girls, some of us. That's going to happen, you know. We're guys, so...",michael,39
7167,"No, why? Why would I... ? You could...",michael,8
7169,Stay or...,michael,2
7176,Thanks.,pam,1
7178,"Well... I have a job right now, so I can't really take time off...",pam,14
7180,"Well... it's just that the weekends aren't good because, um...",pam,10
7182,"Let's start with the Warehouse. What bothers you as guys, you know?",michael,12
7184,OK.,michael,1
7186,"OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh...",michael,5
7188,I... That was just...,michael,4
7190,I was breathing.,michael,3
7192,"I hate shushing. You know, that's the thing! What the... ok... what is our beef as human men.",michael,18
7194,OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That's what guys do... and we love it.,michael,16
7204,Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like 'Gas ain't free!',dwight,17
7206,I feel you.,michael,3
7208,Not literally.,dwight,2
7210,Yes.,michael,1
7212,"Ah, you do. So...",michael,4
7214,Word.,dwight,1
7216,I know. God! What is that?,michael,6
7218,"It blows. It blows, man. Gah...",michael,6
7221,"No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah.",michael,4
7226,You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys.,michael,15
7229,Dockworker's?,michael,1
7233,Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.,michael,11
7235,The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.,michael,10
7237,Yeah-es.,michael,1
7241,"[knocks] This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna... Can I help you? Um... I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points...",michael,37
7243,Don't get hysterical.,michael,3
7245,Part of my job is knowing how to talk to women.,michael,11
7246,Let's... be... rational... here. What are the pros? What are the cons?,michael,12
7248,Don't talk to me that way please. Just... they're going to want to hear this from you.,michael,17
7250,But we're bonding down there!,michael,5
7252,I mean I just don't want to have to tell them something they're not going to want to hear.,michael,19
7254,Ok. Come on Jan. After all we've been through...,michael,9
7256,We have a history...,michael,4
7258,...between us.,michael,2
7260,I won't,michael,2
7262,I'm just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever.,michael,8
7276,Hey.,pam,1
7277,Hey!,jim,1
7278,How's it going down there?,pam,5
7279,"It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls?",jim,15
7280,Good. We watched a video about our changing bodies.,pam,9
7281,Did you really?,jim,3
7282,No. [laughs],pam,2
7283,Oh.,jim,1
7284,Almost.,pam,1
7285,Good.,jim,1
7286,"Um... but hey? Something kind of cool. There's this internship in graphic design that Jan was telling us about. She made it sound, like, really great.",pam,26
7287,"Nice. Well, what's it all about?",jim,6
7288,Um...,pam,1
7289,I think you should do it. That's great!,jim,8
7290,It's really cool.,pam,3
7291,"Cold front coming into the Warehouse. Uh oh! Better put on your ski boots! Woohoohoowoo. Waaaah! Happy New Year, Darryl! Hey,Darryl. You ever done this?",michael,25
7302,Hi.,michael,1
7304,"Yuh, yuh, yes! I... I have essentially...",michael,7
7306,I have essentially. Yes. I've taken some...,michael,7
7309,So you're not doing it.,jim,5
7310,How did you know?,pam,4
7311,Why not?,jim,2
7312,Just like no big reason. Just a bunch of little reasons.,pam,11
7313,Come on.,jim,2
7314,Roy's right. There's no guarantee it's going to lead to anything anyway.,pam,12
7315,Roy said that.,jim,3
7316,What? You have something you want to say?,pam,8
7317,"You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?",jim,21
7318,"Oh, excuse me! I'm fine with my choices!",pam,8
7319,You are?,jim,2
7320,Yeah.,pam,1
7321,"It's impractical. I'm not going to try to get a house like that. Um... they don't even make houses like that in Scranton. So, I'm never going to... .",pam,29
7322,I'm just going to put this over there.,michael,8
7324,You did uh... okay.,michael,4
7325,Pizza. Great equalizer. Rich people love pizza.  Poor people love pizza.  White people love pizza.  Black people love pizza.  Do black people like pizza?,michael,28
7326,"Hey. Um... look guys, I'm sorry. Sometimes Jan can be such a bitch.",michael,13
7328,"Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship.",michael,9
7329,Thank you to our hosts.,michael,5
7331,Ahhh! Excellent.,michael,2
7332,Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.,michael,40
7333,"Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh... hold, please.",pam,8
7363,"I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwight's head on it, it was horrifying and funny and...",pam,39
7364,[Delivery man enters with a bouquet of red roses. Pam stands up to look at card.] Phyllis.,pam,17
7366,"Roy and I are saving for the wedding, so I made him promise not to get me anything too big.",pam,20

7371,And you want me to come with you.,dwight,8
7372,Nope. The opposite of that.,michael,5
7373,I will stay here and run things on this end.,dwight,10
7374,"Ok, good.",michael,2
7375,Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?,dwight,11
7376,"I probably will, why do you ask?",michael,7
7377,"Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know...",dwight,9
7378,Yeah.,michael,1
7379,Screwed.,dwight,1
7380,What,michael,1
7381,"This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine's Day. It's New York. City of Love.",michael,46
7382,"Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything?",michael,14
7383,That's OK.,pam,2
7384,Alright.,michael,1
7386,"Dude, I'm gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!",michael,17
7387,"Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name.",michael,26
7388,"So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great.",jim,54
7389,What's this? What is this?,dwight,5
7390,"I dunno, it's on",jim,4
7391,"Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?",dwight,10
7392,It was there when I sat down.,jim,7
7393,[opens box and reads card] Happy Valentine's Day. [pulls out bobble head] It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes! [Angela smirks in background] Ahh!,dwight,24
7394,"The meeting isn't 'til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I'm gonna go get me a New York slice. [Michael walks toward Sbarro.]",michael,48
7395,Hey Kelly. What's up?,jim,4
7397,"OH, that's great. I'm really happy for [starts to walk away]",jim,11
7399,Wow.,jim,1
7401,Wow.,jim,1
7403,"No, don't be.",jim,3
7405,I bet.,jim,2
7407,Alright. [Kelly squeals],jim,3
7411,Guess what?,pam,2
7413,That's great. [Meredith scowls],pam,4
7414,"Everybody takes the subway in New York. It's fast, it's efficient, gets you there on time. It's a way to [turns and rushes back up stairs] Okay, there's a guy pooping in a cardboard box down there.",michael,37
7416,"Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten.",dwight,18
7418,Oh I did. I did.,dwight,5
7420,"Oh, I bet you will before the day is over.",dwight,10
7423,"[on phone] Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.",jim,36
7426,"OH, Holy God!",pam,3
7431,There they are. What's up? Hey hey.,michael,7
7434,"Josh Porter, high five. [They high five] Bam.",michael,8
7436,"Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers. [bump fists]",michael,13
7438,"You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?",michael,14
7440,So what's going on? What I miss?,michael,7
7442,"Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and... [awkward silence]",michael,14
7443,"Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you... privately?",dwight,14
7444,"You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here.",pam,10
7445,"No, Pam, Just. Just, [tilts head away, towards another room]",dwight,10
7446,You need to get something for your girlfriend.,pam,8
7447,"[same time as Pam] Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of...",dwight,42
7448,Tightly wound?,pam,2
7449,(smirking) Exactly.,dwight,2
7450,"Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.",pam,21
7451,"You mean, like a ham?",dwight,5
7452,"No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.",pam,20
7453,"Ok, I get it.",dwight,4
7454,That you remember her.,pam,4
7455,"Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do. [gets up and leaves]",dwight,13
7462,"Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it.",michael,10
7464,"Maybe because she's my girlfriend. [starts retracting statement] Was, or not my girlfriend. She's... we hooked up and...",michael,18
7466,"You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it,",michael,12
7468,"Yeah, yeah.",michael,2
7470,Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need... [Ryan walks in],jim,19

7483,Ditto. [to Jan] How are you Jan?,michael,7
7491,"What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more. [plays video on screen. David and Jan have confused looks on their faces.]",michael,38
7493,"Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about.",michael,34
7495,Questions?,michael,1
7497,"Yes, thank you.",michael,3
7499,"Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm... [hands over report]",michael,12

7510,"Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.",jim,27
7523,"Oh, ok. Alright.",michael,3
7525,No you're not.,michael,3
7527,"Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So...",michael,9

7532,"Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.",dwight,51
7534,Hey.,pam,1
7536,"I guess, yeah.",pam,3
7538,"Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.",pam,20
7540,"I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you'd get me",pam,19
7543,"No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously. [Jan looks at Michael]",michael,58
7545,"I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. [David grins]",michael,25
7547,"I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again.",michael,32
7550,Heading out?,pam,2

7562,Michael's got a few tricks for Valentine's Day. He found a place where you can get 12 plastic roses for $10 and he's got a great line. 'Me so thorny.',pam,30
7563,"I love you, Angela. Yes, even you. I love you, Kelly. I love you, Meredith. This is all platonically, of course.",michael,21
7564,"I love ladies, always have. And you know what I think is the most attractive part of a woman's body? The brains. Because I don't think a woman is beautiful unless she is smart. And also, the brains are where the ladies get their best nasty ideas for bedroom stuff.",michael,50
7608,"Dwight lives on a beet farm and he practices karate at the forth grade level. And he apparently has a girlfriend, so... I guess there really is someone for everybody.",jim,30
7613,Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then...,michael,11
7614,They are either going to say yes... or no.,dwight,9
7615,Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say.,michael,13
7616,Think it through.,dwight,3
7617,Have to think it through. Because if they say no...,michael,10
7618,Can we not?,jim,3
7619,"No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long. [Michael starts playing with a football in the office] Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh! [laughs] Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted.",michael,53

7633,"Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so...",jim,42
7634,What did I do to deserve this?,jim,7
7635,Are you sad that Dwight beat you?,pam,7
7636,No.,jim,1
7637,"Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue?",pam,11
7639,Oh! I... uh... yeah. Um... I'll uh show them to you later.,pam,12
7641,"Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.",jim,10
7642,"Ok, cool.",pam,2
7643,I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I don't want to offend... Angela... or someone.,pam,49
7644,That's what she said!,michael,4
7645,Ha! I don't get it.,dwight,5
7646,Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?,michael,11
7647,"Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right?",dwight,11
7648,"Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um... And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life.",michael,22
7650,"What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, 'Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very...'",dwight,21
7651,That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.,michael,20
7652,"When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'.",dwight,34
7653,I can't do this.,dwight,4
7654,"That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.",michael,37
7655,"Oh, okay.",dwight,2
7656,But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company.,michael,15
7657,"Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked.",dwight,10
7658,"Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.",michael,10
7659,I'll try and think of one. When...,dwight,7
7660,Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot.,michael,19
7661,Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?,dwight,13
7662,Insult.,michael,1
7663,"Mom, I'm sorry. I know you and Dad are chipping in for the wedding but I do not want orange invitations. Yes! Well, if you really want my...",pam,28
7664,"Hi, yeah, can I talk to one of your travel agents?",jim,11
7665,I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.,jim,21
7666,Where do I want to go? Um... that is an excellent question. And one I should have probably thought about before I called you. Um...,jim,25
7668,"[stand up comic voice] But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?",michael,15
7669,Saleswoman has a vagina.,dwight,4
7670,"It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a Sex Ed class.",michael,10
7671,But I'm right?,dwight,3
7672,"Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right? [stand up comic voice] The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!",michael,36
7673,Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?,dwight,9
7674,I do. Both of them.,michael,5
7675,Could I have a copy of one of them?,dwight,9
7676,"No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.",michael,32
7677,Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!,michael,30
7678,Yeah!,dwight,1
7679,[generalized clapping and cheering] Congratulations.,michael,5
7681,"You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them.",michael,16
7682,That is so great about the bonus!,dwight,7
7683,"No, no! It's not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up. They're a great audience.",michael,25
7686,Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.,dwight,39
7687,Do we know anyone who was in the accident?,pam,9
7688,Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses.,dwight,8
7690,They are unrelated.,dwight,3
7692,"He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing.",dwight,10
7695,Yes.,dwight,1
7697,He's kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny... and it was just horrible.,michael,19
7699,Yeah.,michael,1
7701,All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it.,michael,13
7704,You mean Toastmasters?,pam,3
7705,"Pam! I'm public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.",michael,18
7706,"Yeah, the bride doesn't really do... Have you ever been to a wedding?",pam,13
7707,Can I go?,jim,3
7708,Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative.,michael,6
7709,So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?,jim,31
7711,What is that?,jim,3
7713,"I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.",jim,14
7715,Oh ho hokay. You know what? That's not a toast. You're not standing up.,michael,14
7717,When did you go there?,jim,5
7719,Really for like how long?,jim,5
7722,Where do I want to go?,jim,6
7725,"Okay, Dwight. Show us what you have learned today.",michael,9
7726,"Good morning, Vietnam! [general groaning] Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates.",dwight,24
7727,No. We're not.,jim,3
7728,"Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager.",dwight,8
7729,Which means absolutely nothing.,jim,4
7730,"Michael, can you explain?",dwight,4
7731,"Well, it's mostly made up. So...",michael,6
7732,Dwight is not going to do a job. It's sad. And they're expecting excellence because I did do such a good job. Two years in a row. I killed. It was amazing.,michael,32
7733,"Confidence, Dwight.",michael,2
7734,Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?,jim,13
7735,I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone.,dwight,36
7736,Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.,jim,10
7737,Oh please! You're not taking any trip.,dwight,7
7738,You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.,jim,9
7739,You did?,dwight,2
7740,Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.,jim,24
7741,Yes. I am.,dwight,3
7742,"The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.",jim,29
7743,Which is?,dwight,2
7744,You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point.,jim,21
7745,"Ok, I didn't actually major in Public Speaking. But, I did download speeches from some of history's famous dictators. Like this one [holds up paper]. Originally given by Benito Mussolini.",jim,30
7746,"Ok, look. I know you are giving this speech on your own",jim,12
7747,I'll glance at it.,dwight,4
7748,"It's time, Dwight. The grim reaper is here.",michael,8
7750,"Thank you, Angela.",dwight,3
7752,Roy has a connection. It's nicer than you think.,pam,9

7762,"Dwight, they called your name.",michael,5
7764,"No, I can't... I ca...",dwight,5
7765,All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. I'm going to cover for you. [shouts] All right!,michael,25
7769,Maybe we'll use a DJ. That's the one thing Roy's in charge of for this wedding but all he's managed to do is set a date.,pam,26
7773,"Ryan, you should be more sensitive. It's obvious she likes you and comments like that, they just...",pam,17
7775,"I'm very sorry. I did not know you were wearing a hearing aid and I just thought you were speaking abnormally. ...And now the black guy from the 'Police Academy' movies. A robot. [makes robot sounds] Michael Winslow, anyone?",michael,39
7776,"Car starting. [makes car sounds]  All right, Dwight Schrute everyone.",michael,11
7778,Good luck. That is a tough crowd.,michael,7
7781,WE ARE WARRIORS!,dwight,3
7783,"Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!",dwight,17
7785,[laughs maniacally] Yeah. Yes!,dwight,4
7787,Maybe. Thanks.,jim,2
7789,Yeah. I'm definitely going.,jim,4
7792,No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself. [bangs fists],dwight,12
7796,Australia? I have always wanted to go there?,pam,8
7797,"I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.",jim,27
7798,That's awesome. Where are you staying?,pam,6
7799,I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but...,jim,17
7800,When are you leaving?,pam,4
7801,I'm... leaving on June 8th.,jim,5
7802,Oh.,pam,1
7803,"Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just...",jim,9
7804,Oh yeah. That's too bad.,pam,5
7805,Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?,jim,12
7806,It's ok. I got it.,pam,5
7807,Alright.,jim,1
7808,"Ok, thanks. [to Michael] There you are. What happened?",dwight,9
7809,I got thirsty. How'd it go?,michael,6
7810,It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.,dwight,10
7811,You would not believe what happened here.,michael,7
7812,What? Something happened?,dwight,3
7813,"Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.",michael,28
7814,Weird.,dwight,1
7815,"Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.'",michael,29
7816,Con artist.,dwight,2
7817,She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?,michael,43
7818,"Dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?",michael,40
7836,"All right, listen up, please. Dwight has a joke.",michael,9
7837,[whispering to Angela] Stop it. [to the office] Two sailors walk into a bar...,dwight,14
7839,"Oh, why not?",dwight,3
7841,Iraq is sand. Sailors are on water.,michael,7
7842,"Yes, but they are both in danger.",pam,7
7843,"Yeah, well, you know what? We need to... All right, everybody in the conference room now. Let's go.",michael,18

7870,"Okay. They got sports medicine seminar, nope. Science fiction convention, nope.",michael,11
7871,"Oh, yeah, I read about that. The entire cast of Battlestar Galactica is gonna be here, including Starbuck. I'm so in love with her.",dwight,24
7872,You're weird.,michael,2
7873,"No, no, no. It's totally normal, 'cause she's not a Cylon or anything. She's just a great human fighter pilot. If I see her, my heart will explode.",dwight,28
7874,Are you a 12-year-old girl? I don't know. There we go.,michael,11
7876,"I'm looking forward to 'Take Your Daughter to Work' day. I am not great with kids, but I wanna get better. Because I'm getting married. So, I put out a bunch of extra candy out on my desk so the kids will come talk to me. ...Like the witch in Hanzel and Gretel.",pam,53
7877,Bribery. Nice.,jim,2

7895,You are the future!,dwight,4
7899,"Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you've really grown up. You know what? Don't mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the... frat boys away from her.",michael,39
7901,Oh.,michael,1
7903,"Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.",michael,10
7904,"It's not that children make me uncomfortable, it's just that, why be a dad when you can be a fun uncle? I've never heard of anyone rebelling against their fun uncle.",michael,31
7905,[while Jake is throwing things at Michael] They want how many spiral pads?,michael,13
7907,Okay.,michael,1
7919,"[on phone] Just compare last year's order to this year's. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm looking at it right now. [Sasha walks in the door] ... Yes. We--yeah, they're very--they're different.

7931,Really?,jim,1
7933,"Yesss. And you're Abby, right?",jim,5

7937,Let's start with... your mom.,jim,5
7940,Nice to meet you.,michael,4
7942,"Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I'm the conductor. [blows into whistle] But I'm sort of the conductor of the office here, right? [blows into whistle] You want to try?",michael,36
7944,"All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu...camonga! [Sasha and Michael laugh]",michael,11
7945,"[shaking hands with Abby] Ow, ow, ow, ow, you broke my hand.",jim,12

7999,"No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.",michael,39
8001,"Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate...",michael,12

8131,[singing] You... who are on the road... must have a code... that you can live by... [Dwight joins in] and so... become yourself... because the past... is just a goodbye... and teach... your children well...,michael,35
8132,Why does he own a guitar if he doesn't know how to play?,jim,13
8133,I think he thought his ukulele skills would transfer. [Jim leaves],pam,11
8135,"My theory is that... [Jim signals he's leaving, waves bye to Pam]",pam,12
8137,"And they do, your parents, love you very much.",dwight,9
8138,One more time. [singing] You...,michael,5
8139,"The Schrutes consider children very valuable. In the olden days, the women would bear many children, so we would have enough laborers to work the fields. And if it was an especially cold winter, and there weren't enough grains or vegetables, they would eat the weakest of the brood. [Laughs] They didn't eat the children.",dwight,55
8169,"Didn't do background checks of the warehouse guys. [exclaims] Well, I'm sure it'll be fine.",michael,15

8203,"So, Phil recruited me to sell these cards, and now I am recruiting you.",michael,14
8205,Don't worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves.,michael,26
8207,"You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend.",michael,18
8209,Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!,michael,11
8211,"You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich. [Jim and Dwight raise their hands] Alright.",michael,45
8212,"No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?",jim,9
8214,Happy birthday Michael.,pam,3
8215,Oh ho ho! What?,michael,4
8216,I said happy birthday.,pam,4
8217,Thank you! That's really nice.,michael,5
8218,"Today is my B-day, and people around here just go crazy for it. I don't know why. Oh! Fun fact. I share my birthday with Eva Longoria. So, I have a",michael,31

8231,Mmm. Maybe I should get one.,dwight,6
8232,Good luck. One of a kind.,michael,6
8233,Ebay. Hm. Question! May I be in charge of the party planning festivities?,dwight,13
8234,"Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it.  They've been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.",michael,19
8235,"Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the...",dwight,10
8236,"Don't! Nope! Please, don't want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise.",michael,13
8237,Let's get the party started. [Begins 'raising the roof'],dwight,9
8238,Let's get the party started.  Not the way I taught you! [Michael joins in],michael,15
8240,One's good.,pam,2
8242,"Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority.",dwight,19
8244,Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by. [hands list to Pam],dwight,21
8245,Michael wants a strippergram?,pam,4
8246,"Yes, but he doesn't want to know when, or whom.",dwight,10

8254,"It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.",michael,14
8256,"Really? 'Cause, I thought we had the same birthday.",michael,9
8258,Thanks. [grins],michael,2

8262,Somebody brought in donuts for my birthday!,michael,7

8280,Mmm.,michael,1
8286,"Here we go. Ohhhkay, this is great! [giggles] Thank you my friends, she is perfect! Ahhh, Dwight, may I have your chair please? And, um, some singles, if you will! Allllright. Nnnnn-dink!

8288,[laughing] Okay. I'm so nervous.,michael,5
8289,I can sign for it.,pam,5

8293,"It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song.",dwight,12
8294,"Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.",michael,29
8295,I probably care more than she does.,dwight,7
8296,You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this [points to James Dean poster].,michael,19
8297,When does he hear?,pam,4
8298,Sometime today.,jim,2
8299,Ohh... poor Kevin.,pam,3

8303,"Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.",dwight,25
8304,"[grinning] Ohhh, God.",michael,3
8305,There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.,dwight,17
8306,"Ohhh, no.",michael,2
8307,So come help me celebrate Michael's birth moment. Kevin!,dwight,9
8309,"Ohh, no, no, no! I can't... Ryan, come on. Let's do this.",michael,12
8310,Creed! Come on. Stanley!,dwight,4
8311,...I feel like we should go get Kevin something. Do you think we can sneak out of here?,pam,18
8312,"Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...",jim,11
8313,"On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready?",dwight,8
8314,Okay.,michael,1
8315,"Happy birth moment, Michael.",dwight,4

8332,"Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup.",dwight,5
8333,The best.,michael,2
8335,Yes.,michael,1
8337,"Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good.",michael,10
8339,"Just the bread, it's fresh baked.",michael,6
8341,Mm-kay. Get whatever you want. [under breath] And choke on it.,michael,11
8343,"So. We got Kev some stuff. Um... a party pack of M&M's, his favorite candy. A DVD of American Pie 2, which is his favorite movie, and, he lent it to Creed, so, I can guarantee you he won't get that back.",jim,42
8344,Sixty-nine cup of noodles.,pam,4
8345,"Which we realize sounds crass, but, it... is his favorite number.",jim,11
8346,And his favorite lunch.,pam,4
8347,"Hey temp, you know uh, we still got five feet of sandwich left [pulls ice cream cake out of freezer].",dwight,20
8349,"Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake.",dwight,8
8351,Oh. I got it.,dwight,4
8353,[whispering] This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything.,dwight,14
8355,What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?,dwight,8
8357,[whispering] But what if i'm hungry?,dwight,6
8359,[puts fabric softener into cart] ...What?,jim,6
8360,You use fabric softener?,pam,4
8361,"Yeah, you don't?",jim,3
8362,"No, I do.",pam,3
8363,...Okay.,jim,1
8366,Kevin? Respect the birthday please.,michael,5
8368,Are you done? ...Good. Okay.,michael,5
8369,Here we go. Make a wish.,dwight,6
8370,Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm... [blows out the candles],michael,11
8371,Yaoo yay! [claps],dwight,3
8372,... I asked for trick candles.,michael,6
8373,Pam was supposed to get 'em.,dwight,6
8374,"Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again. [notices Meredith hugging Kevin] Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day.",michael,26
8376,"... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, that's good timing. That's... that's, sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible... terrible news for both of us [takes cake into office and slams the door].",michael,33
8377,[checking watch] We should probably head back.,pam,7
8378,Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.,jim,10
8379,You dare me? How old are you?,pam,7
8380,Just... quit stalling.,jim,3
8381,"[over loudspeaker, imitating Darth Vader] Luke, this is your father. Come set the table for dinner.",pam,16
8382,Such a dork.,jim,3

8385,Oh I'm sorry. I'm sorry.,pam,5
8386,How old are you?,jim,4
8387,I hate you.,pam,3
8389,There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.,michael,20
8391,"Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.",michael,23
8393,And laughter... also.,michael,3
8395,Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party.,michael,13
8397,"[mocking voice] Nyeh, I work here. [to Kevin] Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.",michael,42
8399,"Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.",michael,12
8400,"Where have you been? And don't say the bathroom, 'cause I kicked in all the stalls.",dwight,16
8401,"Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.",jim,12
8402,"Please, don't.",dwight,2
8403,You... owe me.,jim,3
8404,"Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.",michael,35
8406,How dare you sir. You are gross.,michael,7
8407,[sees 'Happy Birthday Michael Scott!' poster at skating rink] That should not be there.,michael,14
8408,I'll get someone to take it down.,dwight,7
8409,"No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on!",michael,18
8412,Think you can let go?,jim,5
8413,No. [laughs],pam,2
8414,Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. [Michael skates by],jim,8
8415,YEAH!,dwight,1
8416,Who is that?,pam,3
8417,Is that Michael?,jim,3
8418,"Yeah, I've been pretty much skating my whole life. I thought about playing in the NHL, but, you're on the road so much. You got no time to spend with your wife and kids. And I really want a wife and kids.",michael,42
8419,I got it.,pam,3
8420,"Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.",michael,44
8421,...It's something to think about.,jim,5
8423,Kevin. You heard anything yet?,michael,5
8425,Okay. Well. Live strong.,michael,4
8427,Alright.,michael,1
8429,"Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or...",michael,16
8431,"Oh, these... all your kids?",michael,5
8433,"Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay?",michael,14
8435,Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now!,michael,20
8436,Push. Good! That's great. You got it. [Kevin's phone rings] Excuse me.,michael,12
8438,"Oh... God... [stomps] God! [throws hockey stick and yellow paper bracelet down] We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna... come here [hugs Kevin].",michael,23
8439,"Well, apparently in the medicine community, negative means good. Which makes absolutely no sense. In the real world community, that would... be... chaos.",michael,23
8441,"Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!",michael,9
8442,Turn it around. Turn it around.,dwight,6
8443,Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.,michael,5
8444,Number one!!,dwight,2
8445,Thank you... Dwight. That's great. Thanks.,michael,6
8446,Michael?,pam,1
8447,Yeah.,michael,1
8448,This is from all of us.,pam,6
8449,Oh! You didn't need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it.,michael,17
8450,Michael's birthday was actually pretty cool. It was a good day. I don't know... It was a good day.,pam,19
8454,"Michael's birthday is hard for me because he gets very excited. But he's also under a lot of pressure, which builds up until he's ready to explode. As his right-hand man, it's my job to release that pressure so that he can enjoy himself, if only for a moment.",dwight,49
8463,"To think that a man's skin could turn on him. It's brilliant, 'cause you'd never expect it. Most people think of their skin as an ally. [scoffs] Makes me rethink having skin at all.",dwight,34
8476,"Kevin Malone, you're next. Spit that out. [Kevin shoves the rest of the donut he's eating into his mouth] Spit... Okay, come on, let's go.",dwight,25
8477,"You look cute today, Dwight.",jim,5
8478,"Thanks, girl.",dwight,2
8479,"So, yesterday Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot. Which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight",jim,20
8480,"Let's go over some of the symptoms of marijuana use, shall we?  You tell me who this sounds like: slow moving, inattentive, dull, constantly snacking, shows a lack of motivation.",dwight,31
8482,"I like the people I work with generally, with four exceptions.  But someone committed a crime and I did not become a Lackawanna County Volunteer Sheriff's deputy to make friends. And by the way, I haven't.",dwight,37

8484,"[laughs] Jim does the best impressions. Sometimes he'll look up at me from his desk and he'll just be someone else. Like he'll go um, [makes mournful face, giggles] that's supposed to be Phyllis.  I can't do it as good as he can.",pam,44
8486,"Stop! This is not Kelly Kapoor story hour.  Illegal drugs were consumed on company property, okay? Your ass is on the line, mister!  My ass is is on the line!  Now I'm going to ask you again.  What time did you go home last night?",dwight,49
8488,I didn't know that you were at a party on Saturday night.,dwight,12
8490,"Okay, I'm gonna need to search your car.  Give me you keys.",dwight,13
8492,Don't make me do this the hard way.,dwight,8
8496,"Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow.",michael,30
8497,I can't stop this investigation. It is my job.,dwight,9
8498,Whoa. You are a volunteer.,jim,5
8499,I volunteered for this job.,dwight,5
8500,And that's not the same.,jim,5
8501,It is my duty...,dwight,4
8502,[interrupting] Volunteer duty.,jim,3
8503,...to investigate the crime scene. I have six more interviews to go and then I will reveal what I know.,dwight,20
8504,[fake coughing] Narc!,michael,3
8506,If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job.,dwight,15
8507,I wasn't attempting to compliment you.,michael,6
8508,"Well, you have...",dwight,3
8509,"Uuf, well...",michael,2
8510,...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...,dwight,14
8511,[shakes head] Okay...,michael,3
8512,...and I am very proud of being a narc.,dwight,9
8513,"Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God! [to Jim] Dude, where's my office? [Jim quietly laughs] I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!",michael,42
8514,"Well, your office is behind you.",jim,6
8515,Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?,michael,6
8517,Oscar visited Mexico when he was five to attend his great-grandmother's funeral. What does that mean to a United States law enforcement officer? He's a potential drug mule.,dwight,28
8518,Have you ever taken any illegal drugs?,dwight,7
8520,Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?,dwight,21
8522,Have you ever... pooped... a balloon?,dwight,6
8524,He sure left in a hurry.,dwight,6
8525,I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.,dwight,23
8526,Do you know what this is? [pushing a photo toward her],dwight,11
8528,How do you know that?,dwight,5
8530,[grabs pictures back and looks at it] Dammit.,dwight,8
8532,"No, it's marijuana.",dwight,3
8533,I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.,jim,12
8534,"That's ridiculous, of course it wasn't me.",dwight,7
8535,"Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.",jim,12
8536,I would remember.,dwight,3
8537,"Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?",jim,10
8538,That's not how it works.,dwight,5
8539,Now how do you know how it works?,jim,8
8540,"Knock it off, okay, I'm interviewing you.",dwight,7
8541,No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?,jim,22
8542,[opens eyes wide in total surprise],dwight,6
8544,"Oh, um...[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?  [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly]",jim,30
8546,"Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.",jim,10
8548,He does everyone in the office.,pam,6
8551,Jinx! Buy me a coke.,pam,5
8552,Oh...,jim,1
8553,"No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke.  Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid.  [Jim puts money in drink machine, selection is sold out]",pam,41
8554,Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.,pam,11
8555,[mouths] C'mon!,jim,2

8560,Where were you yesterday after work?,dwight,6
8562,Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling?  Ratting somebody out.  Narc!  Narc!  Kevin?,michael,15
8564,"Remember the narc bit? [laughs] Uh-oh, who's in trouble?",michael,9
8565,Attention everyone.  Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.,dwight,16
8566,Waa... what? What are you talking about?,michael,7
8567,Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.,dwight,18
8571,"Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled.  Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.",michael,25
8572,No you can't do that.,dwight,5
8573,"I can do that, it is my office.",michael,8
8574,"No you cannot. It has to be official, and it",dwight,10
8575,Hmmm. Ha. [under his breath] Alright. Great.,michael,7
8576,"Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?",dwight,9
8578,"Angela, what about you?",dwight,4
8580,You're not on,dwight,3
8582,Good.,dwight,1
8584,"Hey guys, what's going on?",pam,5
8586,"Oh, okay.  Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. [Jim shakes his head. Seems relieved to be getting away from Kelly] But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. [Jim nods his head as if to say, 'Gee, thanks, Pam.']",pam,54
8588,It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.,michael,21
8592,"No, uh, no. That was a test.  I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him?  How many of you said, 'Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.'",michael,55
8593,"Thank you, Michael.",dwight,3
8594,"I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.",michael,22
8597,"Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?",michael,9
8599,Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?,michael,16
8601,"Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?",michael,24
8603,Yes it is.,michael,3
8605,"Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? [Pam throws her hands up to indicate she has no notepad] In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.",michael,39
8607,"I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.",michael,11
8609,"Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.  Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one.  Yeah, Pam.",michael,46
8610,I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.,pam,22
8611,Really? [Jim shakes his head no],michael,6
8612,"Uh, hmmm.",pam,2
8614,Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.,pam,14
8615,"The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.",michael,50
8616,"No, you will be tested.",dwight,5
8617,"Yes, I will not be.",michael,5
8618,You will be. That is the law according to the rules.,dwight,11
8619,"Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.",michael,46
8620,"Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy.",dwight,27
8622,Mine was green.,dwight,3
8624,I'm all better.,dwight,3
8625,So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.,michael,22
8626,What kind of filing?,dwight,4
8627,Just forget it.  Just the urine.,michael,7
8628,That goes directly to the tester.,dwight,6
8629,Just. I need your urine.,michael,5
8630,Like in a cup?,dwight,4
8631,"Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.",michael,8
8632,For what purpose?,dwight,3
8633,It's none of your business.,michael,5
8634,Then I refuse.,dwight,3
8635,"Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.",michael,29
8636,Are you serious?,dwight,3
8637,I need clean urine for the lady.,michael,7
8638,But that's illegal.,dwight,3
8639,"Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes",michael,23
8640,Not my urine.,dwight,3
8641,A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.,michael,16
8642,Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?,dwight,9
8643,"No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup.",michael,10
8645,I want him to have all the urine he needs.,dwight,10
8647,I know that. Don't you think I know that?,dwight,9
8657,"Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much.",michael,17
8658,That's great.,dwight,2
8659,What's wrong? Where's your costume?,michael,5
8660,It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.,dwight,14
8661,Why?  Wha...,michael,3
8662,I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.,dwight,15
8664,Hi.,jim,1
8665,Hey.,pam,1
8666,How much time do you have left on your break?,jim,10
8667,Ten minutes.,pam,2
8668,"Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.",michael,34
8669,Really?,dwight,1
8670,"Yes, sir.",michael,2
8671,That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .,dwight,12
8672,So you wanna? Thanks.,michael,4
8674,Okay.,michael,1
8676,"Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. [To Hank]  Can I have a gun?",dwight,14
8678,"Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff.",dwight,9
8680,Good.,michael,1
8681,"[salutes] Thank you, Michael.",dwight,4
8682,No. Oh. Uh...[awkwardly salutes],michael,4
8683,I need to go over some details with you.,dwight,9
8684,"Alright. [to Hank] Well, Thank you.",michael,6
8685,"First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?",dwight,12
8687,"Oh, God.",dwight,2
8688,Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk.  Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael?  I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?,jim,53
8774,No.,pam,1
8776,"Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.",jim,40
8778,Yeah?,pam,1
8780,"Oh, thanks!",pam,2
8782,Uh...,pam,1
8783,"There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ...  it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy.",pam,36
8784,"Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam's. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We're doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent.",michael,21
8788,Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?,dwight,10
8790,Clown paint.,dwight,2
8791,"I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?",dwight,53
8792,That's a nice tie.,michael,4
8794,That is... who makes that?,michael,5
8796,Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?,michael,10
8799,[walking into the Conference room] What's the dealio?,michael,8
8801,What's the problem?,michael,3
8805,"So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?",michael,13
8808,Yes.,michael,1
8810,Yeah?,michael,1
8812,Okay.,michael,1
8814,What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...,michael,16
8816,Okay... what?,michael,2
8818,"Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized. [leans over to Pam] Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?",michael,41
8819,"[holding up a binder] A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.[in a comedic voice] My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.",michael,35
8821,"No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.",michael,10
8823,"Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?",michael,38
8825,"Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.",michael,31
8826,"[in front of poster] Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using 'I' emotion language and no judging or 'you' statements.",michael,33
8828,"Come on, seriously, that?",michael,4
8830,"Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.",michael,20
8831,Win!,pam,1
8832,"Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.",michael,34
8835,"Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution.",michael,6
8838,"How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?",pam,11
8839,"Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.",michael,49
8840,Win.,pam,1
8843,[claps his hands twice] It is done!,michael,7
8844,Win,pam,1
8847,"Hey, Angela.[hands her a Save The Date card] I didn't have your zip code.",pam,14
8851,Yes.,michael,1
8853,Are those all the other complains?,michael,6
8855,I would like to see those please.,michael,7
8857,"You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.",michael,22
8859,"Okay. [yanks the file away, despite Toby's resistance] There! No more conflict. [looks at the camera] I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. [looks back at Toby] All right... is that it?",michael,36
8862,Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?,michael,10
8864,"Oh, he's sure. Just shoot.",dwight,5
8866,"[looking through papers in the complaint box] This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.",michael,57
8867,Nice.,pam,1
8868,You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.,michael,12
8874,"Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.",michael,21
8875,"Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?",dwight,18
8876,[notices Angela's intense concern] Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?,pam,17
8877,"All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And [looks through the file]... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.",michael,31
8878,"Wait, what did it say?",pam,5
8879,"Uh... [reading]'Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?' [Pam looks Angela an angry look] Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?",michael,37
8880,I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!,pam,25
8881,"Here is a Kelly complaint: 'Ryan never returns my calls.' Ugh, join the club.",michael,14
8887,[crumbles up the complaint paper] Makin' progress. [Jim raises his hand] Yes?,michael,12
8888,Dwight tried to kiss me.,jim,5
8889,What?!,michael,1
8890,And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.,jim,15
8891,That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!,dwight,8
8892,"Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.",jim,17
8893,"Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?",dwight,22
8895,Stanley. [off camera],michael,3
8896,"[gets up and walks over to Angela, whispering to her] Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!",pam,16
8897,[still of camera] You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.,michael,19
8899,I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.,pam,21
8900,"Someone complained that the men's room is 'whites only'. Stanley, you know that's not true.",michael,15
8903,"Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.",michael,20
8905,"And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.",michael,14
8908,Oh... ok.,michael,2
8910,"I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.",pam,29
8911,"Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.",jim,17
8912,Don't take her side.,pam,4
8913,"[sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?",jim,8
8914,I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.,pam,14
8915,You mean your thoughts and feelings?,jim,6
8916,Yeah.,pam,1
8917,Yeah...,jim,1
8921,"Okay, well... all settled, then.",michael,5
8923,"OK, Ryan.  You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?",michael,14
8925,"All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution:  Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.",michael,35
8927,"Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.",jim,14
8928,That doesn't make any sense.,dwight,5
8929,"Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.",jim,21
8931,No.,dwight,1
8932,"I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.",dwight,32
8933,This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.,jim,21
8934,This is humongous. I am not a security threat...,dwight,9
8935,Oh.,jim,1
8936,"And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.",dwight,8
8937,What did I write?,jim,4
8938,I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.,dwight,8
8940,What box?!,dwight,2
8943,Uh. Dwight.,michael,2
8944,"Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.",dwight,14
8945,Okay! Calm down.,michael,3
8946,No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?,dwight,14
8947,"Hey, hey!",michael,2
8948,Him or me?,dwight,3
8949,Stop.,michael,1
8950,Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.,dwight,9
8951,Okay...,michael,1
8952,"Either he goes, or I go.",dwight,6
8953,Dwight...,michael,1
8954,You choose!,dwight,2
8955,Stop...,michael,1
8956,One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out],dwight,14
8957,Oh... kay...,michael,2
8958,I am not bluffing!,dwight,4
8959,Okay.,michael,1
8960,Okay?,dwight,1
8961,Yes.,michael,1
8962,"Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.",dwight,14
8963,Mm-hmm.,michael,1
8964,I deserve this. You know I do!,dwight,7
8965,[picks up Dwight's I.D. and snickers] You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?,michael,15
8966,You have till five.,dwight,4
8967,"Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!",dwight,43
8968,"Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!",michael,18
8969,"Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.",michael,21
8970,"Okay, so Dwight, in your own words - [reads from complaint paper] 'Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert.' [flips to another paper] 'Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to.'",michael,43
8971,[laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.,jim,11
8973,"That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.",jim,32
8974,"[reading] 'Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'.'",michael,10
8975,"Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.",jim,21
8976,"By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier.'",michael,16
8977,"Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.",jim,24
8978,"The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful.",michael,41
8979,Maybe Stanford would be cool.,jim,5
8980,It's a good market. Higher volume.,dwight,6
8981,Yeah. Maybe we should both go.,jim,6
8982,I have a girlfriend...,dwight,4
8983,"Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.",jim,5
8984,"Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later.",michael,12
8985,"So, you going to transfer Jim or not?",dwight,8
8986,"Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.",michael,9
8987,I want an answer by tomorrow.,dwight,6
8988,"Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?",michael,12
8989,Fine.,dwight,1
8990,Good. Okay.,michael,2
8991,Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?,michael,10
8993,"Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?",michael,7
8995,It'll take like two seconds.,michael,5
8997,"Ugh... All right. Everybody, [looks around at the employees] come on. Group photo for the newsletter.",michael,16
8999,"Come on, everybody.",michael,3
9000,"Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.",dwight,10
9002,"We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.",michael,9
9004,"Good, let's check that out. [looks at preview screen] Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more.",michael,19
9006,What?,michael,1
9007,"Angela, I want to talk to you about something.",pam,9
9008,[off camera] You just press the button.,michael,7
9010,"No, Pam.",jim,2
9011,[looks at to Jim] I am. [looks at Angela] It's about the Save The Date.,pam,15
9012,"Pam, it wasn't her.",jim,4
9013,What?!,pam,1
9014,I'm the one who complained about you.,jim,7
9015,I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.,jim,18
9016,"[off camera] Okay, good. Check that out.",michael,7
9017,"You know, it was one day.",jim,6
9018,[off camera] That's terrible.,michael,4
9019,And I took it right back. It was like...,jim,9
9020,Okay.,pam,1
9022,"[off camera] Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger. [rejoins the group, on camera] Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. [flash goes off before he sits down]",michael,32
9023,It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.,michael,24
9024,"[flashback the photo being taken] One, two..[flash goes off] Didn't say three, did I?",michael,14
9025,"But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems.",michael,31
9026,"[on Pam's answering machine] Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. [camera shows Jim sitting on a waiting coach in another Dunder Mifflin office]",jim,48
9028,"Oh, thanks.",jim,2
9029,And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.,michael,36
9079,Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?,jim,12
9080,"I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.",dwight,12
9081,It's a nice tux.,pam,4
9082,"I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.",dwight,15
9084,"Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert.",pam,11
9085,"Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.",dwight,14
9086,I can always kind of win at roulette.,jim,8
9087,"Oh, really? Mmm-hmm.",dwight,3
9088,Yeah.,jim,1
9089,How would you do that?,dwight,5
9090,Mind control.,jim,2
9091,[laughs] You can't be serious. Are you serious?,dwight,8
9092,"Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.",jim,20
9093,I don't believe you. Continue.,dwight,5
9094,"It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.",jim,28
9095,"[scoffs] That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.",dwight,37
9096,"Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]",jim,19
9097,"Oh, my God.",dwight,3
9098,I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing.,michael,16
9100,Top 80 percent!,michael,3
9102,Yeah?,michael,1
9104,"Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!",michael,13
9106,"Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.",michael,36
9108,"I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.",michael,12
9110,"Oh, come on. Come on.",michael,5
9112,"You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.",michael,16
9114,"Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.",michael,31
9115,"Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.",michael,12
9117,"Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts.",michael,13
9119,"Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.",michael,48
9120,Yes!,dwight,1
9121,"So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.",michael,15
9122,That doesn't exist anymore.,jim,4
9123,"Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.",michael,9
9124,"No, they stopped making that show.",pam,6
9125,"Well, then, they need our money more than ever.",michael,9
9131,"Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna...",michael,29
9134,I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.,jim,8
9135,"No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.",michael,6
9137,What?,michael,1
9139,That's a dog.,michael,3
9140,"No, that's Afghan.",pam,3
9141,That's a shawl.,michael,3
9142,"Wait, canine AIDS?",dwight,3
9143,No. Humans with AIDS.,michael,4
9145,"Guys, the Afghanistananies.",jim,3
9146,"Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.",michael,15
9147,"There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. 'I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head.' [laughs] And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams.",michael,58
9148,What are you doing?,jim,4
9149,"Oh, nothing.",pam,2
9150,Till Death Do Us Rock.',jim,5
9151,They're wedding bands.,pam,3
9152,Oh.,jim,1
9153,"Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now.",pam,16
9154,"Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.",jim,57
9155,There's a KISS cover band in here.,pam,7

9507,"OK, a little too far, crossed the line.",michael,8
9509,I would have never called him that if I knew.  You don't... You don't call retarded people 'retards'.  It's bad taste.  You call your friends 'retards' when they're acting retarded.  And I consider Oscar a friend.,michael,40

9711,"Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker.",michael,29
9712,And your veil.,dwight,3
9713,"Yeah, do it!",michael,3
9714,I'll probably just wear this.,pam,5
9715,"Really? Okay. Well, word of advice: unbutton that top button. Let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim?",michael,23
9716,Um...,pam,1

9733,"Hey, Josh, how ya doing?",michael,5
9735,"Good to see you. There he is! There's the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product... the progidal... my son returns.",michael,25
9736,"I was shocked when he told me he was transferring to Stamford. It's like the firemen. You don't leave your brothers behind, even if you find out that there is a better fire in Connecticut.",michael,35
9737,"It's really good to see you, man.",jim,7
9738,"Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too!",michael,12
9739,"Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet?",dwight,13
9740,"Yeah, sold about forty thousand.",jim,5
9741,Hey!,michael,1
9742,Shut up. That's impossible.,dwight,4
9743,"No, it's not. I did. Yep.",jim,6
9744,"Well, I did it too.",dwight,5
9745,"You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.",jim,39
9751,So what kind of commissions you get up there?,dwight,9
9752,"Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much.",jim,7
9753,You're so immature!,dwight,3
9755,Ah.,michael,1
9758,"Hey, Jan.",dwight,2
9764,"Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules.",michael,11
9766,"The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. I'm still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention.",michael,21
9768,Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you.,michael,12
9770,Mm-hmm.,pam,1
9772,This party is going to be awesome.,dwight,7
9773,I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic.,michael,17
9774,Check it out.,dwight,3
9775,That is crooked on that side.,michael,6
9776,Wow.,dwight,1
9777,Hey hey!,michael,2
9778,That is a lot of liquor.,jim,6
9779,Yeah.,michael,1
9780,And a dart board.,jim,4
9781,"Well, that's how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain't no party like a Scranton party, 'cause a Scranton party don't stop.",michael,26
9783,"Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen?",michael,10
9785,"Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there.",jim,23
9786,Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I'd love to be a part of one someday.,michael,16
9788,Yeah.,jim,1
9789,"All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up.",michael,13
9790,"I'll do a shot, Michael.",dwight,5
9791,"Ugh, that would be gross. It's not even lunch yet.",michael,10
9792,SWAG! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my SWAG.,michael,17
9793,"Check it out. Hi, I'm Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin.",michael,8
9794,"Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin.",dwight,6

9800,"Well, cool! Okay, so... can I tell people you're gonna be there?",michael,12
9802,So maybe. See ya.,michael,4
9803,Why do they call him The Bus?,dwight,7
9804,Because he's afraid to fly.,michael,5
9805,Smile!,dwight,1
9806,"Do you remember me from last year? There's a party in my room, 308, can't miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there!",michael,24
9808,"Yep. Yeah, she's up front.",michael,5
9809,You don't have email on your phone.,dwight,7
9810,"I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello?",michael,9
9811,No one just called you.,dwight,5
9813,"All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.",jim,8
9816,[into phone] See you in a bit. Bye-bye. [to Dwight] May I have a moment of your time please?,michael,19
9817,I need you to do something for me.,michael,8

9819,I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.,michael,20
9820,"I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.",dwight,10
9822,Hey! What's up?,pam,3
9824,"[answering phone] Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He's not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too. [hangs up] Sorry. What's up?",pam,25
9826,"Okay. Well, if you think of it, I'll be here.",pam,10
9828,"So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera.",dwight,27
9829,And?,michael,1
9830,He wasn't volunteering today.,dwight,4
9831,Business has been pretty crazy around the office.,michael,8
9832,Oh yeah?,jim,2
9833,Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk.,michael,7
9834,"Oh, tell him I say hi.",jim,6
9835,I will call him later with that message.,michael,8
9836,"Hey, how is... Toby?",jim,4
9837,Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left?,michael,16
9838,"Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...",jim,18
9839,"Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically.",michael,37
9840,"Michael, it's really not a competition.",jim,6
9843,"Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip.",michael,10
9844,Whoa. Michael.,dwight,2
9846,You're welcome.,michael,2
9847,Was that your per diem?,dwight,5
9848,"No, that was a different hundred dollar bill.",michael,8
9850,I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.,michael,12
9852,"The party I'm having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited.",michael,11
9858,Any messages for 308? All right.,michael,6
9859,"Hey hey, fellers.",michael,3
9860,Michael.,jim,1
9861,"Hey, Michael.",dwight,2
9862,What's up?,michael,2
9864,"Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton.",michael,14
9866,"Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.",michael,13
9868,Okay! Excellent. Oh...,michael,3
9869,Keep the wing flaps.,dwight,4
9870,"Shut it. [answering phone] Hey, Pam, what's up? Yep, yech... no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes. [to others] Say hi to Pam!",michael,28
9872,"Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim. [to others] Pam says hi. [into phone] Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye.",michael,27
9873,You first.,michael,2
9874,"Come on. Nice try, Josh!",dwight,5

9877,"Well, let's...",michael,2
9879,Come on!,michael,2
9881,Come on!,michael,2
9884,Fine.,michael,1
9885,"Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think it's talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it's moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, I'm done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work.",michael,51
9887,"Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for.",michael,9
9889,"Sorry, my meeting ran late.",michael,5
9891,"Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill.",michael,8
9893,Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.,michael,21
9894,Yes! Ha!,dwight,2
9896,"Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me.",michael,9
9897,Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.,jim,14
9899,"Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!",jim,29
9904,So how do you come up with your cartoons?,pam,9
9906,You dream in cartoons? How fun!,pam,6
9907,"Hey, first guest! You are going to have some tequila, my friend.",michael,12
9909,This is the party.,michael,4
9911,"Party central! So, what can I do you for? [Guy leaves] All right.",michael,13
9913,Huh.,pam,1
9915,Freedom fries. Yeah.,pam,3
9917,"Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan.",pam,11
9919,More freedom fries.,pam,3
9921,That's great.,pam,2
9923,"I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, I'll just kinda know.",pam,22
9924,Michael. Am I the first to arrive?,jim,7
9925,People have been filtering in and out.,michael,7
9926,Can I get a drink?,jim,5
9927,What?,michael,1
9928,Can I get a drink?,jim,5
9929,Sure. You like Cosmos?,michael,4
9930,Yeah.,jim,1
9931,"Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?",michael,11
9932,Michael...,jim,1
9933,"I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that's just...",michael,34
9934,"Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss.",jim,16
9935,I'm not better than Josh.,michael,5
9936,"Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam.",jim,9
9937,Oh my God. You don't even know. She's single now.,michael,10
9938,"No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.",jim,26
9939,"I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her.",michael,14
9940,"Nope, that's okay.",jim,3
9941,Yeah.,michael,1
9942,That's all right.,jim,3
9943,"I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling.",michael,21
9944,"Yeah. Okay, maybe.",jim,3
9946,"Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out.",michael,11
9947,Hey.,jim,1
9948,"Evan, this is Jim.",michael,4
9949,How are you?,jim,3
9951,"Hey, Ernie, how ya doing?",michael,5
9953,"No, we used to. Now we're friends.",jim,7
9954,Best friends.,michael,2
9955,"Some people need dozens of friends to say, 'Hey, look at me, I'm popular.' But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly.",michael,49
9956,"Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir? [lights go out, leaving Michael's black light on] Ha, ha, ha.",michael,22
9957,"Ha, ha, ha, ha.",dwight,4
9958,Whoa. What are those stains?,michael,5
9959,"Blood, urine, or semen.",dwight,4
9960,"Oh, God, I hope it's urine.",michael,6
9961,"Today I'm headed to Philadelphia for the annual Northeastern Office Supply Convention. [makes horns gesture and heavy metal scream] Wooo-yaaaaah! Oh, these things tend to be kind of crazy.",michael,29
9962,[Angela enters Michael's office] Ah.,michael,5
9964,"Per-diem. [singing as he signs] Perrrr-diiiiieeeemmmm! [shows off $100 bill to Ryan] You know, Ryan, it's all about the Benjamins.",michael,20
9966,[points to door] Right there.,michael,5
9968,"Yes. What? Oh, yeah, have Pam give those to me.",michael,10
9970,Sure you don't want to come?,michael,6
9972,Gonna be fun! Change your mind we can get you a cot.,michael,12
9975,See that factory?,michael,3
9976,Mm-hm.,dwight,1
9977,I almost worked there.,michael,4
9978,No!,dwight,1
9979,"Yup. Yeah, I applied for a job there.",michael,8
9980,What would you have done? Been manager?,dwight,7
9981,I was going to be a bottle capper.,michael,8
9982,You? A bottle capper?! [laughs in disbelief],dwight,7
9983,"I know, I know. Crazy world. Crazy, crazy world.",michael,9
9985,"Josh reminds me of a guy I went to high school with. Big football star, girls loved him. Whatever. Guess what he's doing now. He's a TV announcer for the Eagles. Up in the... [laughs] He doesn't even get to play in the game, I mean.",michael,46
9986,"So, you ever been convicted of a felony?",dwight,8
9988,Misdemeanor?,dwight,1
9990,Coast Guard? So you know how to fight underwater?,dwight,9
9997,[waiting on Pam to be done with the microwave] Ahhhhhhhhh. [whispering loudly] I'm hungry.,michael,14
9998,Movie Monday!  The only cure I know for the Monday blues is... Varsity Blues!,michael,15
9999,"Let's gooooo! Let's go, let's go, let's go!",michael,8
10000,[directing people to their assigned seats] Take a seat down there.  Second from the end.,dwight,16
10001,"Alright, everybody here?  Yes.",michael,5
10002,[walking in with a tray of six popcorn bags] Popcorn anyone?,pam,11
10003,Yes pleeeeease!  Thank yooouuu!,michael,5
10004,[with five popcorn bags left] Anyone else?  Nooo.,pam,9
10005,"Movie Monday started with training videos, but we went through those pretty fast.  Then we watched a medical video.  Since then, it's been half hour installments of various movies, with the exception of an episode of Entourage, which Michael made us watch six times.",pam,46
10006,Entourage!,michael,1
10007,"Kevin, would you like to do the scenes from last week?",michael,11
10009,Why him?,dwight,2
10010,Don't whine.  Get the window. [Dwight exhales],michael,8
10011,Previously on Varsity Blues...,michael,4
10014,Not everyone approves of Movie Monday.  I won't say who.,dwight,11
10017,[Jan walks in on Movie Monday] Hi Jan!  Hope you brought the Milk Duds!,michael,15
10019,People work faster after...,michael,4
10021,No... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie.,michael,15
10025,That's not going to happen.,dwight,5
10027,That's not his fault!  He had to follow his heart!,dwight,11
10028,"Ever since Michael dumped Jan for Carol, Jan's been bitching out on him.  Reject a woman and she will never let it go.  One of the many defects of their kind.  Also weak arms.",dwight,37
10030,Michael would never let me...,dwight,5
10032,I could never do that!,dwight,5
10036,"[on the phone] Hey Kelly, my stuff just got here. [Kelly screams with excitement into the phone and Pam has to take it away from her ear]",pam,27
10037,"Kelly really likes to online shop.  Soooo, I felt like I wanted some new clothes.  I mean, I just, I wanted to, it just, I felt like it was time, to maybe um... just get new clothes.",pam,39
10038,[pulling her new shirt out of a box] Ok.,pam,9
10040,Really?  I don't know.,pam,5
10042,"Not at work, I'll try it on---",pam,7
10044,...noooo,pam,1
10046,Why did you do that?!,andy,5
10047,"I'm just killing Germans, any way I can.",jim,8
10048,We're on the German team.  Shoot the Brittish.,andy,9
10049,"[turning around to Karen] Wait, are we playing teams?",jim,9
10051,"[outside in the parking lot, pacing back and forth] WAH!  GAH!  [breathing heavily]",dwight,15
10053,Is this Jan?,dwight,3
10055,This is Dwight Schrute.  I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.,dwight,13
10057,It's about Michael.,dwight,3
10059,[exhales] I can't talk here.  It's too sensitive.,dwight,9
10061,"No, but we should discuss that another time.",dwight,8
10063,"Pull over at exit 40.  There is a Liz Claiborne outlet.  I know you like that store.  Go inside and shop, until I can meet you.",dwight,29
10065,Many of your blouses are Claiborne's.,dwight,6
10067,Part of my job.,dwight,4
10069,...noted.,dwight,1
10070,[walking into Michael's office] I'm going... to the dentist.,dwight,9
10071,Ok.,michael,1
10072,I have to have an emergency crown put in.,dwight,9
10073,Ouchy.,michael,1
10074,Yes.  It's a new dentist.  He's far.  I might be gone... three hours.,dwight,16
10075,"Three hours, wow.  Have fun.  [Dwight walks away staring through the blinds at Michael]",michael,16
10076,Did you get anything good?,dwight,5
10078,New blouse?  Halter top?  Camisole?  Teddy?,dwight,9
10079,I can save the branch.,dwight,5
10081,If you let me run it.,dwight,6
10083,[excitedly] 'Ok' I can run it?,dwight,6
10085,Mostly get rid of waste.  Which is half the people there.  And clean house.  [to waitress in diner]  Right here.  It's all for me.  Thank you.,dwight,32
10088,"[shoveling waffles into his mouth] Oh, by the way.  There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here.  I know you like their earrings.",dwight,26

10095,...what?,michael,1
10097,...you were at the dentist?,michael,5
10099,Ok.,michael,1
10100,What was Dwight thinking?  That he could turn Jan against me?  She's my ex-lover!  ...ish.,michael,18
10104,[smiling] It's too much.,pam,4
10106,I'm gonna return it.,pam,4
10109,Hi.,pam,1
10111,Thanks.,pam,1
10113,"Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company.  [someone dims the lights, signifying that it's game time]  Ok, see you next week.  Bye.  [to Karen] Again?",jim,34
10117,Now?,andy,1
10119,Put the game on hold everyone.,andy,6
10121,It's the new guy. [looks at Jim],andy,7
10122,"Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about...",jim,10
10123,See what I mean?,andy,4
10125,"Um, sniper rifle?",jim,3
10127,WHAT?,andy,1
10129,Are you playing for the other team?!,andy,7
10131,Saboteur!,andy,1
10133,Saboteur!  I'm going to kill you for real.  This game--- the game is over.  I'm really going to shoot you.,andy,23
10134,Hey Dwight.,michael,2
10135,Hey.,dwight,1
10136,Do you want an M&M?,michael,5
10137,No thanks I'm stuffed.,dwight,4
10138,"No seriously.  You should have an M&M, they're really good.",michael,11
10139,...ok. [takes and eats several M&M's],dwight,6
10140,"They're good, huh?",michael,3
10141,...so good.,dwight,2
10142,Hey.  I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in.,michael,21
10143,"They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so...",dwight,10
10144,Sounds like a good dentist.,michael,5
10145,"Oh, yeah.",dwight,2
10146,What's his name?,michael,3
10147,[long pause] Crentist.,dwight,3
10148,Your dentist's name is Crentist.,michael,5
10149,Yep.,dwight,1
10150,Huh.  Sounds a lot like dentist.,michael,7
10151,Maybe that's why he became a dentist.,dwight,7
10152,Let me see your teeth.  Let me see 'em.  Let me see 'em.,michael,15
10153,[reluctantly opens his mouth and Michael peers inside]  Ahh.  Aaaah.,dwight,12
10154,You should... floss.,michael,3
10155,I know...,dwight,2
10156,[exhales] Well then... I am glad you're ok.,michael,8
10158,"Dwight, can I talk to you for a second?",michael,9
10159,"[in Michael's office] Wow, this is tough.",michael,7

10165,Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job!,michael,16
10166,Gahh!,dwight,1
10167,"And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.",michael,32
10168,I can't believe this news.  That--- wow.,dwight,8
10169,I know.  I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it... because you've always been so loyal to me.  You've been my most trusted ally.,michael,29
10170,You said that?,dwight,3
10171,"Yep, I did.  I did.  But I think... you should do it.",michael,14

10179,[muttering] Can't you?  That's so nice.,michael,7
10180,Well... I guess we should go tell the troops.,michael,9
10181,"Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike. [Dwight exhales, Michael looks at the camera] Ok let's do it.",dwight,16
10182,"Hey, hi, hello.  Everybody, I have some good news, and I have some bad news.  I... am being replaced, as your leader, by Dwight.",michael,26

10186,Thank you Angela.,dwight,3
10188,"Because, Dwight... never lies.",michael,4
10190,Because that's all it takes.,michael,5
10191,"Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty?",michael,14
10192,"Thank you Michael.  I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black!  With ferocity!",dwight,32
10194,"Oh, I'll be fine.",michael,4
10196,"No, no, I don't, but---",michael,5
10198,I... won't.   I won't.,michael,6
10199,"I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken.  If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager.",pam,19
10202,Yes.,dwight,1
10204,I,dwight,1
10206,"Oh please, don't be naive.  But you can be in charge of the women.",dwight,15
10208,I'm sorry what are you whispering about?,jim,7
10210,I'm trying---,jim,2
10212,Oh.,jim,1
10214,"What? [Karen's player shoots Jim's player, 'You killed Jim Halpert' appears on the screen, Karen giggles]",jim,16
10215,Wow. Psychopath.  [Karen grins widely at Jim],jim,8
10216,What?,pam,1
10218,Please go back to your desk.,pam,6
10220,"Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work.  But I'm gonna keep the clothes.  I mean, it'll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren't pajamas.",pam,35
10221,"Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring.",michael,15
10222,[smiling] No thank you.,dwight,4
10223,"It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it.",michael,8
10224,No thanks.,dwight,2
10225,What?,michael,1
10226,Not my style.,dwight,3
10227,But you said you liked it.  You've always admired it.,michael,11
10228,"Well that was before.  I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage.  Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate.",dwight,27
10229,[Michael finally breaks] Take it back.,michael,6
10230,[confused] No.,dwight,2
10231,That's my car.,michael,3
10232,What did you---,dwight,3
10233,THAT'S MY CAR.,michael,3
10234,Yes.,dwight,1
10235,"I know, Dwight.  I know.  I know.  I know.",michael,12
10236,You know what?,dwight,3
10237,Jan called me about your little meeting!,michael,7
10238,No!,dwight,1
10239,"I know, what you did.  I made the whole thing up, Dwight.",michael,13
10240,I think the Sebring's cool.  It's cool.  The Seabring's cool.  It has a cassette and it has a CD.,dwight,22
10241,"Oh do you?  Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?!  How dare you, Dwight?",michael,17
10242,[Dwight gets on his knees and puts his face down on the ground] Don't fire me.  Please.,dwight,18
10243,Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?!,michael,15
10244,[terrified] I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS!,dwight,6
10245,Not.  Good.  Enough!,michael,5
10246,[sobbing] I'll do anything!  Anything!  I'll do your laundry for a month!  For a year!,dwight,18
10247,I have a laundry machine!,michael,5
10248,"I'm sorry!  I'll do anything, I swear. [squeaking, crying]",dwight,10
10249,I don't know if I can trust you anymore.,michael,9
10250,"You can't.  You can't.  But I promise I'll never betray you again.  What can I do, Michael.  What can I do?  [Michael exhales]  What can I do?  [Dwight has his face to the ground but his butt raised high in the air] What can I do?  What can I do?",dwight,58
10251,"You can get up.  Get up. [Dwight gets up with spit hanging from his lips] And you can hug it out, bitch.  [Dwight and Michael have a firm embrace]",michael,31
10252,"Hug it out, bitch.  That is what men say to each other, after a fight.  They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go.  And walk away.  And they're done.  Not a good idea to say that to a woman however.  I have found.  It doesn't translate.",michael,57
10253,"[leaving his desk for the day, pretends pull the pen out of a pretend grenade, and tosses it to Karen]",jim,20
10256,Okay. [Jan leaves Michael's office; Dwight enters],michael,7
10257,Hey. [shuts door] Is everything okay?,dwight,6
10258,"It is not your business, Dwight.",michael,6
10259,"If the branch is in trouble, there are things you can do.",dwight,12
10260,"What do you know about management, Dwight?",michael,7
10261,I know that we need to cut costs.  We could fire Meredith. That's a big cost.,dwight,17
10262,I'm not firing anyone.,michael,4
10263,"Creed might be living here, we could charge him rent.",dwight,10
10264,... What?,michael,2
10266,"Okay. Here we go. Everybody, you know what? It dawned on me we were all in there watching a movie together before we were so rudely interrupted, Let's get back in there. [no takers] Come on. Movie Monday! Come on, Stanley let's go.",michael,43
10268,Ryan?,michael,1
10270,"Okay, well, we had scheduled this time to watch a movie together, so I guess I will just go play some online Scrabble.",michael,23
10271,[looks to Angela],dwight,3
10273,"The Schrutes are a very loyal breed. But I also have Mannheim blood from my German grandmother. And the Mannheims knew when to cut and run. No sense going down with a losing regime. But the Schrute blood... It's amazing that when these two bloods mix, the whole thing didn't explode.",dwight,51
10274,"So, she sleeps with him, but she is still in love with the head surgeon, um, the McDreamy guy, and she starts crying, but the dorky doctor, he's in love with her... [phone rings]",michael,34

10276,Really?,michael,1
10277,Yeah.,pam,1
10278,"I may have a few weeks ago faked a call from Jan in order to get out of a synopsis of, I think it was, Navy: NCIS. Since then, Michael's been suspicious.",pam,32

10284,[nervously] Pretty good.,jim,3
10286,[baffled expression],jim,2
10287,Things are a little bit... different here in Stamford. [shrug] It's not bad.,jim,13
10288,"Hey Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse?",michael,11
10290,"Oh, it's okay, I'm going down.",michael,6
10292,"All right, I'll be right back. [goes down pretend stairs]",michael,10
10293,[laughs uproariously and applauds] Whoo!,dwight,5
10294,[hands Ryan pencil]  There you go.,michael,7
10295,Awesome!,dwight,1
10297,You're welcome.,michael,2
10298,"Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse?",dwight,12
10299,Don't mind if I do.  See you in a minute.  [goes back down pretend stairs and grabs pen from Stanley's desk],michael,23
10300,Okay. [continues to laugh] Whoo!,dwight,5
10301,"There you go, fresh from the warehouse.",michael,7
10302,"Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse?",pam,11
10303,"There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam.",michael,6
10304,But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better.,pam,8
10306,"[breathless] All right.  Okay. [goes back down pretend stairs, crawls on belly to the kitchen for the coffee]",michael,19
10307,I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys.  Gotta keep the troops entertained.,michael,15
10308,[after Michael returns with coffee] With cream and sugar?,pam,9
10309,[sighs] All right.,michael,3
10311,"Oookay.  Let me see if I have his cell.  Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan?  Or does somebody miss me?",michael,26
10313,"Oh, wow.",michael,2
10314,"Attention, everybody.  I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first.  My old boss Ed Truck has died.",michael,28
10316,"Yes, I am.  It's very sad.  Because he was my boss.",michael,13
10318,"That's right, you worked with him.  So did Creed.  Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by.  Cheer me up.",michael,28
10319,So did you hear the news?,michael,6
10320,The news that you just announced?  That Ed died?,pam,10
10321,Yeah.,michael,1
10322,Is there anything I can do?,pam,6
10323,"Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really?  It's... pssssh... .  He was almost 70.  Circle of life.",michael,20
10324,Yeah.,pam,1
10325,[holds out arms to Pam],michael,5
10326,Oh.  Okay.,pam,3
10327,Yeah.  Mmmmmm.,michael,3
10328,[extricating herself] Okay.,pam,3
10332,"Oh yeah, definitely.",jim,3
10333,"[coughing out his words] Suck up!  Josh, did you hear what I said?",andy,14
10336,What's up?,jim,2
10338,Oh.,jim,1
10340,"Mmm, that's where you're wrong.  I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require.  So, I think we should go get some.  Now, please.",jim,41
10342,Yeah.  Must really have you thinkin'.,michael,7
10344,"The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die.  You knew that.",michael,16
10346,What?,michael,1
10347,Really?,dwight,1
10349,Oh my God.,michael,3
10350,That is the way to go.  Instant death.  Very smart.,dwight,12
10352,You're thinking of a chicken.,dwight,5
10354,"That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry.  Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.",michael,30
10355,"[clears throat] So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this...",michael,11
10356,Ed was decapitated.,dwight,3
10357,What are you doing?,michael,4
10358,You said you didn't know how to say it.,dwight,9
10359,I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck.  And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him.  And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.,michael,41
10360,Hey.,dwight,1
10362,"If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice.",dwight,15
10365,"I don't understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn't even work here.",michael,17
10367,"You really don't get it, do you?  You don't understand these people.  That is the last thing that they would want is a day off.",michael,27
10369,[thoughtfully] A statue.,michael,3
10371,Yeah.,michael,1
10373,"Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him.",michael,14
10375,"We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move...",michael,13
10376,"That is not a statue, that is a robot.",dwight,9
10377,I think that is a great way to honor Ed.,michael,10
10378,And how big do you want this robot?,dwight,8
10379,Life-size.,michael,1
10380,"Mm, no.  Better make it two-thirds.  Easier to stop if it turns on us.",dwight,16
10382,"Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan.",michael,22
10384,Mm hm.,michael,2
10386,Oh do you?  You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck.,michael,17
10388,But Ed truck can't because he is---,michael,7
10390,DEAD.,michael,1
10391,Look [holding up sketch] I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us.,dwight,17
10392,That's perfect.,michael,2
10393,"Okay, that is a 'no' on the on the West Side Market.",jim,12
10395,Wow.  Never pegged you for a quitter.,jim,8
10397,Really?,jim,1
10399,Hey.  What are we doing?   What's the game?  I want in.,andy,15
10400,"Oh, there's no game.  We're just trying to get these chips for Karen.",jim,14
10401,Did you check the vending machine?,andy,6
10403,I have no idea.  We went right for the copier.,jim,11
10405,And then we checked the fax machine.,jim,7
10407,Did you check your... butt?,andy,5
10408,"Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was?  If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception.  Probably get on Pam.",michael,28
10410,What?,michael,1
10412,"Well, you know what?  I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it.  He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham!  His cappa is detated from his head!",michael,41
10414,"Well, you know what?  There's something wrong with you.  There is something wrong with everybody in here.  Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!",michael,49
10418,"Okay, fine.  Hurry back.",michael,5
10420,Oh.  I would like a break.,pam,7
10422,Great.,pam,1
10424,"I think so.  I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.",pam,15
10428,"[as Pam returns to conference room] Okay, we can start.  Um...",michael,12
10429,You waited for me?,pam,4
10430,"Yeah.  Pam, you're a member of this family.  So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?",michael,25
10432,"Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else.",michael,10
10434,"[returning ball to Stanley] Oh, yes Stanley.  Come on.  Your turn, you have to go.",michael,17
10436,Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam.,michael,9
10438,"Wow.  If you wanna cry, that's okay.",michael,8
10440,Do you want to talk about it anymore?,michael,8
10443,Wait a second.  That's Weekend at Bernie's. [upset] Do you think that this is a game?,michael,17
10445,"All right, we're starting over.",michael,5
10447,You are not leaving.  No!  We are not done.,michael,11
10449,"Yeah.  Well, you know what?  The guy who had my job has died.  And nobody cares!  And he sat at my desk. [breaking down]",michael,28
10451,How do you know?,michael,4
10453,That that bird was dead?  Did you check its breathing?,michael,11
10455,"Was its heart beating, Toby?  Did you check it?  No, of course you didn't.  You're not a veterinarian.  You don't know ANYTHING! [runs out of conference room crying]",michael,32
10456,Michael! [following Michael downstairs] Michael.   Michael ...,dwight,9
10457,"[seeing bird] Oh, God!",michael,4
10458,[in disgust] Oh...,dwight,3
10459,"Oh my God!  Oh my God, come on ...",michael,10
10460,Poor little fella.,dwight,3
10461,Oh shhhh--oot!,michael,2
10462,He is a goner.,dwight,4
10463,"No, he's not.",michael,3
10464,Yeah.,dwight,1
10465,"No, he's not. [cradling bird next to face]",michael,8
10466,"Michael, get him away from your head!  He is covered in germs and bacteria!",dwight,15
10467,"Well, you can't get diseases from a bird!",michael,8
10469,We don't know if it's dead.,michael,6
10471,You want me to flush him?,dwight,6
10472,Attention everybody.  This will only take a second of your time.  Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.,michael,33
10474,"Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith.  But that is what you do when things die.  You honor them.  Toby killed this bird.  And now we are going to honor it.",michael,35
10476,"No, no, no!  That's enough!  You know what?  This bird is dead.  He died alone.  The least you can do is be there for him now. [to Dwight] Find a box for him.",michael,38
10478,Nice!,jim,1
10480,Sounded good.,jim,2
10483,"It's okay.  It's okay. [pats Kelly on shoulder] Shh... yes, I know, I know. It's been a tough day, but it's good to let it show.",michael,27
10485,[trying to shove bird into a can] Argh... gah!,dwight,9
10486,What are... What are you doing?,michael,6
10487,"What?  No, this is about the right size.",dwight,9
10488,"No, God, no it's not!  What is the matter with you?  Is that the beak!?",michael,17
10489,"I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm.  We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon.  My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. [pause] It would have fit if he had given me another minute.",dwight,39
10490,I need a box.  I need a box.  A small box... not too confining.,dwight,16
10491,Is it for the bird?,pam,5
10492,Yeah.,dwight,1
10493,I have it covered. [hands Dwight a decorated box],pam,9
10494,"Oh, thank you.",dwight,3
10495,If you wanna do something for the funeral...,pam,8
10496,"Yes, please.",dwight,2
10497,Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.,pam,9
10498,Excellent.,dwight,1
10499,Do you have it with you?,pam,6
10500,Always. [runs off],dwight,3
10501,Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral?  You never can tell what your day here is  gonna turn into.,pam,28
10503,Where'd I find what?,jim,4
10504,"I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.",jim,32
10505,Glad you could all make it.,michael,6
10507,"Dwight, do you have the box?",michael,6
10508,"Actually, I have it.",pam,4
10509,You made this?  Wow. [impressed] That's... that's very nice.,michael,10
10511,I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay.,pam,11
10512,Yes.,michael,1
10513,"What do we know about this bird?  You might think, 'Not much.  It's just a bird.'  But we do know some things.  We know it was a local bird.  Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.",pam,51
10515,"And we know how he died.  Flying into the glass doors.  But you know what?  I don't think he was being stupid.  I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.",pam,49
10516,He's not a songbird.,dwight,4
10517,Shhh.,michael,1
10518,"An impression, then.  Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone.  Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much.  He will not be forgotten.",pam,55
10520,[begins playing recorder],dwight,3
10521,[singing] Just smile for me and let the day begin.  You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ...,pam,26

10525,Umm... sure.,jim,2
10527,[chuckles] He's so cute.,jim,4
10529,"That's okay. [Hannah shows pic of husband naked with baby] Oh, no, it's not. I'm sorry, is that your husband in the tub with him?",jim,25
10531,Sounds good.,jim,2
10533,"Oh, wow. He...",michael,3
10535,Does his family know?,michael,4
10537,But I'm the first in the office?,michael,7
10539,"Okay, yes, sure, I will do that...",michael,7
10541,"...'Cause I'm the first to to find out. Nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them. Well, good. How are you holding up? Want me to come over? [Jan hangs up]",michael,34
10542,"Ed Truck died. And it blows. They say that with grief, time makes it worse, which is bad for me because I found out before anybody so I've had more time to be sad.",michael,34
10543,"Attention, everyone. As you know, Ed Truck is dead. If you have any contact information on Rolodex files or in Microsoft Outlook, remove it now. Also, if you have any photographs, Pam will make her shredder available during lunch. That is all.",dwight,42
10544,"Remembering the dead doesn't help anybody. The way to best honor them is to figure out what killed them and prevent that thing from killing anyone ever again. In this case, some sort of steel exoskeleton to protect the neck, or else a device that allows the head to live separately from the body. I'm working on both.",dwight,58
10545,"I would like you all to clear your schedules this afternoon, because I am telling corporate to send in a grief counselor. We need to find out what is blocking you. And that way, we'll be able to honor Ed the way he deserves to be honored. May he rest in peace.",michael,52
10547,"What was that, Kevin?",michael,4
10549,"No, you said something, didn't you?",michael,6
10551,You think that's funny.,michael,4
10553,You are disgusting.,michael,3
10554,"Michael, no need to call corporate. We are supposed to use Toby. He's trained as a grief counselor.",dwight,18
10555,"No, that can't be right.",michael,5
10557,"Well, then I guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world, doesn't it?",michael,17
10559,Hi.,pam,1
10561,"Well, I will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone I've never met.",pam,16
10563,"Closer to the epicenter, I guess.",pam,6
10567,"You're ruining it, already. They should not be given the choice.",michael,11
10574,"Wow. Wow. No. No. You are the most heartless, soulless person I've ever met.",michael,14
10581,"I found an exercise in Toby's binder that he managed to miss, that involves screening the part of you that says, 'I don't wanna do that. I don't wanna talk about that. That is too private.' Here's how it works. I'm going to throw you this ball.",michael,47
10584,Really?,pam,1

10588,"Yeah, I'd love to see them. Oh, and tell them I say, 'Congratulations.'",pam,13

10617,"Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?",michael,29
10619,I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had sex. Is that what you want to hear?,michael,26
10620,"Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base.",michael,20
10622,Hi.,pam,1
10624,"Oh, I don't know if I'm...",pam,6
10626,"It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five.",pam,20
10627,So you excited?,dwight,3
10629,Very excited?,dwight,2
10631,Extremely excited? ... Just very?  That's cool.,dwight,8
10633,"I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?",dwight,40
10635,"When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.",dwight,21

10639,Is it?,jim,2
10641,"No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair.",jim,19
10643,So I guess I can't get up.,jim,7

10652,I'm acting my heart out here.,andy,6
10654,"Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped.",andy,10
10656,Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is.,pam,26
10657,"Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me.",michael,56
10658,"[looks at long pretzel line] Oh, shhh... Come on.",michael,9

10692,I don't care 'bout anything but you... what ever happened to those guys?,andy,13
10693,Michael.,pam,1
10694,"No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind.",michael,15
10695,Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.,pam,12
10696,I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel.,michael,20
10697,"Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel.",pam,21
10698,"Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.",michael,18
10699,"You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today.",pam,13
10700,"Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back.",michael,10
10701,It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.,dwight,22
10703,You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?,dwight,47
10705,Come on!,dwight,2
10707,Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.,michael,11
10709,Thank God.,michael,2

10720,What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?,dwight,8
10722,Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide?,dwight,12
10724,Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?,dwight,9
10733,"Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear?",dwight,11
10735,"Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.",dwight,43
10737,Wrestle him to the ground.,dwight,5
10739,Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?,dwight,15
10741,Where are all the animals?,dwight,5
10742,"Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.",dwight,31
10743,"You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.",dwight,38

10747,"Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal?",michael,28
10748,Establish time frames. Keep the phrase 'real dollars' in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.,dwight,36
10750,"Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.",dwight,15
10752,Good.,dwight,1
10754,Right.,dwight,1

10811,What?,pam,1
10812,How many words per minute does the average person type?,jim,10
10813,I type 90.,pam,3

10832,I know!,jim,2
10833,But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.,pam,14
10834,No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?,jim,12
10835,Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box.,pam,15
10836,"No, you're making this up!",jim,5
10837,Would I make that up?,pam,5
10838,"Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.",jim,12
10839,"Oh, yeah, in my fancy new apartment. I have one bedroom, one bathroom, and a closet.",pam,16

10882,Don't you realize the key is inside you? [pretends to pull key out of Ryan's ear],dwight,16

11108,"Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike.",jim,12
11109,"No way, dude. I am not driving home. I have brought an inflatable bed for just such occasions. You're welcome to share it though. It's a roomy twin.",andy,28
11110,Okay.,jim,1
11111,Oh.,jim,1
11113,I'm a drunk driver.,jim,4

11117,"No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right.",jim,17
11119,So good.,jim,2
11121,These are not my shoes. This is just like that show 'Taxi Cab Confessions'.,michael,14
11122,You say one more word; I'm stopping the car.,pam,9
11123,Sorry.,michael,1
11126,How do I explain this to Jan?,michael,7

11132,"Hello, Jan.",michael,2
11134,"Well, I was letting everybody go to the big Diwali party.",michael,11
11136,What is Diwali?,michael,3
11138,"You don't know what Diwali is? Wow, Jan. I'm surprised. It's the Hindu festival of lights. I just assumed you'd be familiar with it. It's the most sacred and honored Hindu holiday in the world. It's like Christmas, Easter, and Halloween---",michael,41
11140,---rolled into one.,michael,3
11142,"I bet you're not even aware that our own Kelly Kapoor, who works in...",michael,14

11160,"Yeah, you should see her naked.",michael,6
11177,Does Michael talk about,dwight,4
11179,He does? What does he say.,dwight,6
11181,"At Cornell, in my fraternity, my house name was 'Hubble' because I was so good at finding a party. I was like a powerful space telescope, so... Freshman year, when my skin was still really bad, they called me El Guapo.",andy,41
11182,"Yeah. Big Tuna, tuna?",andy,4
11183,"Nope, I got eel.",jim,4
11184,[speechless],andy,1
11186,Didn't see that coming.,andy,4
11187,"And perhaps the most important person to Indian culture, Sir Ben Kingsley. Because of him, the British left India, and then he became an actor like Ronald Reagan.",michael,28
11188,Michael?,pam,1
11189,Yeah?,michael,1
11190,Your shirt is buttoned wrong.,pam,5
11191,"So, any questions?",michael,3
11193,Hey.,jim,1
11195,"Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain.",jim,6
11196,"I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. [reading fax] 'Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight.'",jim,59
11197,No![knocks coffee out of Stanley's hand.] You'll thank me later.,dwight,10

11210,What?,michael,1
11212,You're welcome.,michael,2
11214,Am I a small number person or a severance package person?,michael,11
11216,"Oh... [burrys head in hands] Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don't really get it 'cause we're not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up.",michael,29
11218,Well...,michael,1
11220,"Oh, you gotta be... Josh?",michael,5
11222,"Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?",michael,11
11224,Pictures. Memories. [Picks up a framed photo of Stanley's daughter from Stanley's desk] Look at that. They grow up so fast.,michael,21
11225,Hey stranger.,dwight,2
11226,Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please.,michael,8
11227,Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.,dwight,10
11228,"Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can.",michael,17
11229,"When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'",dwight,50
11231,Really? Wow... that's bad.,jim,4

11234,Mmmm.. suck-ah!,andy,2
11235,Are you okay?,pam,3
11236,"Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life.",michael,9
11237,What did Jan want?,pam,4
11238,"Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so...",michael,9
11239,What can't you tell me?,pam,5
11240,"Nothing, Pam.[whispers to himself] What difference does it make?  We'll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.",michael,19
11241,What?!,pam,1
11242,What?,michael,1
11243,You just said that we're gonna be gone...?,pam,8
11244,Do I have any messages?,michael,5
11245,"Michael, what's going on?",pam,4
11246,"Ok, ok...",michael,2
11247,"[facing the whole office] Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down.",michael,20
11249,"You knew about this all along, didn't you?",michael,8
11251,Traitor. You are a traitor.,michael,5
11253,I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst.,michael,9
11257,"[surrounded by clapping coworkers] Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut!",andy,8
11258,"I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.",jim,47
11260,"It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, 'Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.' So, maybe that'll stop now.",pam,26
11265,Darryl. Noble Darryl. [sighs],michael,4
11267,"I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me.",michael,14

11271,Awesome.,michael,1
11272,This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.,michael,25
11273,"All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there. [Looks at  Dwight] Let's go.",michael,49
11274,Yes!,dwight,1
11275,"Oh, good... you're bringing Dwight.",pam,5
11276,Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.,michael,8
11277,What's the plan?,dwight,3
11278,"Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch.",michael,16
11279,Can I drive?,dwight,3
11280,No... way.,michael,2
11281,Shotgun!,dwight,1
11282,No. There's no one else.,michael,5
11283,Still.,dwight,1
11284,"Thank you very much. [hangs up cell phone] Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office.",dwight,25
11285,"Okay, okay. Um...",michael,3
11286,"But, do not worry. I have his home address right [presses cell phone button] here.",dwight,15
11287,Why?,michael,1
11288,Christmas card list.,dwight,3
11289,You sent him cards? You never met him.,michael,8
11290,"But when I do, we'll have something to talk about.",dwight,10
11291,"Hey, do you have a second?",jim,6
11293,"I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?",jim,18
11295,"Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?",jim,8
11297,What does that mean?,jim,4
11317,"Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.",jim,13
11318,"So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up?",dwight,12
11319,I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.,michael,9
11320,"No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice.",dwight,17
11321,All right.,michael,2
11322,"[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work.",dwight,11
11324,Yes? What is the meaning of this?,dwight,7
11325,Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?,michael,17
11326,"Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents.",dwight,13
11327,"Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.",michael,10
11328,"Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business.",dwight,18
11329,"[no longer talking to Dwight as Wallace] Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that.",michael,20
11330,"[as himself] Whoa hey, why not?",dwight,6
11331,"Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?",michael,17
11332,Okay.,dwight,1
11333,Don't touch me this time.,michael,5
11334,"[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work...",dwight,14
11335,"Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?",michael,4
11336,[frightened] Uh!,dwight,2
11338,Wow.,jim,1
11340,Thank you.,jim,2
11342,"No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um...",jim,27
11344,"No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think.",jim,19
11346,Okay.,jim,1
11359,"Ah. [takes a gulp of Gatorade and passes the bottle to Michael] Here, replinish your fluids.",dwight,16
11360,[takes bottle and cleans off cap with his tie],michael,9
11362,He's not here. I don't know where he is.,pam,9
11369,Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?,pam,10
11371,"Sure, uh, Jan... um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton?",pam,13
11373,Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?,pam,8
11375,[referring to Michael's ringing phone] who is it?,dwight,8
11376,The office.,michael,2
11377,Gonna get it?,dwight,3
11378,"No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news.",michael,17
11379,I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.,pam,15
11381,"That's, um... I hadn't thought about it, huh.",pam,8
11383,"Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right?",pam,17
11387,I really don't know.  How you doing with all this?,jim,11
11389,You'd actually move to Scranton?,jim,5
11391,New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York?,jim,29
11394,"[after screaming and throwing papers around in the kitchen] What's up, Josh?",andy,12
11396,"Thanks, man. You, too. Totally.",andy,5
11397,Anything?,michael,1
11398,Nothing. [puts down binoculars],dwight,4
11399,What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under?,michael,12
11400,Then it was an honor to have worked with you.,dwight,10
11401,"[pats Dwight and sighs] All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.",michael,12
11402,My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.,dwight,14
11403,That was hilarious. The foam ...,michael,6
11404,"Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.",dwight,28
11405,"Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good.",michael,7
11406,What were your favorite moments?,dwight,5
11407,"Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one.",michael,12
11408,What about when Jan said the branch was closing?,dwight,9
11409,"God, Dwight!",michael,2
11410,"Well, it doesn't...",dwight,3
11412,"No thanks, guys.",pam,3
11414,Have fun though.,pam,3
11417,Really? Where did you hear that?,pam,6
11423,Okay.,pam,1
11425,Yeah.,pam,1
11427,"Yeah, me too.",pam,3
11428,"Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.",pam,30
11429,"Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.",jim,30
11431,Okay.,jim,1
11433,What are we still doing here? It's over. Let's go home. Get the car.,michael,14
11434,[picks up his beeping cell phone],dwight,6
11435,"Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody's jobs. Nobody likes me anymore!",michael,32
11436,[on the phone] Oh my God!,dwight,6
11437,What?!,michael,1
11438,"Stranford is closed! Michael, we're not closed. Stamford is closed. Stamford is closed.",dwight,13
11439,We did it? We did it.,michael,6
11440,We did it!,dwight,3
11442,Right here! Right here! [pounds his chest against Dwight's],michael,9
11444,"Yeah, baby!",michael,2
11445,In your face!,dwight,3
11446,We did it!,michael,3
11447,"Oh, man.",dwight,2
11448,How did we do it?,michael,5
11449,I don't ... have no idea.,dwight,6
11450,I don't understand.,michael,3
11452,The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.,jim,18

11472,[scoffs] I could beat that on a skateboard.,dwight,8
11474,"Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time.",dwight,12
11475,"Really, Dwight? How fast are you?",pam,6
11476,Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.,dwight,14
11477,Really?,pam,1
11478,I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.,dwight,20

11598,Right.,michael,1
11599,Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.,dwight,12
11600,Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales.,andy,8
11601,"So you'll be reporting to me, then.",dwight,7
11602,"Umm, on the contrary.",andy,4
11603,My title has 'Manager' in it.,dwight,6
11604,And I'm a director.,andy,4
11605,Oh.,dwight,1
11606,Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film?,andy,17
11607,I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them.,dwight,11
11608,Congratulations.,andy,1
11609,"Hey, Toby!",jim,2
11611,"How are you, man?",jim,4
11613,I just wanted to say hi.,jim,6

11621,All right.,jim,2
11623,No problem.,jim,2
11625,[off camera] ...what?,jim,3
11628,[talking to himself] I present the orientation video.,michael,8
11629,We need to talk!,dwight,4
11630,Not now.,michael,2
11631,Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?,dwight,13
11632,I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.,michael,13
11633,Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?,dwight,9
11634,"It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.",michael,21
11635,Ok. Who reports to who?,dwight,5
11636,"I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?",michael,23
11637,And then if I want...,dwight,5
11638,Work it out amongst your selves!,michael,6
11639,I...,dwight,1
11640,"Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company?",michael,14
11641,I...,dwight,1

11648,Really?,jim,1
11650,Great. What's new with you?,jim,5
11652,"Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please [makes drum roll noises], the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!",michael,40
11653,Yoko shack.,michael,2
11656,"Nope, no. Guests only.",michael,4
11658,"Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo.",michael,14
11660,"Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.",michael,8
11662,"No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please. [talks to group] Welcome. Help yourself.",michael,14
11664,"Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation.[talks to group] Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.",michael,30
11665,"Oh, this looks promising.",jim,4
11666,You won't be disappointed.,pam,4
11669,"Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'.",michael,20
11670,"Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.",dwight,8
11671,So check out how we live,michael,6
11673,They call it Scranton.,michael,4
11674,What?,dwight,1
11675,The Electric City. Scranton.,michael,4
11676,What?,dwight,1
11677,The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider.,michael,12
11678,But check that it's covered by your health care provider!,dwight,10
11679,It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.,jim,16
11680,[in video] I am so scared... when people don't label their personal food.,michael,13
11682,"You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,",michael,24
11683,But the little cars go in the compact spot,dwight,9
11685,[on video in background] Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?,michael,16
11686,"Well, so far, I think it is killin'. I thought it would either be an 'A' or an 'A+' but I completely forgot that there's an 'A++'.",michael,27
11688,Terrible. Totally unconvincing.,jim,3
11690,"Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.",jim,11
11692,You feel good?,jim,3
11694,All right.,jim,2
11696,"Hey, buddy. Anything new to report?",andy,6
11697,Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works.,dwight,12
11698,"Sure thing, buddy.",andy,3
11699,"Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin' on the charm.",andy,29
11700,"Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screen saver.",andy,10
11702,Do you like it?,andy,4
11704,Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way.,andy,11
11706,You're welcome.,andy,2
11707,Hey.,pam,1
11708,Hey!,jim,1
11709,What happened to grape soda?,pam,5
11710,Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.,jim,17
11711,Oh. You've changed so much.,pam,5
11712,"Well, I'm evolving, Pam.",jim,4
11713,So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?,pam,24
11714,"Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.",jim,11
11715,"Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever.",pam,6

11719,All right.,michael,2
11720,Don't...,jim,1
11721,Okay.,michael,1
11722,All right. [to Pam] I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.,jim,15
11723,"Yeah. I know, me too.",pam,5
11724,All right!,jim,2
11725,"The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good.",pam,21
11730,What is that? A squid's eye or...,michael,7
11732,How did you...,michael,3
11747,People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences?  A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.,michael,46
11749,Do you have batteries?,dwight,4
11750,Ssshh stupid! Um...,michael,3
11751,[sings drum beat intro to 'What is Love?'],andy,8
11752,That's it!,michael,2
11753,[sings] What is love?,andy,4
11754,"Yes, yes! Okay!",michael,3
11755,"Baby, don't hurt me.",andy,4
11756,"Okay, here we go.",michael,4
11758,Oh!,michael,1
11759,"Baby, don't hurt me!",andy,4

11766,"You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy!",michael,23
11767,"Oh, probably because of all the nose candy.",andy,8
11768,"[laughs hysterically] Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor.",michael,13
11769,"Very funny, Michael!",dwight,3
11770,Okay! Okay!,michael,2
11771,"Really funny, Michael!",dwight,3
11772,"All right, all right, I'm on a roll.",michael,8
11773,Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them.,michael,17
11775,Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would.,michael,14
11777,I understand. We're all friends.,michael,5
11779,"Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.",michael,14
11781,You know what? I'll help. I will...,michael,7
11783,Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this!,michael,7
11784,Do this. Come on. Ready?,dwight,5
11785,Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up.,michael,9
11786,On three. One... two... three.,dwight,5
11787,"Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I'm under this... I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here.",michael,26
11789,We've almost got it. Push it! Push it!,michael,8
11791,I'm right in your crack!,michael,5
11793,Up and over.,michael,3
11795,Up and over.,michael,3
11797,You've got it.,michael,3
11799,"You've got it, you've got it.",michael,6
11801,Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay.,michael,4
11802,"Hey, hey. Easy.",dwight,3
11803,Easy.,michael,1
11805,Don't...,michael,1
11807,What...,michael,1
11809,I don't understand.,michael,3
11811,"Well, we'll squeeze you in.",michael,5
11813,"You can't quit! On the first day. That's [deep voice] heresy, my friend! [regular voice] Okay, let's talk about this. What happened? I mean, what... Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause he's... what?",michael,35
11815,My management style? So... didn't you think 'Lazy Scranton' was funny?,michael,11
11817,"Okay. Well, don't bother quitting because you're fired.",michael,8
11819,"You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!",michael,18
11821,"Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.",michael,19
11822,That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.,dwight,14
11823,"Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.",michael,9
11824,And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice? [whispers] Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.,dwight,27
11825,Dwight may have won the battle. But I will win... the next battle.,andy,13
11828,"Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.",michael,13
11830,No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.,michael,23
11831,"The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it.",michael,44
11832,"Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.",michael,18
11833,What!,dwight,1
11834,Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on!,michael,12
11836,Does he ever.,jim,3
11837,"Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators.",michael,26
11838,YEAH!,dwight,1
11839,Yeah.,michael,1
11841,"Go home, Toby. Just...",michael,4
11843,Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful. [reads note] 'You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!',michael,48
11845,"No. No, no, no. No.  You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh...",michael,28
11848,THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!,michael,6
11857,"See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most. [answers phone] Jell-o!",michael,48
11859,"Hi, Jan!",michael,2
11861,I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.,michael,8
11863,Yes.,michael,1
11865,But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.,michael,16
11867,What?,michael,1
11869,"Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos.",michael,10
11870,"So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two.",michael,19
11871,If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.,dwight,12
11872,"Yeah, it does, actually.",jim,4
11873,So who will be your new Number Three?,dwight,8
11874,Uh... that I have not decided yet.,michael,7
11875,"Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb.",andy,16
11876,"Thank you, Andy. That's... very kind. Thanks.",michael,7
11877,And I have to say your leadership...,dwight,7
11878,Shut it...,michael,2
11879,has brought...,dwight,2
11880,Shut it! That's... [whispers to camera] suck up!,michael,8
11881,"[talking on cellphone] Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?",jim,8
11883,[laughs] What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day?,jim,10
11885,Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... . [sees Pam in rearview mirror] Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?,jim,23
11887,"Ok, thanks.",jim,2
11889,Hey.,jim,1
11890,Hey!,pam,1
11891,I thought you had already... left.,jim,6
11892,Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.,pam,13
11893,Oh... Good.,jim,2
11894,What's up?,pam,2
11895,"Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something.",jim,17
11896,What do you mean?,pam,4
11897,I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh...,jim,16
11898,Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want.,pam,10
11899,O..ok. Um..good.,jim,2
11900,We're friends. We'll always be friends.,pam,6
11901,Right.,jim,1
11902,It's good to have you back.,pam,6
11903,Yeah. Good to be back.,jim,5
11906,"Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon?",andy,17
11907,"Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.",dwight,10
11908,"Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese.",andy,13
11909,Xterra's not even a real word.,dwight,6
11910,"Actually, it is. It's Latin for 'earth.'",andy,7
11911,"Oh, so you drive an X-Earth?",dwight,6
11912,Yeah.,andy,1
11913,That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.,dwight,12
11914,"Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back.",andy,16
11915,Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.,dwight,13
11916,"Oh, speaking of time machines, I just got back from the future and I went to your funeral and, guess what, nobody came.",andy,23
11917,"Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die.",dwight,11
11918,"Oh, that was a really well constructed sentence. You should be an English professor at Cor-not University.",andy,17
11919,Idiot!,dwight,1
11920,"If I were an idiot, I'd be driving a TransAm.",andy,10
11921,"If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.",dwight,16
11922,[coughs word] Idiot!,andy,3
11923,[coughs sentence] You're the idiot!,dwight,5
11924,[coughs sentence] Nice comeback!,andy,4
11925,[coughs sentence] I was making fun of your comeback! That's why it worked. [talks normally to camera] Totally got the best of that interchange.,dwight,24
11926,"And this is, don't tell me, Martin... Ne... Ne...Nack.",michael,9
11927,Nash.,dwight,1
11928,Martin Nash. Okay.,michael,3
11929,"Male, age 37...",dwight,3
11930,Good.,michael,1

11932,What are you talking about?,michael,5
11933,[holds up piece of paper] It wasn't clear on the Google Image search.,dwight,13
11934,"All right, just...",michael,3
11935,"Hey, Kev. How you doing?",jim,5

11958,[Pam nods head] You should say hi. Use her full name.,pam,11
11959,"Thank you for all of this. This is so helpful. You know what? One last question. Um, who is that fine older gentleman in the corner? [points to Creed]",jim,29
11960,"Uh, that is Creed Bratton. He has four toes and he fought in the Civil war.",pam,16
11961,For the North.,jim,3
11962,For both sides. Whoever paid more.,pam,6
11963,Obviously.,jim,1
11964,Yeah.,pam,1

12009,[gets up] I'll do it.,andy,5
12010,"All right. Good. Thank you. [Andy picks a card] Do not look at your card. Now, I've always said that to be a great salesman is to have the ability to connect with people right here [puts hand over heart]. So to be a great salesman is to be a king of hearts. Turn over your card.",michael,57
12011,[turns over card] King of hearts.,andy,6
12012,[starts clapping] Very good Michael. Really good. [Michael shushes Dwight],dwight,10

12050,Just about... yup. Now.,jim,4
12051,"Yes. I have started to see Karen. It's very new, and... not really ready to talk about it openly yet, just because, I think, once the word gets out there, it might affect the way people behave around us or... I dunno. Just, not yet.",jim,45

12080,Why did the convict have to be a black guy? It is such a stereotype. I just wish that Josh had made a more progressive choice. Like a white guy... who went to prison for... polluting a black guy's lake.,michael,40
12082,"In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened.",michael,29
12083,Why would anyone go to jail for that?,pam,8
12084,"Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people.",michael,27

12095,She's... high-maintenance.,jim,2
12096,"Next. How about... [motions toward Angela]. Blondes are more fun. C'mon, trust me on that.",andy,15
12097,"Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.",jim,10
12098,"Okay fine. Um. Pam, the receptionist. Paaam. Should I go for it?",andy,12
12099,...Absolutely you should.,jim,3

12104,"I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on.",dwight,13
12105,"Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison. [Dwight starts to run] No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool!",michael,20
12106,"I am greatly concerned about having a convict in the office. And I do not care if that convict is white, black, Asian, German, or some kind of halfsy. I do not like criminals.",dwight,34
12107,"All... righty, let's get started. What is she into?",andy,9
12108,"I know Pam pretty well. I know the things that she likes, and, just as important, I know the things that she hates. So, one of the things that she likes is pranks. And, the things that she hates...",jim,39
12109,Frisbee-based competitions...,jim,2
12110,Are you kidding?,andy,3
12111,She...,jim,1
12112,I started the main Frisbee golf club at Cornell. Where I went to college. I live to frolf.,andy,18
12113,"Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy. [Andy hums Six Flag ad] Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?",jim,32

12127,"Close your eyes. Picture a convict. What's he wearing? Nothing special, baseball cap on backwards, baggy pants... he says something ordinary like... 'yo, thats shizzle.' Okay. Now slowly open your eyes again. Who are you picturing? A black man? Wrong. That was a white woman. Surprised? Well, shame on you.",michael,50
12129,No. That's not cool. You don't have to tell them.,michael,10
12131,[laughs] That is awesome.,michael,4
12133,What was prison like?,pam,4
12138,"Yeah, some days I never go outside.",pam,7
12139,"Well, we are running a business, so.",michael,7
12142,They have art classes?,pam,4
12146,Kinda sounds like... prison's... better than Dunder-Mifflin.,pam,7
12147,Ah. Well. That's not true.,michael,5
12150,No you would not.,michael,4
12151,This place is not prison. It's... way better than prison.,michael,10
12155,"Pam-a-lama-ding-dong. Listen, you're cute. There is no gettin' around it. So... I don't know if you like country music, but I was thinking maybe one of these days we could drive out to a field, crank up some tunes, smoke a few Macanudos... maybe even toss a disk around.  Utway ooday ooyay inkthay, Ampay?",andy,55
12156,Wow... I--,pam,2
12157,Shh. Think about it. I'll hit you back.,andy,8
12158,Wow. That was... wow.,pam,4
12159,"Okay! Listen up everybody! Um, you guys said that prison was better than this place, and I heard ya, loud and clear, so, I am instituting some changes to make this more like prison. We are going to start with an hour of outdoor time. So let's go!",michael,48
12160,"Michael, it's freezing out.",pam,4
12162,Why don't we... pump some iron? Anyone wanna... pump up?,michael,10
12163,"What is that, like... five pounds?",jim,6

12169,Ah. A ten inch black and white?,michael,7
12171,These people don't realize how lucky they are. This office is the American Dream. And they would rather be in the hole.,michael,22
12172,Oh. Andy. I thought of one last tact you can take with Pam.,jim,13
12173,Yeah.,andy,1
12174,Quick question - do you play the guitar?,jim,8
12175,I play the banjo.,andy,4
12176,"Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?",jim,20
12177,"[singing] You know I can, my man.",andy,7
12178,Yup. That's perfect.,jim,3
12180,Hey.,jim,1
12181,I'm gonna go get my banjo out of my car.,andy,10
12182,Perfect.,jim,1
12184,...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.,jim,28
12186,"...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but...",jim,11
12188,"Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... we'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else.",jim,24
12193,Where... did you learn all of this?,jim,7
12194,Internet.,michael,1
12195,"So, not prison.",jim,3
12196,"And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office.",michael,39
12197,"What'd you do, Prison Mike?",jim,5
12198,I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... president's son. And held him for ransom.,michael,17
12199,"That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.",jim,8
12200,"And I nevah got caught, neither.",michael,6
12201,"Well, you're... in... prison, but, mmhmm.",jim,6
12202,Prison Mike? What was the food like in prison?,pam,9
12203,"Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair.",michael,14
12204,Wow. Prison sounds horrible.,andy,4
12205,"Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks.",michael,7
12206,Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison?,dwight,10
12208,"The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they'd come down, and they'd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!",michael,37
12211,"Wow. Thank you. Um, that must have been hard for you to relive that. Both of you.",pam,17
12213,"Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go. [locks employees in conference room]",michael,21
12214,"Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out.",jim,7
12215,"No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I am out of ideas.",michael,46
12220,"They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt.",michael,28
12222,"Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.",michael,12
12224,"[unlocks door] Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!",michael,32
12225,"Martin went from being a new guy from Stamford... to a convict, to... my friend. Back to a convict. Then to... a kind of a nuisance, actually, to be completely honest. And finally, to... a quitter. And I will not miss him. And that is not because he is black.",michael,50
12226,"[singing] So we've been told, and some choose to believe it, I know they're wrong, wait and see, 'cause one day we'll find it, the ainbowray onnectionkay, the lovers, the dreamers, and meeee...",andy,33
12227,Merry Christmas! [holds up dead goose and puts it on Pam's desk],dwight,12

12229,"Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead.",dwight,8
12230,"Dwight, what uh...",pam,3
12231,I accidentally ran over it. It's a Christmas miracle!,dwight,9
12232,"Well, get it out of here.",pam,6
12233,"Relax, OK. And because this is Christmas, I am going to roast this goose and prepare it with a wild rice dressing. Do we have any cayenne pepper in the kitchen?",dwight,31
12234,Merry Christmas Dwight.,jim,3

12236,Wow. What have we got here?,jim,6

12241,[to Pam] So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.,dwight,17
12243,"No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead.",dwight,8
12244,"Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed.",dwight,28
12245,"He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.",dwight,50
12246,Wow. Win-Win.,jim,2
12247,"Exactly. Thank you, Jim.",dwight,4
12251,"Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas.",dwight,11

12267,Umm... I don't know? Average kind?,michael,6
12269,"Well, that is probably from the test drive.",michael,8

12354,It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.,michael,12

12356,[moves a little] Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?,michael,12
12357,Like what?,pam,2

12359,"Well.. um I, I don't...",pam,5
12360,And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to?,michael,21

12386,Carol?,michael,1
12387,"Oh, look at this. [looks through papers] Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box. [Michael hits repeat to 'Goodbye My Lover' on computer]",dwight,35
12388,Why don't you just buy the whole song?,dwight,8
12389,I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it.,michael,22
12390,"Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem. [Continues to sift through papers] But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie.",dwight,48
12391,[singing] Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. [hits repeat again],michael,10

12472,It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael? [food is thrown at Dwight's face],dwight,27
12473,"I'm already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can't, OK, I'm gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out...",michael,24
12474,No.,andy,1
12475,Who are you calling?,dwight,4
12476,I'm just gonna call her.,michael,5
12477,"Put that away. Put that away. S.O.S. We... I... May day. Haha. Man down over here, [to waitress] we need your help.",andy,22
12479,I think we'll start with a round of noga-sakes. [waitress gives confused look],andy,13
12480,"One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal.",andy,18
12482,That's a great idea.,pam,4
12485,You can have your snack in here.,pam,7
12491,"If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong.",pam,17
12493,"Oh, I just get those at any party supply place.",pam,10
12495,"Oh yeah, your mom would love that.",pam,7
12497,Bye.,pam,1
12499,"Oh, yeah... Maybe.",pam,3
12500,Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there.,dwight,11
12502,"Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though.",dwight,10
12504,"Nah, I don't know... Still think Nakiri's better.",dwight,8
12506,Nothing he's doing is cheering me up.,michael,7
12507,"Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn't do that to him, would you?",andy,22
12509,"Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour. [Cindy laughs and walks away]",michael,22
12510,"You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us. [referring to what chef is doing] Watch, watch, watch, watch. [Onions smoke up] Heh, heh? What did I tell 'ya?",andy,29
12511,You're right. That's good.,michael,4
12512,Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So... you can come by... .,pam,24
12515,"Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael! [waves down Michael with a napkin and whistles to get attention]",dwight,16
12516,This drink... [in audible conversation with Michael],andy,7
12517,I don't know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party.,michael,14
12519,[with conviction] Start the party.,dwight,5
12521,Our party is also starting now [opens door to break room.],pam,11
12524,Good choice. [Kelly drags Ryan to the break room.],pam,9
12531,We have vodka!,pam,3
12537,I got goose bumps.,pam,4
12539,"Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef. [points to chef] Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak. [leans over to neighboring man's plate] I see steak.",michael,37
12541,"Excuse me [tries to take away meat with chopsticks] Ah, un guard. [Fights with chopsticks and laughs] Family style.",michael,19
12542,"No, it's not.",jim,3
12543,"Cindy, Cindy.",andy,2
12544,I don't think... I love it!,michael,6
12545,"I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house. [Cindy laughs] C'mon, do it for Michael. He's had a really long day.",andy,25
12546,[laughing] I don't know what he's doing.,michael,7
12547,This is great.,andy,3
12548,Jim! Jim! What... What's happening?,dwight,5
12549,"Oh, [points to Cindy] she's asleep.",jim,6
12550,Oh... Narcolepsy.,dwight,2
12551,Probably.,jim,1
12552,Now open your eyes and describe it to me.,andy,9
12554,"Oh my gosh, now she's up.",dwight,6
12555,"And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it.",jim,16
12556,"Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood. [Cindy looks confused. Woman next to Dwight is disgusted] Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers.",dwight,59
12557,"Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing.",jim,27
12564,What?,pam,1
12582,"[referring to waitresses] They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding!",andy,15
12583,You know what we should do?,michael,6
12584,What?,andy,1
12585,We should invite them to the Christmas party.,michael,8
12586,"Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy.",andy,20
12587,"Oh, you are such mench my friend. [They stand up and do fist bump and explosion]",michael,16
12588,"OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend. [Guys walk in with two different waitresses from Benihana's]",michael,22
12589,"I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too.",jim,8
12590,The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike.,michael,13
12592,"Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, it's yours.",michael,12
12594,Oh. [She whispers in his ear. Michael starts to laugh] That's what she said.,michael,14
12595,Hello? I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend.,michael,10
12596,My new girlfriend.,andy,3
12599,"[whispers] The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame.",michael,19
12601,"Oh, party in the break room! Let's go, let's go! Thank God! Let's go to the break room.",michael,18
12605,Shhh... Shut it! C'mon! Party.,michael,5
12606,"Hey! It's Angela! [Angela slams door shut, but not before Kevin sneaks out] Hey!",dwight,14
12607,We're going to ...,michael,4
12609,"I just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world. People who own houses and people who own condos. [turns to reach for pretzel while Second Cindy turns other direction] And... my question to you [points and pulls away other waitress] is do you agree?",michael,49
12611,Do you agree about what? [laughs] Wow. You're  lucky you're so darn cute.,michael,14
12613,What're you talking about?,michael,4
12615,All right [high fives Kevin],jim,5
12617,No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything. [cheers from other party],dwight,12
12620,No... way! Yeah!,dwight,3
12622,Oh.,dwight,1
12624,Walkie-talkies.,dwight,1
12625,Can I talk to you a second?,pam,7
12626,Yes!,dwight,1
12628,[holds up rice krispie shaped like a star] In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.,pam,14
12631,"Yeah, but we don't have a power cord.",pam,8
12633,Mmm. Hmm.,pam,2
12635,We'll go tell everyone.,pam,4
12638,Your hands.,andy,2
12640,I'll use my hands on it.,andy,6
12643,"When you know, you just know.",michael,6
12645,Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable.,michael,9
12647,It's... it's one of those two. [points at both],michael,9
12650,"Yeah... well, it's been hard, they're wearing the exact same uniform. And I've been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike.",michael,23
12651,I honestly don't see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesn't love his wife just because he's not sure what she looks like?,michael,35
12652,"Hey. Where's my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I don't know where she is. 'Cause I'm drunk, I can't even find her.",michael,27
12654,"Haha, I do! I just haven't hugged you in awhile [marks Cindy's arm with a black marker]",michael,17
12656,"Oh, good. That felt good. Let's go. Party.",michael,8
12658,"[into walkie-talkie] Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy?",dwight,9
12661,"What a horrible, horrible movie that was.",jim,7
12663,Thank you.,jim,2
12666,"Hey, hey, you. How are ya?",michael,6
12668,"No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and...",michael,13
12670,Where do you wanna go?,michael,5
12672,"I... you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica.",michael,32
12674,You want help? OK... Merry Christmas.,michael,6
12676,"[singing] Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed...",dwight,19
12677,That waitress was the one.,michael,5
12678,No. She wasn't.,jim,3
12679,How can you be sure?,michael,5
12680,"Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately [looks a watch] three hours ago.",jim,24
12681,Don't make fun... You're making fun of me.,michael,8
12682,Sorry.,jim,1
12683,"I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm.",michael,12
12684,You what?,jim,2
12685,"I, I put a mark on her arm. [Both are laughing] So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike!",michael,31
12686,Yeah.,jim,1
12687,"Oh, why do I feel like crap?",michael,7
12688,You just had a rebound.,jim,5
12689,I had rebound? Yeah.,michael,4
12690,"Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.",jim,31
12691,"I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn't score and I'm not sure who's actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesn't matter. It's all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o.",michael,44
12693,"[on phone] Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There's this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won't be disappointed. Umm, It's all-inclusive...",michael,37
12697,[singing along] pum pum pum pum pum pum pum,dwight,9
12698,Bye Pam.,dwight,2
12699,Night.,pam,1
12700,"[to Pam] Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.",jim,43
12701,We should get him a bus ticket. [types on computer] To make his trip easier.,pam,15
12702,"Oh no, that would be great.",jim,6
12703,It costs seventy five dollars.,pam,5
12704,"Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?",jim,9
12705,Ohh... [laughs],pam,2
12706,[Cell phone beeps] What the? [Reading text message] 'You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone.' Destroy phone? [Dwight throws phone off of the roof and walks away],dwight,28
12707,"William Randolph Shakespeare once wrote in one of his plays, and I'm paraphrasing here, 'Love doth be poison.' Brilliant. And a lot of people don't give Shakespeare enough credit. They think it was somebody else. A-holes.",michael,36
12733,"No, no, no, no. You know what, I better hold off. I wanna make sure I don't dial Carol before I get drunk.",michael,23
12734,"So, really, you're just calling her?",jim,6
12735,Yeah. You know what? I am. I'm gonna call her. That's a good idea.,michael,14
12736,[from across the table] Where's Michael going? Michael? Is he sick? Is he choking?,dwight,14
12737,"[on [phone] No, I don't think I'm asking too much. I think it's only fair that you tell me exactly what I did wrong. Okay. Uh huh. Well that... yeah. Uh huh. All right. Well, could you tell me something that I did",michael,43
12769,"Oh, honey, here's Stanley.",michael,4
12771,"He is also in an interracial relationship, so, you know, if you have any problems, you can always call him.",michael,20
12773,"Sounds good. Okay, let's go.",michael,5
12774,"All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... [to Dwight] what is this?",jim,30
12775,Tape recorder.,dwight,2
12776,For what?,jim,2
12777,For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.,dwight,20
12778,"OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?",jim,9
12780,"Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing?",jim,7
12781,What?,dwight,1
12782,You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.,jim,14
12783,I'm not.,dwight,2
12784,"Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife!",jim,26
12785,I do not have a knife!,dwight,6
12786,"No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?!",jim,22
12787,[leans into tape recorder] Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar!,dwight,14
12788,[picks up tape recorder and speaks into it] Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.,jim,16
12789,Give me it. I am not.,dwight,6
12791,"Jim Carrey did not just walk in, OK.",dwight,8
12793,"Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.",jim,13
12794,You can't see... You can't see my stomach.,dwight,8
12795,I am now chopping off Phyllis' head with a chainsaw! ... Rin-in-in-in-in-in!,andy,12
12796,"Hey, mon!",michael,2
12797,Hey. You have a bunch of messages and... [sees Michael shaking head with beads in hair] that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.,pam,48
12798,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax.",michael,9
12799,OK.,pam,1
12800,"Just relax, OK? I'll get to all of it later.",michael,10
12801,It's kind of serious.,pam,4
12802,Aren't you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me.,michael,13
12803,How was Jamaica?,pam,3
12804,It was,michael,2
12806,"Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too.",michael,12
12808,"OK, well payroll is in charge of all that.",michael,9
12810,"Well, I am just getting settled in. So, I'm gonna...",michael,10
12812,You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers... mon.,michael,11
12813,You want to talk about it?,jim,6
12816,"Feelin' hot, hot, hot! [playing conch shell] Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! That's all I know so far, but I'm gonna keep practicing.",michael,30
12817,That's good. [Michael continues to play conch shell],pam,8
12818,"You know, I had never been out of the country before now?",michael,12
12819,Huh.,pam,1
12820,"Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time.",michael,19
12821,It's kind of an impoverished country.,pam,6
12822,"Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three.",michael,23
12823,"But you can't today, we're doing inventory.",pam,7
12824,Inventory's at the end of December.,michael,6
12825,"We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed.",pam,9
12826,I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it.,michael,10
12827,"Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don't make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans?",michael,26
12828,"Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it.",michael,32
12830,The Jamaicans don't have a word for 'impossible.',michael,8
12831,"Yep, it's English, it's 'impossible.'",jim,5
12833,"How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. That's all you need.",michael,25
12835,Oh my God. Is that Jan? [points to same monitor],pam,10
12837,On the left.,pam,3
12839,"No, no, no. No, that's a German woman named Urkel Grue.",michael,11
12841,[on phone] Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica.,michael,10
12843,"Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay.",michael,17
12845,"Well I'm looking at a photo, right now. And I'm telling 'ya, could be in Maxim.",michael,16
12847,Oh no?,michael,2
12849,"OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it?",michael,14
12851,Check it again. Hit refresh.,michael,5
12853,"OK, wait a second. I sent it to you at... [reading computer screen] Packer@DunderMifflin.com.",michael,14
12855,Darryl?! Hey. Hi. Where's Darryl?,michael,5
12857,"OK, Hey, man, how's it going?",michael,6
12859,"That's great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me?",michael,12
12861,"OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not 'packaging.' Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?",michael,22
12863,"OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it.",michael,26
12865,And you sent that out to everyone?,michael,7
12867,Yikes.,jim,1
12869,Fantastic.,jim,1
12870,Boring. Call me if she rolls over.,andy,7
12871,Hey.,pam,1
12872,Hey.,jim,1
12873,You OK?,pam,2
12874,Yeah.,jim,1
12875,You sure?,pam,2
12876,"Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.",jim,12
12877,Oh. You want to talk about it?,pam,7
12878,Really?,jim,1
12879,I have a special assignment for you.,michael,7
12880,Who's the target?,dwight,3
12881,"A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is 'Jamaican Jan Sun Princess.'",michael,23
12882,What's it of?,dwight,3
12883,Not important.,michael,2
12884,"Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.",dwight,12
12885,"OK, forget it.",michael,3
12886,"OK, I accept it.",dwight,4
12887,"So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.",jim,26
12888,Hmm.,pam,1
12889,"Hmm, what?",jim,2
12890,"How far away does she live now, like ten minutes?",pam,10
12891,"Yeah, I guess.",jim,3
12892,"Honestly, I think you should go easy on her.",pam,9
12893,"No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah.",pam,32
12894,"Hey, thanks a lot.",jim,4
12895,"Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!",pam,31
12896,"Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping? [both start laughing]",jim,19
12898,"Not now, not ever.",michael,4
12900,"Aww, none of your business.",michael,5
12902,"That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops.",michael,29
12904,This is probably the icebreaker you need.,michael,7
12906,"I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you? Skeevy little perv.",michael,13
12908,"No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?",michael,32
12910,OK.,michael,1
12915,"[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it's Jan on the phone for you.",pam,18
12916,"Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I'm not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat.",michael,45
12917,"He'll call you back. OK, great.",pam,6
12918,She bought it? [Pam nods] OK. OK.,michael,7

12923,"Oh. God. No, no, no, no, no.",michael,7
12925,All right. [continued clapping and cheering for Michael],michael,8
12927,"Hello. Hi. Attention everyone. Um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rating picture of me and a woman---",michael,24
12929,"No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe...",michael,7
12930,Urkel Grue.,jim,2
12931,"My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right?",michael,23
12932,"Feelin'... feelin' hot, hot, hot! [plays conch shell]",michael,8
12933,Hey.,pam,1
12934,Hey.,michael,1
12935,What are you doing out here?,pam,6

12941,"Uh, I think you dropped this [hands over piece of paper]",jim,11
12943,Definitely.,jim,1
12944,I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that [referring to large picture of Michael and Jan in Jamaica on the wall] be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.,dwight,36
12945,There are copies in the bathroom?,michael,6
12946,There were. A lot of them.,dwight,6
12947,All right.,michael,2

13224,I really 'Schruted' it.,andy,4
13225,What?,michael,1
13226,"Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?",andy,45

13499,"[trying to look in Phyllis's desk, she slams the drawer shut] I don't trust you, Phyllis!",andy,16
13501,Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.,michael,17
13503,Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?,michael,15

13509,No. I don't want to do any of that.,michael,9
13510,Duh. Which is why I was just joking about doing that.,andy,11
13511,"No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You're going to drive me crazy.",michael,13
13513,Yeah.,pam,1
13514,Sure? Okay.,andy,2

13518,What's up?,michael,2
13519,Same old.,dwight,2

13521,"Oh my God, she told you?",dwight,6
13522,"Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.",michael,30
13523,Accepted.,dwight,1
13524,How's this place treating you?,michael,5

13560,It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.,michael,51

13874,[in video of Michael as a kid] I hate you!,michael,10

13945,Yeah.,pam,1
13947,It's okay.,pam,2

14002,You're... You're welcome.,michael,3
14003,They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say that's crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad.,michael,43

14022,"Will they throw their hats, you think?",michael,7
14024,"A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.",michael,24
14026,"Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for that: 'May your hats fly as high as your dreams.' ... That was a pretty good line.",michael,37
14028,"I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz! [pokes Ryan] Whoa, hey!",michael,16

14063,I'm sorry what did you say? So wierd...,jim,8
14064,What? What's so wierd?,dwight,4

14074,No... no. One crisis at a time.,dwight,7
14075,"If a vampire bat was in the U.S., it would make sense for it to come to a 'sylvania.' Like PENN-sylvania. Now that doesn't mean that Jim is going to become a vampire. Only that he carries the vampiric germ.",dwight,40
14078,"Oh! No, you should go.",pam,5
14080,"Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.",michael,39

14105,"Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?",michael,9

14111,Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW!,dwight,9
14114,"Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.",michael,28
14116,David will always beat Goliath.,michael,5
14118,"Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, sex predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school?",michael,32
14120,"Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita.

14195,What are you reading?,jim,4
14196,"Oh, umm, ever since I started here, I've kept a diary of all my sales.",michael,15
14197,"Oh, that could be interesting.",jim,5
14198,"No, it's just mileage mostly, but there's one chapter that I call wisdoms. I'm going to read you a series of statements, and I want you to tell me, on a scale of one to ten, how smart they are.",michael,40

14200,"Don't do what I say, say what I do.",michael,9
14201,Five.,jim,1
14202,Just getting warmed up. Mistakes are just successes that you mess up.,michael,12

14262,"And now, the chains.",michael,4
14263,"A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that's why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. It's um, it's really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school.",michael,48
14264,"MAGIC MAGIC Magic Magic magic magic... And now, Michael the Magic, will attempt to escape from extreme bondage. [Kevin giggles] Can he do it? I don't see how he can.",michael,30

14271,AHHHH!,michael,1
14273,Yes.,michael,1

14293,Yeah.,jim,1
14294,"Why don't I wanna go? Didn't expect to need a reason, so let me think here. Um. I don't know any of these people. It's an obligation. I don't like talking paper in my free time, or in my work time. And, did I use the word pointless?",jim,48
14295,Thanks for inviting me along.,dwight,5

15045,"Ok, you know what?  I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.  [to warehouse guys]  Sorry, he is very lame.  [takes book from Toby] Um, let's see.

15097,"I--- I---  Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that...",michael,26
15098,It's really hard to demonstrate depression.  Their safety training had visuals.,pam,12
15099,"Yeah... you are... ah, so right.  They had visual aids.  And all we had were the facts.  You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity.

15911,"Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.",jim,31
15913,All right. Hope nobody's on a diet.,michael,7
15916,"You're welcome. You're welcome, you're welcome. OK. So, let's dish.",michael,10
15917,What do you want to dish about?,pam,7
15918,"Anything you guys want. This is your time. [everyone is silent or continues to eat, Michael exhales] Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it 'shmear?' Like the cream cheese.",michael,31
15919,"OK. New topic. Kelly, how are things with Ryan?",pam,9
15921,"What, um... what do you think of role-play?",michael,8
15923,"Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.",michael,7
15925,I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.,michael,8
15928,"Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with.",pam,9
15929,Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.,michael,30
15930,"Oh, my God.",pam,3
15931,[groans] And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.,michael,12
15933,"No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.",michael,20
15934,"Michael, you need to get out of this.",pam,8
15935,"No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing.",michael,9
15936,"No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad. [Karen nods and Michael looks like he's about to start crying]",pam,22
15937,"No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK. [sniffing] You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan? [sighs]",michael,20
15938,Read the pros first.,pam,4
15939,"OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.",michael,13
15942,Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts: not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I'm unhappy when I'm with her. Flat-chested.,michael,22
15943,What was the last one?,pam,5
15944,She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.,michael,5
15946,I'm unhappy when I'm with her.,michael,6
15947,Michael... you shouldn't be with someone who doesn't make you happy.,pam,11
15948,I'm happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.,michael,15
15950,"Yeah, that's smart.",michael,3
15951,Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other.,pam,11
15952,That sounds good too. I don't know who's right. I just don't - I don't know. I don't know.,michael,19
15954,I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.,michael,13
15956,"Wow, I cannot believe this yogurt has no calories.",michael,9
15957,No one said it has no calories.,pam,7
15958,"Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you. [Kelly sprints inside Victoria's Secret] Come on. Get in here.",michael,49
15959,"Let's face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.",michael,48
15967,"Mm. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.",michael,46
15970,I'm kind of in-between boyfriends right now. So I don't need anything sexy. But I do need some new hand towels. I figure I can cut up this robe.,pam,29
15972,"Oh. Oh, no. [inhales sharply]  It's Jan. What do I do?",michael,12
15974,Don't answer it.,pam,3
15975,"OK, it stopped.",michael,3
15978,[snickers at Pam's sketch] That is pretty cool.,jim,8
15980,"Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will...",michael,13
15981,"Here, uh... Meredith? Why don't you put your hazards on.",pam,10
15982,"Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let's see. [takes off his coat and tosses it aside] There we go! [Pam brings over the jack and lug wrench] Good. Yes, we have the... all right. [tries the use the jack to loosen the lug nuts]",michael,45
15983,I think I've got it.,pam,5
15984,Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan?,michael,9
15985,"I don't think we really need that, Michael.",pam,8
15986,Uh... you know what? I'm going to... you take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic... detail.,michael,17
15987,"You know, I changed a tire today. All by myself. This bathrobe's already coming in handy. [Meredith honking] Coming!",pam,19
15988,Think we'll find him?,andy,4
15989,"Yeah, I do. 'Cause justice never rests.",dwight,7
15990,[pulls a candy bar from his coat pocket] Halvsies?,andy,9
15991,No. Wholesies. [snatches the candy bar],dwight,6
15992,"Listen, man, I really appreciate you letting me shadow you today. I feel like I learned a lot.",andy,18
15993,Natch. [bites off a lot of candy bar],dwight,8
15994,"Yep. If you don't mind, I think I'll hang some of these posters around my neighborhood. Schools, post office, et cetera.",andy,21
15995,"You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass. [coughs]",dwight,13
15996,"OK, I am really going to do this.",michael,8
15997,"Good luck, Michael.",pam,3
15998,"You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let's do this. Let's do it. [sighs]",michael,22
16000,I love you guys.  Now I'm getting her voicemail.,michael,10
16001,Don't leave a -,pam,4
16004,Thank you.,michael,2
16006,Abso-fruit-ly.,michael,1
16008,No... No...,michael,2
16010,Yeah.,michael,1
16012,"Maybe some Italian. [voice on phone] '... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -' [Jan takes the phone away from her ear] Chinese? [voice on phone] 'who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy.'",michael,43
16015,"[phone rings] Dunder-Mifflin paper/sex predator hotline, this is Dwight Schrute.",dwight,10
16016,"Hey, Dwight. It's Jim.",jim,4
16017,"Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy.",dwight,7
16018,"No, you're not. I'm looking right at you.",jim,8
16019,Ugh. I'm hanging up.,dwight,4
16020,Don't. [quietly] I have information about the sex predator.,jim,9
16021,You have information about the sex predator?,dwight,7
16022,I saw him two minutes ago.,jim,6
16023,Where?,dwight,1
16024,"In the women's bathroom, above the sink.",jim,7
16025,"[hangs up and runs to the women's bathroom] Anti-flashing task force! Above the sink. Above the sink. Hmm. [sees himself in the mirror with two black marks on the mirror making a mustache, removes his glasses and figures it out] PAM!",dwight,41
16027,Love it.,michael,2
16029,"Uh, yes, I am.",michael,4
16031,"Uh, yeah, it's okay. Its just, I don't think the cartoons are very funny.",michael,14
16033,"The a cartoon that goes with each article.  This one says Mel Karmazin?  I don't, I don't know. I guess I get it.",michael,25
16035,We should really start recycling.,michael,5
16042,"Hey good lookin', what ya got cookin'?",andy,7
16043,"I got nothing cooking, it's cooked.  It's borscht and its served cold.",dwight,13
16044,"Hey listen, I'm sure everyone's already told you but, your presentation out there, was pretty inspiring stuff. Must be nice being a woman around here, knowing they have a protector in you.",andy,32
16045,"If you are trying to kiss my ass, I would not suggest it.  Believe me, you do not want to kiss this ass.",dwight,24
16046,"Borscht, according to Dwight it's best served cold.  You know what else is best served cold?  Yeah, gazpacho.  You see what I'm doing?  I am establishing a mutual love of cold soups.  This is the first step in my plan to win Dwight's trust.",andy,49
16047,I should make you my vichyssoise.,andy,6
16048,I will never be your vichyssoise.,dwight,6
16049,"Orgasms, why can women have them? Yep?",michael,7
16050,"No. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think this is the place to do this.",jim,16
16051,"Sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be a woman.  I have a full-length mirror in my bathroom, and before I get dressed I will tuck myself between my legs just to see.  And, um, it's uncomfortable.  So maybe I do understand.",michael,47
16053,"Lets go, fall out, let's go.  Move, move, move, move, move.",dwight,12
16054,I got shotgun.  Damn it.,michael,6
16056,Look at that! Come on! Free underwear!,michael,7
16057,"It is totally inappropriate, but on the other hand...",pam,9
16058,"Hey, Pam, how bout something like that for you.  Could sort of cover up any imperfections in the mid section.  Just show off the twins a little bit.",michael,30
16059,That's pretty cool.,jim,3
16060,You can make people believe anything.  Today I made Dwight believe I like cold soups.  Why?  I don't know.  I don't have to know.  That's what makes me so dangerous.,andy,35
16061,Idiot.,michael,1
16063,Ughh... Blech.,michael,2
16064,"OK, where does it hurt?",dwight,5
16065,Just... all over. I don't want to do anything... I'm dying...,michael,11
16066,"No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.",dwight,17
16067,Right there. [Michael points to computer screen.],michael,7
16068,[reading from screen] 'Abdomen. Menses.',dwight,5
16069,Maybe.,michael,1
16070,The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it.',dwight,9
16071,Not it. I don't have eggs.,michael,6
16072,"About 40 times a year, Michael gets really sick, but has no symptoms. Dwight is always gravely concerned.",pam,18
16073,"Oh, is it possible you ate food that contained animal waste?",dwight,11
16074,That's possible.,michael,2
16075,Michael?,pam,1
16076,Uh-huh?,michael,1
16077,David Wallace is on line one.,pam,6
16078,The CFO? Ohh...,michael,3
16079,"OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK.",michael,7
16080,"To what do I owe this great honor, David Wallace?",michael,10
16082,And Gromit. [David sighs] Jan? Is Jan there?,michael,8
16084,"Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan's heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes...",michael,30
16086,...you just gots to get your freak on.,michael,8
16088,Yeah.,michael,1
16090,Hmmm.,michael,1
16092,Really?,michael,1
16094,Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say.,michael,9
16096,May God guide you in your quest.,michael,7
16098,"OK, everybody have their towels and swim suits? We have about an hour and half.  I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the partay bus.",michael,34
16100,"Oscar, you brought your Speedo, I assume?",michael,7
16102,"Well, you can't swim in leather pants. [laughs] I'm just yankin' your chain.  Not literally.",michael,16
16104,"Oh, you know what? Uh, you're not going.",michael,8
16106,"Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here.",michael,13
16107,I want today to be a beautiful memory... that the staff and I share after I have passed on to New York. And if Toby is a part of it... then it'll suck.,michael,33
16109,"Oh, great. I forgot mine and I'm wearing a two piece.",pam,11
16111,Thanks Toby.,pam,2
16112,"Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you",michael,10
16113,I thought we were just having fun at the beach.,pam,10
16114,"We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.",michael,45
16115,What happens to a company if somebody takes their boss away? I will answer your question with a question. It's like what happens to a chicken when you take its head away. It dies. Unless you find a new head. I need to see which one of these people have the skills to be a chicken head.,michael,57
16116,You want me to write down people's indefinable qualities?,pam,9
16117,"I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?",michael,25
16118,"I have the most boring job in the office, so... why wouldn't I have the most boring job on beach day?",pam,21
16119,This way to the partay bus.,michael,6
16122,"Everybody, may I have you attention please? Today, we are not just spending a day at the beach.",michael,18
16124,"If you don't like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.",michael,15
16126,"Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus.  Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities.  Funtivities!  And there is a special secret prize for the winner!",michael,33
16127,Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach.,dwight,12
16128,"Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off.",michael,9
16129,I hope there will be management parables.,dwight,7
16130,"Well, [whispering] Hey Pam, did you get that down?",michael,9
16131,Like what?,pam,2
16132,Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't...,michael,11
16133,"Well... no, I don't... exactly... what?",pam,6
16134,Well write it down before you forget it. That's... You've just been drawing pictures. [sighs] Rrrr. I can't stay mad at you.,michael,22
16135,Here we are ladies and gentlemen. Everybody ready? Last one down is a rotten egg. [Gets off bus] Watch out for snakes!,michael,22
16139,"Just words. Inspiring words. [under breath] Not a contender. [out loud] For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.",michael,45
16140,Yes!,dwight,1
16141,Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.,michael,8
16142,"Jim Halpert. Pros: smart, cool, good-looking. Remind you of anybody you know? Cons: not a hard worker. I can spend all day on a project, and he will finish the same project in a half an hour. So that should tell you something.",michael,43
16143,I choose Michael!,dwight,3
16144,I'm not playing.,michael,3
16145,"OK, temp.",dwight,2
16146,"Dwight is an obvious candidate for my job. He has the best sales record in the office. He loves the work. He is, however, an idiot.",michael,26
16147,We are going to choose team names. Dwight?,michael,8
16148,We will be called Gryffindor.,dwight,5
16149,Really? Not Slytherin?,jim,3
16150,"Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim.",dwight,6
16151,"I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort.",jim,7
16152,He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldn't do that.,dwight,5
16153,"[starts chanting] Vol-de-mort, Vol-de-mort ...[Kevin and Karen follow] Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!",jim,11
16154,"OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that.",dwight,8
16155,"Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok... Stanley, your team name?",michael,9
16157,Then I will name your team the Red team.,michael,9
16159,I am also considering Stanley because of all the good that black people have done. For America.,michael,17
16160,We will be team U.S.A.,andy,5
16161,"Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic.",michael,11
16162,Andy Bernard. Pros: He's classy. He gets me. He went to Cornell. I trust him. Cons: I don't really trust him.,michael,21
16163,It is time for the great spoon and egg race. This one is with a little twist.,michael,17
16165,"Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go! [contestants start walking]",michael,46
16168,"Phyllis is out. Yes! [to Kelly] Follow my voice. Follow my voice. Yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. Right this way. Looking good. [Cheers]",andy,25
16170,Don't worry. You're not...,andy,4
16172,No where near the big rock.,andy,6
16174,"What're you doing? No! See, now we're disqualified.",andy,8
16175,I am okay if I lose every single contest today. Honestly. Because I see these contests as an opportunity for me to demonstrate what a good sport I am. Mallard! [throws a stone],andy,33
16176,"[to Karen] Woah, stop, stop, stop. There's a hole. Step over the hole.",jim,13
16178,"Yup. [Karen takes a big step] Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.",jim,14
16179,[to Ryan] Come on!  Come on! Andale! Arriba! Arriba!,dwight,10
16181,What are you saying?,dwight,4
16183,"OK, I apologize for yelling at you.",dwight,7
16185,I am trying to bring team spirit.,dwight,7
16186,"[to Karen] Woah, stop, another hole. Take a big step. [Karen steps into lake] Yes!",jim,15
16188,"There's nothing better than a beautiful day at the beach, filled with sun, surf, and uh... diligent note-taking. [holds up notes]",pam,21
16189,[off screen] Pam...you're missing things. [shakes off hand and starts writing in notebook],michael,13

16191,"[begins to clap] Great job everyone, that was fantastic. [Michael sighs]",andy,11
16192,"Okay Pam, I have another little project for you.",michael,9
16193,Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?,pam,13
16194,"Smart as a whip! Yes! [holds up hot dog packages] These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.",michael,45
16195,When's the contest?,pam,3
16196,Like umm...[looks at watch] ten minutes?,michael,6
16197,How am I supposed to... get...,pam,6
16198,Thanks a bunch.,michael,3
16199,A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success.,michael,11
16202,"No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?",michael,10
16204,It's very good for you. [overlapping talk from all at table],dwight,11
16205,"Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Let's just... OK, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!",michael,31

16214,The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright?,michael,34
16215,You're leaving?,dwight,2
16216,I didn't want to tell anyway. I didn't want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.,michael,34
16217,[slams fist onto table] I am so hungry! [starts eating hot dog real fast],andy,14
16219,[points at Stanley] Word. [Stanley starts eating hot dog] There we go. Let's see it.,michael,15

16223,One came up.,andy,3
16224,"13 hot dogs, everybody!",michael,4
16225,Damn it!,dwight,2
16227,Sabotage.,dwight,1
16229,No. I was saying that before. Not now.  Now I am saying sabotage. The ancient Dutch art of screwing up your own team.,dwight,24
16231,"If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me.",dwight,12
16232,It's very simple. There are only three rules. You must not touch the ground. You must not step outside of the ring. And you must always wear the safety mittens.,michael,30
16234,Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's alright.  It's alright. Here we go.,michael,17
16236,"Aaaaaand, go!",michael,2

16248,Excellent!,michael,1
16249,Gryffindor! Gryffindor!,dwight,2
16250,I didn't win. But the only reason I didn't win is because I recently learned that it's better to work thing out with words.,andy,24
16251,That's not why you lost.,dwight,5
16252,Yeah it is. I totally could have kicked your butt so bad.,andy,12
16253,"Yeah, right.",dwight,2
16254,"Yeah, right, c'mon! C'mon! [Dwight and Andy wrestle]",andy,8

16260,"Angela, it's pretty simple! Look at what I'm doing and go tell somebody about it!",andy,15
16262,Angela!,andy,1
16264,"I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don't really know how to compare those units.",pam,31

16290,But I'm not kidding.  I really want to do it.,pam,11
16291,"Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up.",michael,21
16292,Nope.,jim,1
16293,Ji.. why not? C'mon.,michael,4
16294,"Oh, 'cause I don't want my feet to get burned.",jim,10
16295,You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.,michael,12
16296,That's harsh.,jim,2
16297,Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today.,michael,10
16298,"[lying in water, car lights light up his location] Hello?  Who's there?  My name is Andrew Bernard, I was with a group called Dunder Mifflin.  Hello?",andy,29
16300,Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.,michael,14
16301,"And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.",jim,23
16302,"Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. 'kay. [clears throat, breathes noisily] The mind has to wrap around the foot. [exhales] Okay.",michael,19
16303,Do you want us to count to three?,pam,8
16304,"Yes. Count to three, please.",michael,5
16306,"Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.",michael,15
16308,Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three?,michael,12
16310,Okay.,michael,1
16312,No! It's okay. I will do this Michael.,dwight,8
16313,"Don't, don't.",michael,2
16314,[walking on coals] I will walk and stand on these coals until you award me the position of regional manager!,dwight,20
16316,"[standing still, on the coals] GIVE ME THE JOB!  GIVE ME THE JOB!",dwight,14
16317,I'm not going to give it to you.,michael,8

16320,"Michael, do something!",pam,3
16321,"Aggggh, that stings!",dwight,3
16322,"Being the boss is also about image.  I've never looked like that. That was gross. I just, I don't see the connection between a firewalk and management. Worst seventy-five bucks I ever spent. You know what, if I had to pick my replacement based on today, it would be Mr. 'Outside Hire.'",michael,53
16326,God! He's a comedian.,michael,4
16328,Who's Amanda Bynes?,michael,3
16330,"Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope.  So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got.",michael,49
16331,"Hey, I know what you're looking for, but um, I got to be honest, I really don't think I should be considered as your replacement.",jim,25
16332,You are being too modest.,michael,5
16333,"Michael, on Thursday I'm going to drive down and interview with David for the open position in New York.",jim,19
16334,"Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us.",michael,22
16335,"The Aristocrats. A man and his wife and his children go into the offices of a talent agency. And the talent agent says, 'Describe your act.' And the man says something really, really raunchy and the talent representative says, 'What do you call yourselves?' And the man says, 'The Aristocrats!'",dwight,50
16336,"[breathes deeply and runs across coals] Oooh, uh hah, ooh! Wha-hoo! Ahhhh...",pam,12
16337,[finishes story] I mean truly repulsive acts.,dwight,7
16338,"That is a very, very funny story.",michael,7
16340,"Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background.",michael,15
16342,WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA!,michael,1
16343,Nice!,andy,1
16344,So we have about an hour and a half. I suggest that you all go potty now and then we will be congregating on the party bus. Fun on wheels. Only way to travel. Besides a monorail.,michael,37
16346,"No. No, no, no. No guests today. Classic gang only. Just us good friends, and Karen and Andy.",michael,18
16347,"Sometimes Michael gets nostalgic and he talks about the classic gang. That's Michael, me, Jim, Dwight, Angela, Kevin, Oscar, Stanley, Phyllis, Creed, Meredith, Kelly and Ryan. We're a regular Ocean's Eleven.",pam,31
16348,"Jim, David Wallace is calling for you.",pam,7
16349,"Oh, okay. Hello. Hey, David. Sure.",jim,6
16350,"Pam, you broke up with your boyfriend and then kept working together. How did that work out?",michael,17
16351,You remember you fired Roy for attacking Jim and I don't talk to him anymore really.,pam,16
16352,Acrimonious.,michael,1
16353,This way to the party bus. Good.,michael,7
16355,It's a bus that takes you to a party. Here we go.,michael,12
16357,"Here we go. Come on. Okay, everybody here?",michael,8
16359,"Then, Mr. Driver, we are off like a herd of turtles! Johnny Carson. [Meredith runs to catch up to bus with her large drink cup]",michael,25
16360,"Seat belts fastened, folks. Safety first. Hey what is all this?",dwight,11
16361,Nothing.,michael,1
16362,"If I guess, will you tell me?",dwight,7
16363,No.,michael,1
16364,Please?,dwight,1
16365,No!,michael,1
16366,Is that a sumo suit?,dwight,5

16370,Please tell me. I've been so good...,dwight,7
16371,You are really annoying me. If you don't knock it off...,michael,11
16372,Please.,dwight,1
16373,...I'm never gonna tell you anything ever again. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!,michael,14
16374,Please.,dwight,1
16376,No. We're only 10 minutes from the lake.,michael,8
16378,"Yes, I am choosing my apprentice. Which is why I have modeled all my games after Survivor.",michael,17
16379,Any questions?,michael,2
16380,Just one.,jim,2
16381,Yup.,michael,1
16382,The torches are lit.,jim,4
16383,"Yes, for dramatic affect.",michael,4
16384,"No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That's a hazard.",jim,8
16385,"Very good, Jim. Pam, please note that Jim is very astute. All right, are we ready?",michael,16
16386,Are you not gonna put out the torches?,jim,8
16387,Set!,michael,1
16388,Okay.,jim,1
16389,Go!,michael,1
16391,"It is an honor just to be considered for Michael's job. Honestly. And if I win it, then I will be ordering a pretty sizeable Most Improved Player plaque to put over the hole I punched in the wall.",andy,39
16392,"[sighs] Okay. Pam, who came out best in the race, in your opinion?",michael,13
16393,"Um, Karen left her blindfold on the longest but she also threw her egg at Jim.",pam,16
16394,Because he wasn't following the rules.,michael,6
16395,I think they were just having fun.,pam,7
16396,"But they didn't complete their task, Pam! If people can't carry an egg in a spoon, blindfolded, then what does that tell you about how they will be able to manage a sales report, or conduct a business call?",michael,39
16397,It tells me nothing.,pam,4
16398,Exactly. Are you sure you're doing that right? Taking an awfully long time.,michael,13
16399,There's 800 of them!,pam,4
16400,"Okay, all right.",michael,3
16401,It's very important that you all try to eat as many hotdogs as you can...,michael,15

16405,"No mustard! No mustard! Just... eat it. Eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it will slide down your gullet more easily.",michael,24
16407,"No, no, no, no, not that--- just... come on, you guys, let's do it! I'm serious. Who's got the hungry?",michael,20
16408,I do!,dwight,2
16409,Who's got the hungry?,michael,4
16410,I do!,dwight,2
16411,"Come on, Ryan...",michael,3
16412,Let's go.,dwight,2
16413,"Ryan, I want to see you with a hot dog in your mouth. Right now.",michael,15
16414,Karen and I are having our own contest to see who can eat the most normal amount of tuna salad in an unspecified but very cofortable amount of time. I don't know what to tell you. Right now? Dead heat.,jim,40

16434,Thought I'd catch a show.,michael,5
16436,"Naaah. You know what? Since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.",michael,17
16438,"Um, how many people are you interviewing?",michael,7
16440,"Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?",michael,22
16442,Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?,michael,15
16444,"Ah, great. No further questions.",michael,5
16446,Okay.,michael,1
16448,And I'm really looking forward to working with you.,michael,9
16449,"I got it made in the shade. I know this company. The other branch managers are total morons. [on cell phone] Hey, Pam yeah, I forgot what day the interview was and I drove to New York accidentially. I'll be like three hours late.",michael,44
16451,"Hey, Kev.",jim,2
16453,Thank you.,jim,2

16470,"Thanks, Pam.",jim,2
16472,[knock on door] Yeah.,michael,4
16473,You wanted to see me?,dwight,5
16474,"Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute.",michael,21
16475,"But that's my name. [opens letter and reads] Dwight, congratuations a-wipe.  Don't screw the pooch. [begins to cry]  Thank you.",dwight,22
16476,Okay. Uh...,michael,2

16493,Why so you can do it?,michael,6
16495,Whoops.,jim,1
16496,"No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?  Convoys are really fun.  Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...",michael,37
16497,Hmmm.,jim,1
16499,Moon each other.,michael,3
16500,"Ah, we're gonna go tonight, but we're gonna see you there tomorrow morning, right?",jim,14

16530,"There they are, the Accounting Department. I shall miss your humility and your promptly printed checks.",michael,16

16534,"No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.",michael,30
16539,"Yes, I...",michael,2
16542,I have to buy another place.,michael,6
16545,"I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid.  Sold in record time.",michael,27

16564,Eighty thousand dollars a year.,dwight,5

16655,Thanks.,jim,1
16656,"I'm happy for him.  I hope he gets the job.  I really just want him to be happy.  And I know that sounds cliche.  And I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche...  Maybe I'm being cliche.  I don't care.  Cause I am what I am. [thinks] That's Popeye.",pam,56
16657,I am going to begin this process with a simple test of intelligence and mental dexterity.  What is the best color?,dwight,22
16658,"White, because it contains all other colors.",andy,7
16659,Wrong.  Black.  It is the most dominant.  How do you make a table?,dwight,16
16660,"You make a chair, but you don't sit on it.",andy,10

16662,"The capital of Maine is Montpelier, Vermont, which is near Ithaca, New York, where I went to Cornell.",andy,18
16663,"Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Don't wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.",dwight,24

16665,"You're not off to a very good start, Bernard.",dwight,9
16666,"I agree. But in another way, I am off to a very good start, wouldn't you say?",andy,17

16717,My first order of business: make Andrew Bernard my number two.,dwight,11
16718,My first order of business: accept.,andy,6
16719,As if you had a choice. [scoffs] Duh. [scoffs] Opportunity of a lifetime. [spits chew into Michael's World's Best Boss mug],dwight,21
16720,"Three months ago, I was nowhere.  I was just a Cornell grad, in anger management.  Look where I am now.  Not bad. [washing out Michael's mug]",andy,29
16721,"Hey!  Hunter!  Wha's up my brutha?  This is Hunter, secretary extraordinaire.",michael,14
16723,Jan in yet?,michael,3
16725,"Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?",michael,12
16727,"Just say, 'I want to squeeze them.'  It's code.  She'll know what it means.",michael,16
16729,"Oh, and Hunter?  Could you tell her, [Michael shakes his head and makes the 'motorboat' noise] 'Brbrbrbrbr!' also?",michael,19
16730,You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.  Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.,dwight,21
16731,Thank you.,pam,2
16732,"I had to make Andy my number two.  It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand.  I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.",dwight,24
16733,Really?,pam,1
16734,"Well, in a sense.  Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.",dwight,17
16735,You will be your own assistant.,pam,6
16736,"Correct, I need someone I can trust.  But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you.  Just stripped of its pomp and frills.",dwight,29
16737,"Okay.  So... you would be the Regional Manager,",pam,9
16738,"Mmmmmm, let's call it Secret Assistant",dwight,6
16739,Mm-hmm.,pam,1
16740,Do you accept?,dwight,3
16741,"Absolutely, I do.",pam,3
16742,"I learned from Jim, if Dwight ever asks you to accept something secret... you reply, 'Absolutely, I do.'",pam,18
16743,"[knocks on door] Hello, hello!",michael,5
16745,Good to see you.  Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.,michael,15
16747,Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?  I work too hard.  I care too much.  And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.,michael,31
16749,"Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.",michael,6
16751,Thank you.,michael,2
16755,Then who do you think will get the job?,pam,9
16761,"Listen up!  Come to the center of the room, please.  This... [holds up paper that resemles a sheet sized dollar bill with Dwight's face in the middle] is a Schrute Buck.  When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck.  One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch.",dwight,58
16762,[raises hand] What is the cash value of a Schrute Buck?,pam,11
16763,"Excellent question, Pam.  1/100th of a cent.",dwight,8
16765,Just... zip your lid!  Another announcement.  Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness.  No longer.  No more meetings!,dwight,36
16767,"Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.",dwight,24
16769,"Yes!  Michael is gone.  There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is 'me.'  Conference room!  Ten seconds!  All of you!",dwight,29
16770,I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned.  And I wish Jim were here.,pam,17
16772,"I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin.  I was thinking we could name the company something like, 'Paper Great.  Where great paper is our passion.  We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!'  I don't know, could be good.  Or, uh, 'Super Duper Paper.  It's super duper.'  I don't know, something like that.",michael,58
16774,Okay.,michael,1
16776,Thank you.,michael,2
16778,It is always a treat when,michael,6
16780,"Yes.  And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her. [laughs] Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals.",michael,28
16782,"I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it?",michael,9
16784,Listen up.  Let's start... from the ground,dwight,8
16786,Trees!  And where do trees grow?,dwight,7
16790,Very good!  You have earned one Schrute Buck.,dwight,9
16792,Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!,dwight,8
16794,We--- Don't you wanna earn Schrute Bucks?,dwight,7
16796,What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?,dwight,9
16798,Okay---,dwight,1
16799,That's it!,andy,2
16800,What---,dwight,1
16801,"Class is canceled, everybody out!",andy,5
16802,"No wait, what are you doing?!",dwight,6
16803,I'm punishing them.,andy,3
16804,"No, no, no, wait!  Class is not canceled.",dwight,9
16806,HEY!  COME ON!  Let's listen to Dwight's presentation! [Dwight winks at Pam],pam,14
16808,Zip your lid!,dwight,3
16817,Hey.,michael,1
16819,Pretty good.,michael,2
16821,Could have gone better I guess.,michael,6
16823,Cool.  Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.,michael,11
16825,"Daaah, let's just run away together.  Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would... be fine.  We'd have fun.",michael,40
16827,I can't tell you.,michael,4
16836,"Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan---",michael,4
16843,Hey!,michael,1
16845,No--- We're all unstable.,michael,4
16847,"David, I did not tell her.",michael,6
16848,"It's like staring into my soul, when I look at this wall.",andy,12
16849,"It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black. [laughs]",dwight,10
16850,This is gonna look so awesome!,andy,6
16851,"It's so intimidating!  Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously.  Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!",dwight,24
16852,[laughs] Totally!,andy,2
16858,"So, I am gonna... give her a ride home.  Let me know about the job.",michael,16
16860,"Good, I'm glad we're on the same page.  I have a lot of ideas for new directions.",michael,18
16862,"You know what?  That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job.  That's not being a good boyfriend.  So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.  Do you accept my withdrawal?",michael,41
16864,"Good.  Very good.  I'm glad we are finally on the same page.  Still have my job in Scranton, though.",michael,22
16866,Good.  That's all I ever wanted.  These two. [points at Jim and Karen] Either one of them... excellent candidates.,michael,21
16868,Yeah.  Kinda feel bad for her though.,jim,8
16870,"Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really don't have to stay, if you don't want.",jim,23
16872,Okay.,jim,1
16874,Sure.,jim,1
16876,Thank you.,jim,2
16879,"I know.  I know, I'm sorry about that.  That was terrible.",michael,13
16881,"Well, it's... [Jan starts crying, high pitched whining] No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK.",michael,15
16883,[whispers] I don't know.  [normal volume] Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo.  I think I could back out of the sale. [Jan exhales] Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.,michael,39
16885,"[in the office, imitating the terminator] I'll be baaaaack!  And I am baaaack!",michael,14
16886,How'd it go?,pam,3
16887,"No.  No, Pam.  I'm baaaaaack!  For gooood!  Kevin Nealon.",michael,13
16889,To intimidate my subordinates.,dwight,4
16890,That's stupid.,michael,2
16891,It was Andy's idea.,dwight,4
16892,"You shouldn't have taken it.  Bad management!  Good thing I'm baaaaaack.  [laughs] Ryan, coffee.",michael,17
16894,"No, it's for me, bimbo.  Kids.",michael,7
16895,"So I'm back.  And I am never, ever going to leave.  I am going nowhere.  This place... is like... the hospital where I was born, my house, my old age home, and my... graveyard... for my bones.",michael,40
16896,Did... Karen get the job?,pam,5
16897,[to everyone] Back to work. [to Ryan] Still waitin' on that coffee.,michael,12
16898,"Pam, hello.",dwight,2
16899,"Dwight, hello.",pam,2
16900,"I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.  You served the office with great dignity. [Pam salutes Dwight, Dwight returns the salute]",dwight,34
16903,I should leave. [pretends to get up] [they laugh],jim,9
16905,Thanks.,jim,1
16907,"I'm sorry, wait, so is the question 'How'd I get to be so awesome?' [laughs] Because, I don't have an answer for you. [laughs]",jim,24
16909,"Yes, absolutely.",jim,2
16911,"Oh, no, absolutely.",jim,3
16913,[hands David his papers] There you go.,jim,7
16915,"[not thinking clearly because of Pam's note] What's that? Oh, uh, great.  You know?  I just um, I really appreciate the buildings, and uh, the people, and um, there's just a [sic] energy... New York has, uh...  Not to mention, they have places that are open past eight.  [David laughs] So that's a... bonus.",jim,58
16917,[thinks] The friendships.,jim,3
16919,[flashback to Beach Games] How are your feet?,jim,8
16920,Medium rare.  Thanks. [they laugh],pam,6
16921,The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.,jim,16
16922,I know.,pam,2
16923,"And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back.",jim,16
16924,"Well, I wish you would.",pam,5
16925,"[phone rings, Pam answers] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.  Just one moment, I'll transfer you.",pam,16
16927,"Pam.  [to camera] Sorry. [to Pam] Um, are you free for dinner tonight?",jim,14
16928,Yes.,pam,1
16929,All right.  Then... it's a date.,jim,7
16930,"[to camera, tearing up, smiling] I'm sorry, what was the question?",pam,11
16939,"Well, I don't know what it's gonna be called, but... my point is, the future of this company is now.  And the future... is me.",michael,26
16943,Heart is.  That makes a lot more sense.  You think they'd help each other out like that at corporate? [Oscar shrugs] I think not!,michael,26
16945,Mmm-hmm. [nods],pam,2
16947,"Yeah, well, you know, whatever happens. [Kelly puts her hand on Pam's shoulder] Oh.",pam,14
16949,"Oh, I know.  We talked about it and he told me.",pam,12
16951,Okay.,pam,1
16952,Kelly made me realize something.  She and I have... nothing in common.  And I need more friends.,pam,19

16983,It all happened so fast.,pam,5

16995,What?,jim,1
16996,Where?,dwight,1
16997,"It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could... And she is going to be OK.",michael,36

17003,Did you see who did it?,andy,6
17004,No need we can just check the security tapes.,dwight,9

17012,It was an accident.,michael,4
17013,Was she talkin' back?,dwight,4
17014,No.,michael,1
17015,Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?,dwight,21

17038,So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back.,michael,15
17040,"Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.",michael,8

17050,"Hey monkey, what's up?",dwight,4
17052,Sure.,dwight,1

17062,No.,michael,1
17064,"No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.",michael,51
17065,"Oh good, so we don't have to work.",jim,8
17066,"OK, we're leaving for the hospital at 1.",pam,8

17083,"Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!",michael,7
17084,"Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me... No, don't sue me. That is the opposite of the point that I'm trying to make.",michael,50
17085,Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh... She looks like an angel.,michael,18
17087,"No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault.",michael,12
17088,I think she's awake.,jim,4

17111,"Oh, OK... Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.",michael,33
17113,Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.,michael,16
17115,"Well, just shhhh... just just...",michael,5

17119,Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.,michael,10
17120,Michael! Michael!,pam,2

17142,"Michael, Angela's cat died.",pam,4
17143,Sprinkles?,michael,1
17145,"[sighs] Oh, sh... I'm sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then... Sprinkles! God, that's 3 things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.",michael,54
17146,"Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not superstitious, but... I'm... I am a little-stitious.",michael,31
17147,Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground?,michael,9

17162,"I do not respect her, but I will go.",dwight,9
17163,"Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.",michael,14
17165,Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.,michael,12

17185,"OK, 1 Sikh, and...",michael,4
17186,"As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical.",dwight,48
17187,Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.,dwight,10

17207,Mm-hmm.,dwight,1
17208,"I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?",michael,17
17209,"No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something.",dwight,8
17210,This place is so cursed.,michael,5
17211,"Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw.",dwight,31
17212,"[walks out into the office] I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.",michael,58
17213,"Six of one, really.",jim,4
17215,"Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus' dad?",michael,17
17218,"Michael Scott's Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton, Meredith Palmer memorial, celebrity rabies awareness, fun run race for the cure, this is Pam.",pam,19
17219,Pro-Am.,michael,1
17220,Pro-Am race for the... They hung up.,pam,7
17223,"Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?",michael,7
17225,"Come on man, gotta step it up! It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.",michael,19
17226,Isn't that your money?,andy,4
17227,"That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, how's the rabies quilt coming?",michael,12
17229,"Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.",michael,10
17231,Yes.,michael,1
17233,OK. [walks away],michael,3
17235,"Alright, alright.",michael,2
17237,Shhh...,michael,1
17239,I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.,michael,14
17241,"OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... And I was a peasant.",michael,54
17243,"Well, you're going to have to run, or you're going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore.",michael,23
17244,"[in bathroom] I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So... I take precautions. [tapes a cotton ball to each nipple]",andy,42
17245,"Hey Angela. Hey, um... I'm sorry about your cat. [Angela starts to cry]",andy,13
17248,What's wrong?,pam,2
17250,Hmm...,pam,1
17252,Ah.,pam,1
17254,"Angela, I'm sorry.",pam,3
17256,I'm more of a dog person.,pam,6
17258,So what's your strategy for this race?,jim,7
17259,Well I'm gonna start fast.,pam,5
17260,Mm-hmm.,jim,1
17261,Then I'm gonna run fast in the middle.,pam,8
17262,What?,jim,1
17263,Then I'm gonna end fast.,pam,5
17264,Why won't more people do that? [laughs],jim,7
17265,Cause they're just stupid.,pam,4
17266,[looks at camera] What?,jim,4
17267,"[Pam and Jim watch video of their kiss on the tv] Oh, ah... No that's not... I mean that wasn't, ah...",jim,21
17268,Yeah... That was um...,pam,4
17269,"I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything.",jim,40
17270,"Yeah, I gave him a ride home because...",pam,8
17271,Right!,jim,1
17272,... We're dating.,pam,3
17273,Wow! There it is.,jim,4
17274,"Ah, yeah. We haven't told anybody, but it's going really great. [looks at Jim] Right?",pam,15
17275,It is going really great.,jim,5
17276,[Angela runs into Dwight] Oww!,dwight,5
17278,"You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.",dwight,12
17280,[sighs] You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.,dwight,12
17282,"We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um... when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?",michael,31
17283,"Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds?",pam,29
17284,Hmm... That's a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So...,michael,15
17285,"Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.",jim,13
17286,Giant check it is.,pam,4
17287,Yeah.,jim,1
17288,Yep.,michael,1
17289,"Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.",dwight,17
17290,Bat birth control,jim,3
17291,"Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed.",dwight,19
17292,You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going?,michael,23
17293,"Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.",pam,22
17294,Which we are.,jim,3
17295,And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.,pam,11
17296,What about a rabies nurse?,michael,5
17297,I don't think so.,pam,4
17298,"You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.",jim,22
17299,That's possible. Look into that.,michael,5
17300,"Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.",jim,16
17301,Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.,dwight,15
17302,Have you met that kid? He's not going to college.,michael,10
17303,"Michael, 5k means 5 kilometers, not 5 thousand miles. [knocks]",pam,10
17304,Come in.,michael,2
17305,Hey.,pam,1
17306,"Hey, hey, hey",michael,3
17307,Oh my God.,pam,3
17308,What are you doing?,michael,4
17309,You said come in!,pam,4
17310,"No I didn't, just please don't...",michael,6
17311,Oh my God.,pam,3
17312,So I closed the door but the image of his...,pam,10
17313,Baquette.,jim,1
17314,... dangling participle...,pam,3
17315,Eww.,jim,1
17316,... still burned in my eyes.,pam,6
17317,I can imagine.,jim,3
17318,[Michael knocks slowly on door] Come in.,pam,7
17319,May I enter the room?,michael,5
17320,Yes. Or come in.,pam,4
17321,See how I did that. That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.,michael,23
17322,You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?,jim,12
17323,"Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.",michael,12
17324,"On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.",pam,16
17325,European offices are naked all the time.,michael,7
17326,They're so not.,pam,3
17327,Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so...,michael,9
17328,I didn't see where it started but I saw where it ended.,pam,12
17329,[sighs] Gross.,jim,2
17331,Alright.,jim,1
17332,They say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat.,pam,29
17333,"[naked from chest up] Oh, I'm sorry, is this a working office, and not a French beach?",jim,17
17340,"Check that out. [points to Toby] Look at me, I'm Toby, I'm stretching, I know what I'm doing. Why is he even here?",michael,23
17342,"What? Look, no it was not...",pam,6
17346,"No, don't give him... just, did you hear anything I said?",michael,11
17348,"He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse? [Elizabeth walks up in nurse's outfit] This is the reason we're here.",michael,36
17350,"Oh hey, I know you... Elizabeth?",michael,6
17352,"Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.",michael,34
17354,You got it?,michael,3
17355,Mm-hmm.,dwight,1
17356,"OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.",michael,6
17357,"Just remember folks, it's not about winning, it is about finishing.",michael,11
17358,"On your marks, get set...",dwight,5
17359,[pulls Toby's pants down] Beow!,michael,5
17361,On your left!,michael,3
17364,"I am fast! I'm very fast! I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot. [Creed, Stanley, and Oscar get into a cab]",michael,24
17366,"I've walked 2 marathons. Pretty sure I can handle a 5k. Key is drafting, eliminate wind resistance. [running right behind Kevin]",andy,21
17367,Yeah. [laughs] Oh we're in last place.,pam,7
17368,"Oh, would you look at that.",jim,6
17369,Darn it.,pam,2
17371,"No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!",michael,13
17373,Rabies victims... have to live with an irrational hatred of water their entire lives. So... least I could do.,michael,19
17374,"Oh God! My nipples, it's starting.",andy,6
17381,That fettuccine is sitting in my stomach like a rock.,michael,10
17382,"You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race.",dwight,15
17383,"[laughs] Excellent! ...Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?",michael,7
17385,Ooo! An estate sale. Wanna go in?,jim,7
17386,I don't know I'm really committed to winning.,pam,8
17387,"OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured.",jim,22
17388,Mmm... Yes.,pam,2
17389,That's what I thought.,jim,4
17390,Yeah.,pam,1
17391,Right. Let's do some good.,jim,5
17393,"[Burp] Oh God, Oh, alfredo sauce. I'm getting a stitch. [groans]",michael,11
17394,"[runs into the back of Kevin] Ah, God watch the nipples, Kevin.",andy,12
17396,"How ya feeling, better?",dwight,4
17398,Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat.,dwight,13
17400,I am a farmer Angela.,dwight,5
17402,"OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do.",dwight,33
17404,"I... I sang her, her favorite songs.",dwight,7
17406,It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.,dwight,16
17408,Well I'm not responsible for that!,dwight,6
17410,"Hey, Oww! [looks around to onlookers] It's OK.",dwight,8
17412,"It's nothing, I'm robbing her.",dwight,5
17414,It's fine. What?,dwight,3
17416,"I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how.",dwight,22
17418,"I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good.",dwight,19
17420,[runs by] Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit.,michael,9
17421,"Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?",dwight,15
17423,"[holding lamp] You like it? It's kinda designy and cool, it was $8.00.",pam,13
17424,"Oh, and I get to carry it.",jim,7
17430,"[bent over] I am not going to finish. I can't beat rabies. Nobody can beat rabies, rabies has been around for a thousand years. I was a fool to think that I could beat it. [Creed,Stanley, and Oscar pass by in the cab and get out at the finish line]",michael,50
17431,...talk about it.,jim,3
17432,"Yeah probably. Hey, Michael?",pam,4
17433,"What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...",jim,12
17434,"I can't finish. I feel so weak, I just...",michael,9
17435,"Well, you're probably dehydrated.",jim,4
17436,What do you want me to do Jim?,michael,8
17437,Glass of water would be a start.,jim,7
17439,Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.,jim,12
17440,I'm still having a nice day.,pam,6
17441,You are?,jim,2
17442,"Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00.",pam,8
17443,That's a good deal.,michael,4
17444,"And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not going to get it anytime soon. So... you don't really have to think about it too much.",pam,28
17445,"Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.",michael,10
17446,"Yeah, but there's other, better people out there who are helping.",pam,11
17447,"You just don't think I am capable, of making a difference.",michael,11
17448,"I know you Michael, I saw you naked.",pam,8
17449,"You don't, you don't know me. You've just seen my penis. I can make a difference, remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this... GD 5k [gets up groaning, Jim tries to help] No, no!",michael,52
17452,Hey Mer. How ya doing?,michael,5
17454,"It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.",michael,28
17456,"Thanks, I'm not mad at you anymore. [sighs, takes sucker out of his mouth] Wanna share?",michael,16
17458,"I'm not really sick. [Meredith takes a lick and hands back to Michael] Nah, I'm good.",michael,16
17459,Did you ever think of this?  Would a sober person walk in front of a car?,michael,17
17460,Ay-o!,andy,1
17461,"I'm sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?",jim,12
17462,Well...,michael,1
17464,Michael.,pam,1
17467,That's not...,michael,2
17469,"That's not what...no, no, I'm not saying that, that's disgusting.",michael,10
17471,Then... what are you saying?,andy,5
17472,I am saying... that... maybe I was drunk.  Did you ever think of that?,michael,15
17473,Definitely not.,jim,2
17476,Okay.,michael,1
17477,Maybe she hit me.  You ever think of that?  She hit me?  I don't know whose fault it was.  I wasn't exactly looking at the road.,michael,30
17478,"Hey, Toby. [walks past him to Kelly's cubicle]",pam,8
17480,"Kelly, we're going to visit Meredith at lunch.  [Kelly's lying down on floor, head unseen under desk.  She rolls to her side, away from Pam]  Kelly?",pam,29
17485,"You know what, why don't go around the room and say one memory of Meredith.  I'll start.  I liked her jumpers.  They reminded me of Kindergarten.  Jim?",michael,31
17487,"So, how's the view old girl?  [looking out windows]  Oh!  There's a cemetery.  You think that's affiliated with the hospital, or is it a like a separate feature...",andy,32
17488,"Hey! Okay, okay, okay,    You can just close that.",michael,12
17491,"Let's just... Why can't you just forgive... Why, why are you having such a hard time laughing this off?  How do you know that you weren't born with some sort of abnormal pelvis that it was just bound to crack at some point?",michael,44
17493,I'm not going to leave until you forgive me.,michael,9
17495,"[standing for a while, sighs, turns to walk out] Oh, okay.",michael,11
17499,This office is cursed.  [sighs]  And we need to do something about it.,michael,15
17500,Conference room?,jim,2
17501,"Maybe the conference room, maybe the annex.  I'm just saying, at least right here [indicates floor in front of his office] is cursed.  Conference room, 10 minutes.",michael,29
17502,"On the one hand, it's a relief to know that it's not just me, the whole office is cursed.  On the other hand, I may have to deal with the dark unknown.",michael,33
17503,Question: Has anyone recently offended a Gypsy?,dwight,7
17504,We have to have done something wrong.,michael,7
17506,"That was the curse, Stanley, and we are trying to find the cause of the curse.",michael,16
17507,Mmm.  [nods],dwight,3
17508,"Oscar, are you Santaria?",michael,4
17510,"Oh.  Great.  We have a secular humanist here, that is disgusting.",michael,13
17512,Yes.  It is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition.,michael,21
17514,Stupid.,michael,1
17515,"My cousin Mose's best friend was a dog.  One day, he was foaming at the mouth, so I had to shoot him dead.  Turns out, he had only eaten one of Mose's cream pies.  Did I feel bad for killing him?  No.  That's how you deal with a thief.",dwight,54
17517,"Whoa, 'scuse me!  Oh!",michael,5
17519,"Oh, slow!  Oh, ho, ho, ho. [laughing as he passes Phyllis and Bob]  You guys are going so slow...",michael,21
17521,"Come on, I'm going backwards.",michael,5
17523,"Oh, all right!  All right!  All right!  All right!",michael,12
17525,"Okay! [Bob Vance and Michael in an all-out sprint, Michael grunting]",michael,11
17527,Thanks.,michael,1
17530,"Well, apparently, my insurance will not be covering this hospital stay.  I will be paying out-of-pocket.  Um... I kinda wish I'd been hit by a car.",michael,28
17531,"Hey, doc?  You forgetting something? [pediatrician takes a lollypop from his pocket and gives it to Michael]  Thank you.",michael,21
17532,Hey.,pam,1
17533,Hey.,jim,1
17534,I gotcha one. [Pam hands over a grape soda to Jim],pam,11

17536,Yeah.,pam,1
17537,"I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some?",jim,9
17538,"No. Thanks... uh we're still having lunch today, right?",pam,9
17539,"I guess. [Pam smiles and walks away, then comes back and kisses Jim on the cheek] How dare you.",jim,19
17540,Hey Toby. What's this? [holds up memo Toby has passed out to the staff],michael,14
17542,[reads memo] I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.,michael,19
17544,Oh really.,michael,2
17550,[turns to address Jim and Pam] No way.,michael,8
17551,What?,dwight,1
17553,"Ummm... yup. Yes, we are.",jim,5

17556,Awesome!,michael,1
17558,You guys! Yes! Yes!,michael,4

17562,"Actually, we've been dating for a couple months.",jim,8
17563,"I love you guys, so much. [hugs Jim]",michael,8
17564,"Ohh.. [Michael goes to hug Pam, phone rings]",jim,8
17565,Phone's ringing. [goes back toward desk],pam,6
17566,"No, no, no Pam let 'em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is [starts to well up] really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.",michael,37
17567,I don't see it. I think they both could do better.,dwight,11
17569,Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?,andy,17
17570,Hey. Can you make that straighter? That's what she said.,michael,10
17572,"No. [tries to hide piece of paper, but Pam grabs it]",michael,11
17573,[reading from paper] Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?,pam,27
17574,Blowing up balloons I thought.,michael,5
17575,You might want to trim it a little.,pam,8
17578,"Yeah, he is.",pam,3
17580,Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.,michael,19
17582,To give you this [reveals a cat from under a coat].,dwight,11
17584,It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.,dwight,25
17586,And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. [shakes cat] Don't you Garbage? [makes chomping noises],dwight,23
17588,You haven't buried her yet?,dwight,5
17590,"Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. [holds cat towards Angela] Look at him.",dwight,24
17592,Hey Toby.,pam,2
17594,"Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company.",jim,27
17596,Oh.,jim,1
17597,"Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but, it's like pretty official. [Jim smiles]",pam,14
17599,"Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?",jim,9
17601,What?,jim,1
17603,"Oh, OK.",jim,2
17604,OK.,pam,1
17605,Great. [Jim and Pam walk away],jim,6

17609,Yeah.,pam,1
17610,"There he is! There he is! He's back! And he's with a beard. [laughing] He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I'm Tubs.",michael,36
17612,"Ohh, yeah, let's get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm..",michael,17
17614,...business meeting --,michael,3
17617,That's right! That's right!,michael,4
17619,"Fire guy. Don't start any fires, Ryan.",michael,7
17620,Fire guy [makes flames with his hands],andy,7
17622,Here for what?,andy,3
17624,"Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You're like our little man...",michael,23
17627,Beard.,michael,1
17630,"Oh, wow!",michael,2
17632,That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way.,michael,9
17634,Woooo![laughs] I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.,michael,10
17636,"Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let's get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in [looks at Ryan] 10 minutes?",michael,35
17638,"Sounds good. OK, alright.",michael,4
17641,"Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. [Jim at his desk, showing the Dunder Mifflin website reading 'Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!']",jim,39
17643,"OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.",michael,7
17645,What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?,dwight,15
17647,Got it. [Andy's hand goes up],dwight,6
17649,"We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together?",andy,12
17653,Ryan Howard everybody. [starts clapping] Good job. [everyone gets up to leave],michael,12
17658,Who is?,michael,2
17660,I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.,michael,12
17662,"Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.",jim,32
17663,No.. [in awe],pam,3
17664,"Swear to God. [Pam shakes her head]. Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.",jim,28
17665,"No, they have been dating for like two years. [Jim in shock] Since before your barbeque.",pam,16
17666,Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn't say anything?,jim,13
17667,You didn't say anything to me?,pam,6
17668,Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.,jim,13
17669,Can you believe that...,pam,4
17671,"Oh no, we're just sitting here.",jim,6
17673,OK.,pam,1
17675,OK.,jim,1
17676,And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.,jim,11
17678,"Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?",michael,24
17680,"Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no?",michael,17
17682,"Good, so, we're on the same page?",michael,7
17708,Hello.,dwight,1
17710,Really?,dwight,1
17712,"I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.",dwight,19
17715,Hi.,pam,1
17717,In his office. You can go right in.,pam,8
17731,Hey.,michael,1
17733,"[holds up Blackberry] Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?",michael,16
17735,I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.,michael,15
17737,"Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.",michael,39
17739,Well...,michael,1
17741,What is that... word?,michael,4
17743,So older people have just as many rights as younger people?,michael,11
17751,Michael told us to wait in here. We don't know why.,pam,11
17753,"Good, we're all here, we can get started.",michael,8
17755,Have a seat.,michael,3
17757,Have a seat. Like everybody else.,michael,6
17761,"Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?",michael,16
17763,"No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. [points to her picture on the wall] Or the funny things that they can do, like 'where's the Beef?' [points to another picture on wall] [Jim raises his hand] Yeah.",michael,54
17764,"Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.",jim,18
17765,"Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too.",pam,5
17766,"I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.",michael,20
17767,Oh. [man enters conference room],pam,5
17769,"[puts hand up] That is me. Come on in. [They shake hands] Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh? [starts clapping, others join in]",michael,59
17770,"Oh, yeah. Yes!",dwight,3
17773,Sure thing. [both go out of conference room] 'Scuse me. [closes door],michael,12
17775,Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt. [they glare at each other],michael,31
17776,"Bob, how old are you?",michael,5
17778,"Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?",michael,24
17780,"Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.",michael,9
17781,"I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.",dwight,43
17783,Wow.,michael,1
17785,"Oh, boy.",michael,2
17787,Great.,michael,1
17789,Great.,michael,1
17791,That's great. Thank you for coming in. [starts ushering him out] Robert Dunder everybody. [clapping] Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?,michael,25
17793,Perfect. [starts closing the door],michael,5
17795,"Inspirational. What have we learned?  Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail. [Pam raises hand]",michael,31
17796,I think that I should help him get home.,pam,9
17797,"No, No. Don't help him. He doesn't need help, Pam. [Jim nods head and Pam gets up and leaves to help Robert Dunder, Michael shows Robert thumbs up] What a nice guy.",michael,32
17798,Good night guys. [staff leaves the office],michael,7
17800,"I disagree, I think it was very valuable.",michael,8
17802,I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.,michael,17
17807,Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?,dwight,6
17809,Dry. Delicious.,dwight,2
17811,"Oh, that's funny.",dwight,3
17813,Are you enjoying your mineral water?,dwight,6
17815,"Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here [points to middle of forehead above the eyes], it's an old sales trick.",dwight,22
17817,"No, please don't do this, monkey.",dwight,6
17820,Hi.,pam,1
17821,"Hey, Amy.  How ya doing?",jim,6
17822,Nice to meet you.,pam,4
17823,[under his breath] Nice to meet you.,jim,7
17831,"Whoa, Toby.  Watch out.  You're going to violate your own PDA memo.",pam,14
17833,Smell that. Do you smell that?,michael,6
17834,Dry rot?,dwight,2
17835,"No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.",michael,28
17836,"Mmhmm, sweet, chocolate turtles.",andy,4
17837,"Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. I'll explain, later.",michael,14
17838,"Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IM's, but I think he's forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food.",michael,28
17839,"Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items.",dwight,16
17841,You're welcome.,dwight,2
17843,Yes... [whispers] I miss you.,dwight,5
17846,Fine. [sighs] Then I just want to be friends.,dwight,9
17848,"Plus a little extra. Also, I love you.",dwight,8
17859,Hey.,jim,1
17860,Hey.,pam,1
17861,"Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?",jim,15
17862,It's funny you bring that up because yes it is.,pam,10
17863,"I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?",jim,9
17864,"I think... I mean, I don't know what it is but...",pam,11
17865,Be honest.,jim,2
17866,I now find you repulsive.,pam,5
17867,"That's honest. [sighs] Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?",jim,16
17868,Eh...,pam,1
17869,"For me, it was.",jim,4
17870,OK.,pam,1
17871,Alright.,jim,1
17872,"Hey boss, I didn't know you were coming in today.",michael,10
17874,"I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back.",michael,50
17876,"With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? That's what people like.",michael,29
17878,"OK. We're gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy.",michael,13
17880,I'll go with you Stanley.,andy,5
17882,Why don't we just go by ourselves?,jim,7
17883,Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?,michael,11
17885,Yes?,michael,1
17887,"OK, that's not helpful Phyllis.",michael,5
17889,"Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.",michael,24
17890,"What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... it's kind of the best gift ever.",andy,23
17891,What about a gift basket full of cash?,jim,8
17892,Yes! Cash basket! Nice work Tuna.,andy,6
17893,"Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me. [walks toward the door]",michael,28
17894,"Michael, wait. Let me go.",dwight,5
17895,"No, this is my quest.",michael,5
17896,"Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back. [camera moves around and zooms in at Angela's face] Please.",dwight,21
17897,Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.,michael,8
17899,We don't need luck.,michael,4
17900,Yeah.,dwight,1
17901,"But thank you, that was really nice of you to say.",michael,11
17902,Thank you.,dwight,2
17903,"Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people.",michael,24
17906,"[in Michael's car] Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?",dwight,12
17907,It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.,michael,20
17908,"Ah, that's a pain in the ass.",dwight,7
17909,I know. So who's next?,michael,5
17910,Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.,dwight,10
17912,Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.,dwight,15
17913,Who?,michael,1
17914,"The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends. [sobs and then starts to cry]",dwight,13
17918,"Dude, you are so money, but you don't even know it, but you do.",andy,14
17921,Later man.,andy,2
17923,"Yeah, he's definitely something.",jim,4
17925,"That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?",jim,10
17926,Ha! Tuna... [inhales deeply] Tuna Tuna Tuna.,andy,7
17928,"He has a killer job, he's rich, he smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like, he wears really cool rich guy clothes.",andy,25
17930,"So, sorry Tuna but if you don't know why that's awesome... then... you need awesome lessons.",andy,16
17932,"[places the gift basket on top of the table] Wow, those things are heavy! There's a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, um, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps?",michael,37
17934,Yes we do.,michael,3
17936,"Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you.",dwight,12
17937,Well...,michael,1
17938,"And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us.",dwight,30
17939,Mmhmm.,michael,1
17941,"Please, come back.",dwight,3
17942,"OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch.",michael,17
17943,Remember what we had Larry?,dwight,5
17945,"Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket.",michael,7
17947,Alright.,michael,1
17949,[driving] That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?,michael,15
17950,I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.,dwight,13
17951,That is true.,michael,3
17952,Like Angela in accounting.,dwight,4
17953,"Yes, she is nuts.",michael,4
17954,"Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.",dwight,11
17956,How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive.,michael,14
17958,Uh totally.,pam,2
17960,Yeah.,pam,1
17962,Thank you.,pam,2
17964,OK.,pam,1
17965,"Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some... splash frames. [laughs] I don't know what I'm talking about but I'm excited.",pam,29
17966,"And the last guy says 'No, hairy body'.",michael,8
17968,"Ah, well it's still very good. I bet I know someone who hasn't heard that joke... your daughter Emily. How's she doing?",michael,22
17972,"OK, OK! So you'll reconsider?",michael,5
17974,Ah... .is that all you have to say?,michael,8
17976,You don't know?,dwight,3
17977,"Look, we want you back.",michael,5
17979,"Well, no.",michael,2
17981,"He's not coming back, it's over Michael.",dwight,7
17982,No it's not.,michael,3
17984,"Accept it, why would he come back?",dwight,7
17985,"Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.",michael,39
17986,That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.,dwight,17
17987,"Look... we're also coming out with a website soon. It's a state of the art thing, it'll be up and running, it's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier.",michael,33
17989,"Great, the magic of the gift basket.",michael,7
17991,"OK, good. Don't let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, she's alergic.",michael,13
17993,"[in Michael's car] Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side.",dwight,24
17994,"I don't get it, I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing.",michael,24
17995,"That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.",dwight,23
17996,"That is a very good point, Dwight.",michael,7
17998,"Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.",dwight,12
17999,"No, it said right, it said take a right.",michael,9
18000,"No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.",dwight,21
18001,Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right. [turns right],michael,13
18002,It can't mean that! There's a lake there!,dwight,8
18003,The machine knows where it is going!,michael,7
18004,This is the lake!,dwight,4
18005,The machine knows--- stop yelling at me!,michael,7
18006,"No, it's--- there's no road here! [car drives into lake]",dwight,10
18007,"Remain calm! I have trained for this! [unfastens seat belt] Okay, exit the window! [Dwight and Michael exit through the window] Here we go! Look out for leeches! [swims toward Michael] Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you! [Dwight grabs onto Michael while Michael opens the back door for the camera man] Michael! Michael!",dwight,56
18008,"Let go, let go of me!",michael,6
18009,"I got you, I got you! [Michael and Dwight reach the ground]",dwight,12
18010,[watching car get pulled from lake] You sure you're OK?,michael,10
18011,Fine.,dwight,1
18012,"Good, that is what's most important.",michael,6
18013,Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.,dwight,17
18014,"What a disaster, this whole thing.",michael,6
18015,I'll call a cab. [brings out cell phone],dwight,8
18016,"These people just don't realize what a gift basket means, they don't get it.",michael,14
18017,"Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone.",dwight,9
18018,"What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. 'I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy'. Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us.",michael,36
18019,"[speaking on the cell phone] Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.",dwight,23
18020,Hang up. [Dwight hangs up] You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket!,michael,27
18021,Yes!,dwight,1
18022,"We're gonna take what's rightfully ours! We're gonna take a stand, Dwight! We're gonna take a stand!",michael,17
18023,Take a stand!,dwight,3
18024,"So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? I'd love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo.",pam,29
18026,Thanks.,pam,1
18028,That'd be great.,pam,3
18030,Oh... is it...,pam,3
18032,No...,pam,1
18034,Um...,pam,1
18036,"I'm uh, I'm dating Jim.",pam,5
18038,We're together.,pam,2
18040,"Yeah, great.",pam,2
18042,OK great!,pam,2
18044,Great.,pam,1
18045,I guess he can't get any girl he wants.,jim,9
18047,"Give it back. The gift basket, give it back.",michael,9
18049,"It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.",dwight,16
18051,"Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, let's leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches! [sits on couch]",michael,35
18052,"Can you call us a cab please, I'm gonna [gets water from his clothes on the couch] Oops, sorry!",dwight,19
18053,"Look, my clothes are so wet!",michael,6
18054,"Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy! [rubs shoes on couch]",dwight,12
18056,It's been opened.,michael,3
18058,What's missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles?,michael,12
18060,WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY?,michael,7
18061,"[enters nearby room] Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!",dwight,40
18063,[leaving] We'll bill you.,dwight,4
18064,"May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now.",michael,18
18066,Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.,michael,18
18068,"I drove my car into a [bleep] lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me.",michael,49
18069,Into a lake.,jim,3
18070,Exactly!,michael,1
18072,"Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybody's lives. [looks at Ryan] Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game.",michael,33
18073,"Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.",michael,46
18076,I know.  I love it there.,jim,7
18078,"Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.",jim,13
18080,Sounds great.,jim,2
18082,Yeee... (grunts in frustration),jim,4
18085,"Oh, Okay.  Okay.  Just...[Michael takes down banner, clears throat]  Well, our old friend Ryan Howard is back, and we're going to give a little presentation about the future of our company.  So please listen up. [awkward pause] All right.",michael,43
18087,You don't want me to help?,michael,6
18089,Yes?,michael,1
18091,I got it.,pam,3
18093,"[laughs] Um... yes, I'll be right back!",michael,7
18095,"That was slightly harsh, don't you think?",jim,7
18097,"I think I know what's going on.  Ryan believes that there is some sort of special 'boss water' that he gets to drink now.  And there isn't.  But, um... don't tell him.  Don't tell him that.  I don't want to jeopardize our friendship.",michael,48
18098,Ryan is causing some problems.  And you were always good at handling him.  What should I do to control him?,michael,22
18100,"I know, I know, no, what... something else.",michael,8
18102,Uh-huh.,michael,1
18104,Good.,michael,1
18106,My generation's all about hard work and accomplishment.  Like... the moon landing.  Or Vietnam.  Rolling Stones.  Greatest band ever.,michael,23
18110,"No, I skipped through all of the boring stuff and went right to his joke page.  Which proves that he was old, but he was also hilarious.",michael,28
18112,I'm not.  It's solitaire.  See?,michael,7
18113,BlackBerry.  Why would anyone name something like this after a fruit?  You wouldn't name an iPod after a fruit.  [drops BlackBerry on desk]  Excuse me while I type on my Banana.  I'm gonna go to the Orange store and buy an Apricot computer.  [thinks] Apple. [nods],michael,52
18114,This is going on the outside.  The pipe cleaner needs to go through the corner.  Do not tape those on.,michael,22
18115,"Hey, Michael.",pam,2
18116,Mmhmm.,michael,1
18117,Jan called and asked where you're going to meet for dinner.  She wants you to call her.,pam,18
18118,I'm a little busy right now.  Could you BlackBerry me a message?,michael,13
18119,Sure.,pam,1
18120,"Michael doesn't know how to work his BlackBerry.  So when he says BlackBerry me a message, he means write it on a Post-it note and stick it to his BlackBerry.",pam,31
18122,"You didn't set up your BlackBerry, Dwight?",jim,7
18123,"Yes, I did, but I do not intend to use it.  It is pointless technology.",dwight,16
18124,As opposed to...,jim,3
18125,Printing press.  Tractor.  Mechanical thresher.  Telephone.  Airplane.  The only inventions that matter.,dwight,17
18126,What about cars?,jim,3
18127,They fall under the category of airplanes.,dwight,7
18128,"They do?  So, cars are flightless airplanes.",jim,8
18129,Correct.,dwight,1
18130,Got it.  They're like the penguins of the airplane family.,jim,11
18131,That's an excellent analogy.,dwight,4
18132,Thanks.,jim,1
18133,"Hey, Dwight, what about vaccines?",pam,5
18134,[scoffs] Vaccines are for chumps!,dwight,5
18135,My mom didn't believe in vaccines.  I got my smallpox the old-fashioned way.  And I survived.  So... joke's on you hospitals.,dwight,24
18149,"I saw it.  I saw it, and it was amazing!  Who said I didn't see it?  Did Jim say that I didn't see it? I saw it!",pam,30
18150,We have a lot of colored paper here... why oh why do we keep printing this on white? [screen saver box hits the wall],michael,24
18151,Dah!  Come on!,andy,4
18152,Yeah!  I know.  I know.  It's bland.,michael,10
18155,"Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?",michael,8
18156,[to Pam] Wait for it.,jim,5
18157,"Like, something that you have to look for.  Sort of a 'Where's Waldo.' [screensaver box hits the corner of the screen]",michael,22
18159,[everyone gets up and leaves the conference room] Alright. Alright.  Let's quit while we're ahead.,michael,16
18161,That was awesome. Thank you.,michael,5
18162,Some days I am just on fire.  What can I say?,michael,12
18164,"Hey Meredith, how you feelin'?",jim,5
18166,"Oh, please, it was my pleasure.  Well we all came, so...",jim,12
18168,Haha...,jim,1
18170,Uh-huh.,jim,1
18172,MmmHmm...,jim,1
18174,Oh yeah.,jim,2
18176,Alright...,jim,1
18177,Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about.  Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.,pam,20
18178,"Oh, does he?",michael,3
18179,He does.,pam,2
18181,Whoops.  Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?,jim,12
18182,And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.,michael,8
18184,"The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 6:00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company.  Wow!  Watch out Dwight.",michael,28
18185,That's ridiculous.  I'm not going to be beaten by a website.,dwight,12
18186,Actually it sounds like you are.,jim,6
18187,Really?  'Cause Ryan says so?,dwight,6
18189,No.  It doesn't.  I'll find out tonight.,michael,9
18191,"I can make more sales than a computer.  In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.",dwight,22
18193,"What's that, pipsqueak?",michael,3
18195,You believe a computer can beat me?,dwight,7
18197,Well I will prove you wrong.,dwight,6
18199,We'll see.,dwight,2
18201,Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat.  It's very complicated.  It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela.  Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.,pam,28
18207,And this is where I will record your sales.,andy,9
18208,Hmm.  Very nice.  Very nice.,dwight,7
18209,"And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done.",andy,13
18210,Or zipadeedoodaah.,jim,2
18211,I can't tell if he's mocking me.,andy,7
18212,Just ignore him.,dwight,3
18213,"Ehh, can't do that.  Really hard for me to let things go.",andy,13
18214,I was... mocking.,jim,3
18215,Thank you.,andy,2
18216,I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.,dwight,15
18217,Yes like a chime or a bell...,andy,7
18218,Or a gong.,jim,3
18219,Go to my car.  Open the trunk.  Inside you will see many pelts.  Under the smallest one is a case.  Inside that case is a bear horn.  Bring it to me.,dwight,36
18220,Yes!,andy,1
18230,"Ohh, lunch party.",michael,3
18232,"Okay, wow!  Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.",michael,12

18240,"Uhyeaahhh!  Hello, Susan?  Dwight Schrute.",dwight,7
18241,What would you say if I told you we could pull a prank on Dwight and at the same time not be working?,jim,23
18242,Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.,dwight,11
18243,What?,jim,1
18244,He's going through a break-up.,pam,5
18245,"Yeah, I'm aware of that.  But he's also being super annoying.  And I'm not a perfect person.",jim,19
18246,[blowing air horn] Yeah!,andy,4
18247,"Three reams! Yoohoo... in your face, machines.",dwight,7
18248,What kind of prank are you thinking?,pam,7
18249,What if I told you I could offer free shipping?  Sure.  I'll hold.,dwight,15
18251,[on monitor] You tell me.,dwight,5
18252,[dictating to Pam] Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.,jim,41
18254,[on monitor] How do I know this isn't Jim?,dwight,9
18257,Okay.,michael,1
18258,Yes it's too tight.,pam,4

18275,Just...,michael,1
18277,Yeah.,michael,1

18283,Do I have your permission to invite Carol?,michael,8
18285,I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  It's just the first... girl that popped into my head.  I'll find somebody I haven't slept with.,michael,23

18295,So.  This is the dealio.  God has smiled upon me and given me two tickets to the big party in New York tonight.  What are you doing this evening?  Look at that.  They have their own little language now. Like twins.,michael,46
18296,Sure we'll go.,jim,3

18305,Tie goes to the girlfriend.,pam,5
18306,"No, I realize you normally reorder in November, but what I'm suggesti... you did what?  Ah no!  That's exactly what you're not supposed to do, damnit!  Why would you reorder from a computer when you can have the personal touch of a salesman?  Ahhhhh. [hangs up phone]",dwight,51
18307,How's it going?,jim,3
18308,Fine.  Good.,dwight,3

18322,Hey man.,jim,2
18324,What's going on?,jim,3
18326,Oh yeah?,jim,2
18328,What are you doing?  I am in the fight of my life against this computer and every sale counts.,dwight,20

18341,"I am not a bad person.  When I left Staples, I took some of their leads with me but I never intended to use them.  What did I intend to do with them?  Who knows?  Maybe keep them as a souvenir.  Maybe use them.",dwight,49
18342,"Yes, Mr. Galliado.  How would you like to pay ten percent less for paper than you're paying right now?  It's not important how I got your information.  What is important is that you say yes.  Good.",dwight,40

18352,"I'm sorry.  Am, so sorry.  I... yes.  Uh, could you repeat that?",dwight,15
18353,Yesss!  Ten reams for the US District Court!  Did I happen to mention the forty reams for the battered women's shelter?,dwight,23
18354,No !  [blows air horn and dances],andy,8
18355,Huh?!,dwight,1
18357,Did you see the board?,dwight,5
18359,You ever read this? [holds up Green Eggs and Ham],michael,10
18360,"Yep.  A long time ago, but, I liked it.",jim,10
18361,"Got it for Ryan.  Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out.  Figured...",michael,21
18362,Yeah.,jim,1
18363,Same sort of stuff in here.,michael,6

18385,Yes.,michael,1
18386,Yep.,jim,1
18388,You know what this is like?  I'll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn't let any of the Seniors go.,michael,32
18389,Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?,michael,16
18390,Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.,jim,6

18411,Alright who wants to party?,michael,5
18413,"Ohhh, what?  Oh I think I faked Oscar out.",michael,10
18415,I think I faked Stanley out too.  Who else thought that I was leaving?  And they could all go home early?  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Well who needs New York?  Right?  We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.,michael,48
18417,Nope nope nope no.  This is going to be nothing like the party you've been planning.  This is going to be good and everybody's gonna come.  What's wrong with Dwight?,michael,33
18418,He beat the computer.,andy,4

18421,How we doing on time?,michael,5

18433,Uh...,michael,1
18435,I want it...,michael,3
18437,"I want it to embarrass all other parties.  I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, 'Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?'",michael,37
18439,Yes you can.,michael,3
18441,Yes you can.  I know you can.  I wouldn't say that if I didn't hundred percent believe it.  Who else could do this?,michael,26
18443,No seriously.  Is there anyone else who could do it better?  Because we don't have a lot of time.  I'll get the pizza!,michael,26
18444,What do you think of Angela?,andy,6
18445,I think she's efficient.,dwight,4
18446,"No, not like that, as a woman.  W-O-M-A-N.",andy,9
18447,I hadn't noticed.,dwight,3
18448,You hadn't noticed she's a woman?,andy,6
18449,[impatient sigh],dwight,2
18450,"I hear she's single and ready to mingle.  I'm thinking about making a play for her.  What do you think?  Crazy, right?",andy,25
18451,I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with.,dwight,10
18452,Isn't that part of the fun?,andy,6
18453,No.  I think you should date Kelly.,dwight,8
18454,"She works here too, how is that any different?",andy,9

18486,Yup.,michael,1
18487,The Pizza by Alfredo guy is here.,pam,7
18488,You don't have to say it like that.,michael,8
18489,I said it normal.,pam,4
18490,Hey,michael,1
18492,"Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.",michael,17
18494,"Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.",michael,13
18496,You didn't actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?,michael,13
18498,"Okay, it doesn't say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it's policy, it should say it on the coupon.",michael,20
18500,[sarcastic shrugging of shoulders] What do you mean hmm-um?,michael,9
18502,"It is your problem.  That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off.  End of story.",michael,32
18504,I'm not giving that to you.,michael,6
18506,"No, no you're not going anywhere.  You're staying here until we figure this out.",michael,15
18510,"Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza.  Please, thank you.",michael,26

18519,I've seen this kid before. He's one the kids who sneaks on my farm and steals my hemp.,dwight,18
18521,You ready to give me my discount now?,michael,8
18523,"Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?",michael,11
18525,We're a paper company.  The best paper company in the whole wide world.,dwight,14
18526,"Alright, Dwight, knock it off.  You better think about what you are doing young man.",michael,16
18528,"No!  I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything.  You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot shot, and you don't know anything about sales.  So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?",michael,50
18530,"Yeah sales, you sell pizza.  Last time I checked that's called sales.",michael,13
18532,What did you just call him?,dwight,6
18534,What did you say?,dwight,4
18536,"Alright stop, stop making him say it!  You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.",michael,17
18537,"I can make him talk, Michael.",dwight,6
18539,Stop talking all at once!,michael,5
18540,You need to let him go.,jim,6
18541,Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?,michael,13
18542,Yes.,jim,1
18543,"You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.",michael,19
18544,"Yes, but not by kidnapping.",jim,5
18545,"I'm not kidnapping him, I'm keeping him until I get what I want.",michael,13
18546,As a hostage.,jim,3

18548,I think you're under-thinking it.,jim,5
18550,Ransom.,jim,1
18551,"Trouble.  Okay, alright.",michael,4
18552,What did he say?,jim,4
18553,He said no.,michael,3
18554,"So, we should let him go.",jim,6
18555,"No, no.",michael,2
18556,Okay.,jim,1
18557,"Listen up kid.  [pops balloon with his hands]  I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights.",dwight,25
18560,Hey!,dwight,1
18562,Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.,jim,11
18563,"Mister Overdramatic, what's up Kevin?",michael,5

18580,I'm all over it.,pam,4
18581,Okay.,jim,1
18582,What have we got here?,jim,5
18584,"Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?",jim,8
18586,Which one's this? Perfect.,jim,4
18587,"Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?",jim,23
18588,"Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight.",pam,21
18589,And that's when I knew. You?,jim,6
18590,"You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and there's no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired.",pam,32
18591,That was the moment that you knew you liked me?,jim,10
18592,Yep.,pam,1
18593,"Wow, can we make it a different moment?",jim,8
18594,Nope.,pam,1
18597,"Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that [bleep]hole.",michael,20
18601,You said your upper back itched.,andy,6
18603,"Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I've repulsed you, but I like you.",andy,24
18605,"So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested.",andy,17
18606,[smiles],dwight,1
18607,"But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I can't back down.",andy,17

18611,Ahh-chaa!,dwight,1
18612,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?",michael,8
18613,I'm just scaring him.  The trick is to make him think you're going to do something to him.,dwight,19
18615,"Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat!",dwight,11
18616,"Hey, hey, hey stop it.  Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no.  I kidnapped a kid.",michael,24
18617,"You had to, what other choice did you have?",dwight,9
18618,I could have paid for the pizza.,michael,7
18619,"Well, yeah.",dwight,2
18620,"Oh my God, oh my God.",michael,6
18621,This is Michael.,michael,3
18623,You're breaking up. I can't hear you.,michael,7

18626,What will you do?,dwight,4
18627,I will open the door.,michael,5
18628,Yeah.,dwight,1
18629,"And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.",michael,14
18630,"So, I'm paying full price?",dwight,5
18631,Yes.,michael,1
18632,"Here we go, sixty-five.  You know what?  There's two more.",dwight,12
18633,"See ya, drive safely.",michael,4
18634,[pizza guy flips him off] Okay.,michael,6
18635,Now what?,dwight,2
18636,"Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.",michael,7

18695,How long have you been a man?,jim,7
18696,"I was born a man, Halpert.",dwight,6
18697,That must have been extremely uncomfortable for your mom.,jim,9
18699,[to Dwight] What do you think of Angela?  There's just something about her.  All that strength and steeliness and righteousness all wrapped up tight and shoved into a tiny little delicate frame.,andy,34
18701,What's wrong with me?,michael,4
18702,Excuse me?,pam,2
18703,"I want you to look at me and tell me what is wrong with me. [Pam stares and nods]  Don't avoid this.  I know you're dying to say it, so just say it.",michael,35

18786,Do you run the bed and breakfest?,jim,7
18787,It is not a B and B.,dwight,7
18788,"Agrotourism is a lot more than a bed and breakfest. It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them brekafest.",dwight,28
18789,Does the Department of Health know about this?,jim,8
18790,"I'm not telling you anything. [lookings into the camera] Permits are pending. [phone rings] Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.",dwight,18

18798,Two?,pam,1

18801,"Oh! Um, actually, I need the car.",michael,7
18803,"Use to have two cars, traded 'em in, now we're down to one. Good economic sense. Although the new car is a Porsche. For her.",michael,25
18804,"One cardigan, one sleeping cardigan and one sleep apnea mask.",dwight,10
18806,You took that with you.,dwight,5

18826,I wouldn't understand or a secret?,jim,6
18827,"You wouldn't understand, Jim. It's a secret.",pam,7

18832,Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon!,pam,7

18834,I don't know! [Mose starts running by the left side of the car],pam,13
18835,Oh my gosh.,pam,3
18836,"I just love sales. I love it to death. It's as simple as that. And I don't get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing.",michael,43

18852,"Mose, bags! Now!",dwight,3
18853,"Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms. But as soon as I find out where Mose hid all the wires, we'll get that power back on. All righty.",dwight,53
18855,These meetings are useless.,michael,4
18857,Very inspirational. [laughter],michael,3
18860,Or a trained seal. [laughter],michael,5
18862,"Hmmm, I'd say 1 in 6.",jim,6
18863,What?,pam,1
18864,"Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.",jim,15

18875,[speaking with a different voice] Have you--- Have you considered satellite television?,michael,12

18882,"Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes---",michael,16
18884,It is not a waste of our time.,michael,8

18891,"[reading to Jim, Pam, and Mose] And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. 'Harry?'

18892,What did you get tonight?,michael,5
18894,"Oh, that looks good.",michael,4
18896,I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.,michael,9

18900,Really?,michael,1
18902,Wonder what I would've been back home?,michael,7
18904,"I know, but it's competitive here. What's a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.",michael,25
18906,I would've been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy.,michael,9

18964,"No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.",michael,16
18966,"My other boss, Mr. Figaro.",michael,5
18968,What I do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business'.,michael,19

18971,It won't.,michael,2
18973,"Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways. [Kelly laughs]",michael,14
18985,"Why don't you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?",michael,13
18987,"Huh, okay.",michael,2

19023,So.,andy,1
19024,What's up?,pam,2
19025,Me.  All night.  Dreaming about Angela's smoking hot body.,andy,11

19034,She's very religious.,pam,3
19035,"Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses.",andy,15
19036,"Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.",pam,14

19038,"That's right, you did.",pam,4
19039,Yeah.,andy,1

19068,"Oh, I hate monkeys.",michael,4
19069,"What's going on, why do you have a second job?",pam,10
19070,I don't have a second job.  Maybe I'm having an affair with Suzanne Summers.,michael,15
19071,Doesn't Jan have money?,pam,4
19072,"I don't talk to my girlfriend about money.  It is rude, and unsexual.",michael,14
19074,"I totally agree with you.  But I don't have money problems, I don't.  Alright, you know what?  Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this? [Michael holds up a bill, crumples it up, puts it back in his pocket]",michael,45

19085,No you didn't.,michael,3
19088,"How would that help Creed?  In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.",michael,14
19090,That is a good point.,michael,5
19092,Like the witness protection program.,michael,5
19095,"I've always wanted to be in the witness protection program.  Fresh start, no debts, no baggage.  I've already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton.  I'm a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs.  That's the life.",michael,41

19105,"Oh, that's the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.",michael,8
19108,"I left a little present for Angela.  I think she's going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together.  I got game.",andy,50
19110,Mm-hm.  That is so cool how you have my name at the top.,michael,14
19112,Right.,michael,1
19114,How do they do this so fast?  Is this power-point?,michael,11

19117,"No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this.",michael,11
19119,"We will find another way, we'll ask power-point.",michael,8
19121,You're a presentation tool if you think I'm gonna tell Jan about this.,michael,13
19123,"No you're not! Ok, just... you're not a tool. Look, we'll tell her that it's bad, but it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half.",michael,39
19125,She poses.,michael,2
19126,"Dwight, how's the hotel business?",jim,5

19155,Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?,jim,9
19156,[incoherent mumbling] No you didn't.,dwight,5
19157,"Yeah, I didn't think I had.  Well, it was all about Pam.",jim,13

19161,"Hey, I was thinking about dinner--- [Jim grabs her face and kisses her]",pam,13
19162,"Ah, dinner.  Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.",jim,19
19163,Okay.,pam,1
19164,Yeah?,jim,1
19165,Yeah.,pam,1
19166,Okay.,jim,1
19167,Jim's just really passionate about Italian food.,pam,7

19177,I'm out of answers Jan.,michael,5

19191,Don't sell your implants please.,michael,5
19193,That's nice though.,michael,3
19195,It looks cute though.,michael,4
19196,I used to get offers in the mail for credit cards all the time.  They would say things like 'don't pay for six months' or 'you can transfer your account from another card'...,michael,34

19201,What... [mumbling],dwight,2

19222,I've been putting money into CDs for years.  I bought music that I didn't even like.  No. [shakes head],michael,21
19224,I can't.,michael,2
19226,I can't go back to that.,michael,6
19228,I don't know if I can do that.  I can't see myself spending the next six years digging myself out of that kind of hole.,michael,26

19246,That is impossible.  Unless you mean gonorrhea.,dwight,8
19247,"I'm talking about Angela, okay?  Did you hear what she was saying to Pam the other day?",andy,18
19248,"Yes, I did, 'cept I don't think she means it.  Angela is in a great deal of pain because of the death of her cat, and she's in a kind of a grieving process, and it makes her say things.  So... best to just lay off.",dwight,48
19249,No can do.  I am itching all over with Angela-pox.,andy,11
19250,"Oh my God, you do have gonorrhea.",jim,7

19282,The office.,jim,2
19284,Hmm.,jim,1
19285,"Mose, Angela hasn't been around here much lately, has she?",pam,10
19287,Angela - she used to stay here sometimes?,pam,8
19290,"Okay, we're watching, Mose!",pam,4
19292,"You're doin' great, buddy!",jim,4

19304,"We are making a commercial for Dunder Mifflin today. Our first ad ever.  Corporate purchased some air time in local markets to spread the word about Dunder Mifflin Infinity and they are even sending up a professional ad company to help us make it later so... it's uh, not too shabby.",michael,52
19305,"Best ad ever. [sings in the tune of the 'Kit Kat theme song'] Gimme a break, gimme a break, break me off a piece of that... I am totally blanking. What is the thing?",andy,34

19327,"All right, good, well this is what we have to work with.",michael,12
19328,I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'Nard Dog. Who let the 'Nard Dog out?,michael,17
19329,Hoo hoo hoo-hoo!,andy,3
19330,He gives the best back rubs in the office.,michael,9
19331,"It's true, I give a mean backrub. I also do good aromatherapy [makes farting noise]. Not! You just got 'Nard dogged!",andy,21
19332,Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.,michael,12
19334,Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.,michael,16
19335,"These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun.",michael,37
19337,Who else?,michael,2
19338,"I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.",jim,56
19339,You playing that game again?,jim,5

19341,Oh it has losers.,jim,4
19342,I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly. [shot of Dwight's avatar flying around],dwight,55
19345,"Actually I don't get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so...",michael,19
19347,"Yeah, I know.",michael,3
19349,"Mmm. Okay. [commercial plays on laptop, peppy music in background]",michael,10
19350,That's what Nassau came up with? That sucks! [chuckles] Whoa.,michael,10
19352,Well we can do better than that.,michael,7
19355,The waving?,michael,2
19358,"We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us.",dwight,10
19359,We'll use code names.,andy,4
19360,"Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight.",dwight,11
19361,That's not different enough.,andy,4

19367,"Okay, calm down. I have a small problem.",michael,8
19369,"Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.",michael,42
19371,"I'm creative, Ryan.",michael,3
19373,"Well actually I can't cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike's Cereal Shack. I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.",michael,28
19375,Yeah!,michael,1
19377,"Are you? I don't think you're doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.",michael,16
19379,"Hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today.",michael,12
19381,"How about never hundred hours, sir.",michael,6
19384,Hey thanks. Thank you.,michael,4
19386,"Yeah, I'm glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again.",michael,12
19390,I'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it.,michael,9
19392,"Okay. [hangs up phone] And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way.",michael,16
19393,"Has anyone ever come up to you and said, 'You're not creative'?",michael,12
19394,Yes.,dwight,1
19395,"Well they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.",michael,34
19396,"Who are you talking to, specifically?",jim,6
19400,"We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So let's get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously.  Phyllis, I'd like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area.",michael,54
19402,"Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.",michael,54
19404,"Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-?",andy,15
19406,Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice?,andy,16
19410,Line it up Phyllis.,michael,4
19418,"Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought... I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.",michael,25
19420,"Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I'll make you a mix.",michael,18
19422,News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later.,andy,17
19423,Hey.,jim,1
19424,"No talk, I'm animating.",pam,4
19426,Are you serious?,pam,3
19427,Yeah.,jim,1
19428,"Oh my God, he's really in pain.",pam,7
19429,[sighs],jim,1
19430,Who's that?,pam,2
19431,"Oh, it's just my avatar guy. Whatever.",jim,7
19432,He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?,pam,14
19433,"Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so---",jim,8
19434,Right... you're a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too.,pam,10
19435,Yep.,jim,1
19436,You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.,pam,15
19437,I... why don't we go back to this animation.,jim,9
19438,"No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim.",pam,15
19439,"Ah, show me how this works.",jim,6
19440,Oh boy.,pam,2
19445,Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.,michael,16
19448,"No, I hate it! I hate it! ...I don't hate it, I just don't like it at all. And it's terrible.",michael,21
19450,"Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl.",michael,9
19452,"No. I said I hate the, the style.",michael,8
19453,[singing] Break me off a piece of that lumber tar. Snickers bar.,andy,12
19454,"Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible.",michael,7
19455,Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon.,andy,9
19456,"Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?",michael,41
19458,That'a girl.,michael,2
19460,"Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton?",michael,9
19462,"Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please? [Kevin hands her piece of tape]",michael,14
19463,"I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one.",jim,25
19464,"Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet.",pam,9
19465,Okay. Do you want me to stay?,jim,7
19466,"No no, you can go home. I'm good.",pam,8
19467,"Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.",jim,22
19469,"I, ah...",jim,2
19471,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.",pam,5
19472,"Good morning. [Pam sees breakfast sitting on her desk] Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.",jim,24
19473,Thank you.,pam,2
19474,You're welcome.,jim,2
19475,"I worked until about 2:45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide.",pam,59
19476,Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night.,andy,16
19477,"Andy, I can't hear this right now.",dwight,7
19479,She called you D?,dwight,4
19480,Yeah. D for Andy.,andy,4
19481,Oh D.,dwight,2
19482,Oh D.,andy,2
19483,[whispers] Oh D.,dwight,3
19484,Oh D!,andy,2
19486,I'm about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent. They'll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay. [dials phone],michael,25
19487,[on phone] Yes?,pam,3
19488,"Pam, please clear my phone lines.",michael,6
19489,"Certainly. [makes beeping noises] Okay, clear.",pam,6
19490,They could call at any second now. [sighs] Oh God...I better call.,michael,12
19491,"[Ten days later] Well, it's been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest!",michael,36
19494,"No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.",michael,35
19495,"Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?",jim,15
19496,"Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it.",jim,26
19499,Animation? All her by the way. [points at Pam],jim,9
19501,I just thought you should---,jim,5
19503,Thanks.,pam,1
19505,Ahh. [puts his arm around Pam],jim,6

19508,"[singing] Claude Van Damme, Hair for Men, poison gas, NutraSweet. [speaking] It's gotta rhyme with 'piece.' Fancy Feast! [sings] Break me off a piece of that Fancy Feast! It's the cat food. Nailed it.",andy,34
19509,"All right! So, anybody else? No bad ideas. Everybody, let's keep 'em coming... oh, God.  Okay, Toby?",michael,18
19511,"There are no bad ideas but for an idea, that was really, really bad.",michael,14
19514,Yeah.,pam,1
19515,About dressing your best today?,michael,5
19516,"Yeah, I distribute so I get all the memos.",pam,9
19517,"Cool. Cool, I just wanted to make sure you got it.",michael,11
19518,"Yeah, I get all the memos. [starts to leave]",pam,9
19519,"Okay, good. Good.",michael,3
19523,"And if not we can just make him disappear. [walks quickly over to Jim's desk] This is Jim! Halpert. Jim has a very expressive face, don't you Jim? He is like our Mr. Bean.",michael,34
19524,Okay.,jim,1
19525,"So do, um, do sad, do the sad face.",michael,9
19526,I don't want -,jim,4
19527,"No, that's skeptical. Do sad.",michael,5
19528,Mmm...,jim,1
19529,"That's, that's a pirate movie. [Jim stares at Michael] That's annoyed. Well, he doesn't do very well under pressure.",michael,19
19531,"And anybody else, we can just hire an actor to replace.  Follow me!  Let's get this movin'. [Dwight goes back to his seat, embarrassed]",michael,26
19532,"All right, let's start.",michael,4
19533,"All right!  [sitting down behind Michael's desk] I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing, but...",jim,18
19534,"You are my producer, you are a suit.  I am the creative genius.  You take care of all the boring stuff, and let my mind just run free.",michael,30
19535,Yup.,jim,1
19536,"Now, we have eighty-five dollars, and a Sam Goody gift certificate...",michael,11
19537,Right.,jim,1
19538,...and we need to be done by 9 A.M. tomorrow.,michael,10
19539,Mmmhmm.  Why don't you start by telling me what you got.,jim,12
19540,We start on a single blank sheet of paper.,michael,9
19541,Love it.,jim,2
19542,And we widen to reveal ancient Rome.,michael,7
19543,"Mm, can't do that.",jim,4
19544,"Okay, we widen to reveal a spaceship blasting out of a woman's womb.",michael,13
19545,Definitely can't do that.,jim,4
19546,Bull[censored] man!,michael,2
19547,You know what?,jim,3
19548,This is bull[censored]!,michael,3
19549,"Okay, Scott, why don't you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial.",jim,25
19550,Ahhhh!  [sweeps toys off his desk],michael,7
19551,"I'm just doing my job, man.",jim,6
19552,"If you don't let me pursue my artistic vision, I am going to walk!",michael,14
19553,Good!  Fine!  I've got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee... [dialing phone],jim,20
19554,"No!  No!  Jim, Jim, don't, don't...",michael,8
19555,What?  What?,jim,3
19556,"No, I can do it.",michael,5
19557,What?,jim,1
19558,"I can do it good.  I can do it good.  Please, don't.  Please.  [kneels in front of desk] Please give me it.",michael,26
19559,"Okay, make a commercial.",jim,4
19560,[taps on desk and starts to leave his office] Do you want this open or closed?,michael,16
19561,"Closed. [Michael leaves his office, gives Jim two thumbs up, which Jim returns]",jim,13
19562,"Hey, everybody, I just got off the phone with David Wallace, and he has given us the go-ahead to make the first ever Dunder Mifflin television commercial.  Huh?",michael,29
19564,I can't hear you! [less applause]  Heard you a little bit less that time.  Must be...,michael,18
19565,We had already applauded.,dwight,4
19566,"Okay, okay.  Who could do music?",michael,7
19567,How about Darryl?,pam,3
19568,"Actually, I'm a little concerned about having a black person do the music, because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a... celestine prophesy, and keep the next Bon Jovi from ever picking up a piano.",michael,39
19569,"Michael is on a mission to prove that he's creative.  Which I think is odd, because Michael actually might be the most creative person I've ever known.  Every day, Michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before.",jim,45
19577,This is perfect.,michael,3
19578,He looks like your twin.,dwight,5
19579,"This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door.  When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring.  Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone.",michael,59
19580,I will know.,dwight,3
19581,"But, you will not tell anyone.",michael,6
19582,I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky.  Yeah.,dwight,12
19585,"Just go out, and come back in.",michael,7
19587,What?,michael,1
19588,"Hey everyone, can I have your attention please?  I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there.",michael,41
19590,"No, no, no, no, no-no, no no.  You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing.  Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her.",michael,32
19591,"Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.",jim,8
19592,"Okay, smarty pants, then why?  Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?",michael,15
19594,That could not possibly be it.,michael,6
19596,How can I get you to stay?,michael,7
19598,"Yeah we all want money.  But there is none in the budget, so... Tell me why you're really leaving.",michael,20

19607,"Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club.  We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way.  Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful.  There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed.  It's very exclusive.",pam,57
19609,So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?,jim,12
19610,Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.,pam,13

19622,"Yes, listen, um...  You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this.",michael,13
19624,"No, his work family.  Look, this is very hard for me, but I'm going to give you my best man.  You may have Toby.",michael,26
19626,"You can train him.  He's very very smart, and funny, and charming... You know, I can't do it, Toby is the worst.  That- that was a bluff, um...  Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I'm going to poach one of yours.",michael,49
19628,"Okay, good-bye.  Wait!  Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?  Your best one?  [Karen hangs up]",michael,25

19635,"[to Pam] Get out. [to Ben] Uh, yeah.  I also saved her life, but I guess that's not as grabby.",michael,21
19637,"No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say?",michael,13
19639,"What is that guy talking about?  Scranton is not lame.  Scranton is the cool, fun branch.  We're like Animal House.",michael,23
19640,Found him!,dwight,2

19642,So what are you going to do?,jim,7
19643,"What are we going to do?  We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do.  Corcroan dropped Staples.",michael,25
19644,Did they?,jim,2
19645,"Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it.  You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale.  We're going to prove, what the hell is that music?",michael,44
19646,"It's Vivaldi, for Finer Things.",pam,5
19647,"That's the problem, that's the problem.  We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll.  Alright? [sees Toby in a bow-tie holding a plate full of tea cups] Oh... My... God, that's why people are leaving.  I- I have no words.",michael,44
19648,We just passed the exit for Corcroan.,jim,7
19649,What? What? We did?,michael,4

19679,Okay.,jim,1
19680,"Hey Dwight, he found it.",michael,5

19684,Do you really wanna know?,michael,5
19685,"Oh, God. [hangs up phone]",jim,5
19686,"Follow me, come here.  Here's what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse.  I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.",michael,31

19696,Teach her to offer Stanley more money.,michael,7
19697,"So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume.  And a moustache.",jim,18
19698,"So, why did you and Karen break up?  Was it the sex?",michael,13
19699,What?,jim,1
19700,"I can't imagine the sex being bad, I mean her body is...",michael,12
19701,"Okay, you know what?",jim,4
19702,...awesome.,michael,1
19703,Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?,jim,12

19947,Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours.,michael,16
19948,"Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?",jim,15
19949,"Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me.",michael,29
19950,"OK, great.",jim,2
19951,"This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I.",michael,21
19952,Yup.,jim,1
19953,"When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being.",michael,12
19954,That'd be great.,jim,3
19955,"Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way: no, I do not.",dwight,23
19957,"No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.",dwight,12
19958,"Well, yes I would. And I would survive.",michael,8
19959,I would make sure that you were dead.,dwight,8
19960,Well...,michael,1
19961,"First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.",dwight,17
19962,You...,michael,1
19963,And they would call me the Overkill Killer.,dwight,8
19964,You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real. [blindfolds eyes with tie] OK.,michael,17
19965,What are you doing?,dwight,4
19966,"I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been--- [Dwight whacks Michael with his shoe] Ow! What are you doing?",michael,39
19967,It would be better if you were unconscious.,dwight,8
19968,"No! Gosh! Dwight. [Dwight tries to hit Michael with his shoe again] Stop it, stop it! Stop it.",michael,18
19969,Do you want to do this right or not?,dwight,9
19970,"Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?",michael,12
19972,"Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday?",jim,6
19974,"I do remember, yeah.",jim,4
19976,"You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?",jim,16
19978,"There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.",jim,44
19979,[flashback to Stanley's birthday] Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug.,michael,15
19980,"And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to 'Happy Birthday.' And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.",jim,37
19981,"[flashback to Kelly's birthday, hiding in the elevator] Happy Birthday!",michael,10
19983,"[flashback to Oscar's birthday, hiding in the break room] Happy Birthday!",michael,11
19985,"[flashback to Phyllis' birthday, sneaking up on Phyllis' car] Happy Birthday!",michael,11
19987,"So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.",jim,15
19988,"We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time.",jim,14
19990,"Wow! You're shaking things up a bit, huh?",pam,8
19991,"It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?",jim,8
19992,Do you think it's a good idea?,pam,7
19993,No... I think it's a great idea.,jim,7
19994,[smiles] Hmm.,pam,2
19995,We're here. [gets out of the car],dwight,7
19996,Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.,michael,22
19997,[leading Michael from car] Here we go. Just the two of us [gestures for camera crew to follow],dwight,18
19998,"Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?",dwight,16
19999,"Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets [leads Michael into some tall grass] Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it.",dwight,24
20000,"You know, try sending them another invoice.",jim,7
20002,"Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way?",jim,15
20004,Right? I was just thinking...,jim,5
20006,Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes],jim,20
20007,Good a spot as any. [They stop and Dwight starts spinning Michael around in circles],dwight,15
20008,"What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just --",michael,9
20009,I'm just --,dwight,3
20010,Stop.,michael,1
20011,Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction. [stops spinning and takes Michael's blindfold off] Behold.,dwight,17
20012,"Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight.",michael,5
20013,Here's your knife. Here's your duct tape.,dwight,7
20014,"Alright, very good. Ahh, OK. [Dwight gives Michael a hug]",michael,10
20015,"Good luck, Michael.",dwight,3
20016,"Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight. [Dwight runs off]",michael,12
20018,What's that?,jim,2
20020,"Oh, sure.",jim,2
20022,OK. [Meredith leaves],jim,3
20023,Wow! That was easy.,pam,4
20024,"Yeah, people like me I guess.",jim,6
20027,Well I think Meredith was just --,jim,7
20029,Everybody's birthday.,jim,2
20031,What do you want?,jim,4
20033,You want a birthday pie?,jim,5
20035,"Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie.",jim,18
20037,It will be Angela.,jim,4
20040,"I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity.",dwight,53
20041,"There we go. [standing with short sleeves and short pants] Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts [ties jacket around neck].",michael,37
20042,I'm going to wear what was once one of my pant legs. [puts pant leg on head like a hat],michael,20
20043,"See, this is a beautiful piece of material [rips other pant leg in half] This could be used for all sorts of things.",michael,23
20044,Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable.,michael,11
20045,Tuna. [rolls in chair to Jim's desk],andy,7
20046,Andy.,jim,1
20047,"Me likey the ice cream cake, okay? Fudgie the Whale.",andy,10
20048,Not your birthday.,jim,3
20049,"Well, I'm just saying, you know, if you want to make people happy, namely me, you will have a Fudgie the Whale.",andy,22
20050,"Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no.",jim,9
20051,"Wow, OK, harsh. Just don't expect me to show up.",andy,10
20052,"Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.",jim,8
20053,Loud and clear. [rolls in chair back to desk],andy,9
20054,Alright. [Andy rolls back],jim,4
20055,Pizza rolls.,andy,2
20056,"OK, I'm gonna go into this office here [gets up and walks into Michael's office] to do some work. So I will be in here.",jim,25
20057,Mushroom caps.,andy,2
20058,"I am totally alone right now, with only my thoughts. I love it. I'm loving it. I can literally say anything I want. No one is gonna here me. [screams] Wish I could have gone with Ryan on that cool retreat! Jan has plastic boobs! I HAVE HEMORRHOIDS! Doesn't even matter.",michael,51
20059,Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. [pulls a nest from a tree] I hope he finds it. [picks up some bird eggs] Lunch.,dwight,35
20060,"Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious.",michael,52
20061,About two more minutes [cooking bird eggs].,dwight,7
20072,"Hey guys, what're we talking about?",jim,6
20074,"Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy [pats a large tree trunk] may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day.",michael,36
20075,Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... [clicks rifle into safety mode] on.,dwight,16
20077,Toby.,jim,1
20079,"Oh, thanks man.",jim,3
20081,Is there anything --,jim,4
20083,"Oh, OK.",jim,2
20085,What?,jim,1
20087,I remember that.,jim,3
20089,Seriously?,jim,1
20091,"Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon.",jim,30
20092,"OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?",jim,16
20095,"That's a bummer. OK, then we need to...[steps outside office] Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please?  'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.",jim,32
20096,[raises hand] Conference room?,pam,4
20097,"Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it.",jim,45
20102,"Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.",jim,16
20103,"Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those [points camera to mushrooms] are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well. [puts them in mouth]",michael,37
20104,"Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! [runs up to Michael and knocks him over] Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out. [picks out mushrooms from Michael's mouth]",dwight,26
20106,"Yeah! [everybody clapping] Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want -- OK, alright. Yeah, don't do that. You're gonna break something.",michael,25
20108,"Hey, buddy.",michael,2
20109,Hey.,jim,1
20110,What up?,michael,2
20111,Sure glad you're back.,jim,4
20112,You are relieved.,michael,3
20113,You have no idea.,jim,4
20114,So what did I miss?,michael,5
20115,"Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.",jim,11
20116,Oh.,michael,1
20117,"So, terrible idea.",jim,3
20118,"Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake.",michael,7
20119,You did do it?,jim,4
20120,"Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out.",michael,11
20121,"Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.",jim,10
20122,That's what I said. That's what she said.,michael,8
20123,That's what who said?,jim,4
20124,"I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard.",michael,24
20125,That's what she said.,jim,4
20126,"Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward.",michael,8
20127,Come in!,michael,2
20128,"Oh, it's Creed's birthday today.  Should we get him an ice-cream cake?  Mint chocolate chip?",pam,17
20129,"Pam, are you my friend?",michael,5
20130,"Oh, no.",pam,2
20131,"We have been friends forever, right?",michael,6
20132,"Yes, I have been working with you forever.",pam,8
20133,"Hypothetically... would you go camping with me, if I were to ask you?  And bear in mind that I would never actually ask you to go camping.  That Jim is also a friend of mine, and I would rather die than make any sort of improper ovation toward you.",michael,51
20134,I don't think so.,pam,4
20135,"Here's the thing.  When Michael invents a hypothetical situation, he eventually turns it into an actual situation.",pam,18
20136,"Do you understand that Jim is like a brother to me, and I would never do anything inappropriate?",michael,18
20137,I do.,pam,2
20138,"So, as friends, would you go with me on a camping trip?",michael,12
20139,No.,pam,1
20140,Thank you for your honesty.,michael,5
20141,You're welcome.  Open or closed?,pam,6
20142,"Split the difference.  Hey... mint chocolate chip, please?  Is Jim out there?",michael,14
20143,No.,pam,1
20144,Can you send Dwight in here?,michael,6
20145,"Yeah.  Dwight, Michael wants to see you in his office. [Dwight runs in]",pam,14
20146,You wanted to see me?,dwight,5
20147,"Mmhmm.  I had something very personal I would like to discuss. [Dwight closes door, takes off glasses, kneels in front of Michael's desk]  Would you go find Jim, and send him in here, please?",michael,36
20148,I'm on it.,dwight,3
20149,Michael has employed Dwight to track you down.,pam,8
20150,How much time do I have?,jim,6
20151,"Jim, Michael's office.",dwight,3
20152,"Couple minutes, give or take.",pam,5
20153,"Now, Jim!",dwight,2
20154,"And this... is a Hassenfass.  Case-hardened steel.  One side, as sharp as you'd ever want something to be.  The other side serrated for maximum damage.",dwight,28
20155,Okay.,michael,1
20156,Look at that.  Perfectly balanced.  This is a fine precision instrument.,dwight,13
20157,"All right, Dexter, just give me the knife.",michael,8
20158,Don't you want a sheath for that?,dwight,7
20159,"No, just get me a case. [Dwight looks at the camera, lifts his leg onto the desk, removes the sheath from his ankle, and gives it to Michael]  All right.",michael,31
20160,Anything else?  Flint...,dwight,4
20161,MmMmm.  All I need...,michael,5
20162,Parka...,dwight,1
20163,"No, Dwight!",michael,2
20164,"Tent, rainfly, gorp...",dwight,3
20165,"I'm telling you, all I will need are my instincts and my will to survive.",michael,15
20166,Mmmnnnnmmm...,dwight,1
20167,[holding up knife] What is this called again?,michael,8
20169,I'll call back.,michael,3
20171,"Every time Michael's in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a Post-It note telling him who's on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is he doesn't get that many calls. So he has me make them up every 10 minutes.",pam,55
20172,"[Pam walks in and shows Michael a note that says 'Good Morning'] Yeah, um, tell him I'll call him back.",michael,20
20174,You can't always work 200 days though.,michael,7
20175,"[Pam walks in and shows Michael a note that has a smiley face] Oh, no, no, no, I don't have time for this. Tell him I'm in a meeting. [Jan looks impressed]",michael,32
20177,Yep.,michael,1
20179,"Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later.",michael,29
20181,"N-No, money isn't everything Ryan. And you're my friend, and I don't want to be rude.",michael,16
20183,"I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist.",michael,8
20185,"Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through? [Pam pushes a button the phone] Hi buddy.",michael,19
20187,"Yeah, I hate that.",michael,4
20189,"So, here's the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs.",michael,36
20191,"Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? I'm feeling a little queasy.",michael,29
20193,Well-,michael,1
20195,Disray .My friend Disray got news specs. Disray spect. My friend Inappro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor.,michael,19
20197,Yep. Tell them how much you're gonna get if you win.,michael,11
20199,Million dollars!,michael,2
20201,"Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like it's not memorized.",michael,44
20203,Perfect crime.,michael,2
20205,"Could we please pull over and pull down the top, I do not feel good.",michael,15
20207,"I'm getting car sick! Ugh, I'm gonna puke. I think I'm gonna throw up.",michael,14
20209,"Hey, Schneider, real quick. What do you call a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff?",michael,17
20211,"Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus. [To Jan] Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is.",michael,21
20213,Hey hey.,michael,2
20216,I would love that.,michael,4
20218,Abso-fruitley. Yeah. I'll-I'll do anything for the company.,michael,8
20220,It is.,michael,2
20222,"All right, let's run it back.",jim,6
20223,The warehouse got a ping pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12.,pam,26
20225,"Hi, Kelly.",pam,2
20227,I don't wanna guess.,pam,4
20230,Jim. Can I see you for a second?,pam,8
20231,Sure.,jim,1
20232,Wow.,jim,1
20233,"Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and beat Darryl.",pam,21
20234,"Oh, I can't beat Darryl.",jim,5
20235,Please? Kelly's trash talking me because Darryl is beating you.,pam,10
20236,"What, seriously? What is she saying?",jim,6
20240,So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?,jim,10
20241,"Sorta, yes.",pam,2
20242,Bring me players.,jim,3
20243,Okay.,pam,1
20245,"Hi. [Michael sees Toby] No, no, absolutely not. What is he doing here?",michael,13
20247,"Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition?",michael,9
20249,Never. I want him gone. I don't talk until he leaves.,michael,11
20252,Okay. All right.,michael,3
20254,Yessh.,michael,1
20256,"Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.",michael,15
20259,"Hey, Kevin. Jim needs to see you.",pam,7
20261,He needs help balancing some travel receipts.,pam,7
20263,"Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room.",pam,12
20266,"I haven't actually seen it. But I have seen the firm, and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief",michael,20
20268,Six years and two months.,michael,5
20270,That's what she said.,michael,4
20272,That's what she said.,michael,4
20274,"Uh, wh-why would she say that?",michael,6
20278,Come again? That's what she said? I don't know what you're talking about.,michael,13
20284,"Well, delivery is all wrong. She's butchering it.",michael,8
20287,She thought it had to do with the twins. That's what I call them.,michael,14
20289,"Um, to be delicate, they hang off milady's chest. They... make milk.",michael,12
20291,Yes.,michael,1
20293,"Yes, and frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant.",michael,10
20295,"Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules.",michael,12
20297,"Because before we started dating, we disclosed our relationship to HR. And I have the proof right here. [makes a gasping sound]",michael,22
20299,I will allow it.,michael,4
20301,Uh...,michael,1
20303,Uh-huh.,michael,1
20305,"Ugh. Well, de-depends on how you define 'begin'. I mean, if it was from the first time we shook hands, that's like six years ago. If it's from the first time we kissed, that's like two years ago.",michael,38
20307,"If it was the first time we kissed sober, it was like four months after that.",michael,16
20310,Line.,michael,1
20314,Good game Meredith.,jim,3
20316,All right! What is going on here?,dwight,7
20317,"Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?",jim,41
20318,"[Dwight and Jim are playing ping-pong, and Dwight scores] What the hell?",jim,12
20319,I told you.,dwight,3
20320,"All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, J'rg Ro'kopf,  and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba.",dwight,54
20321,"Jan and I had an off again, on again relationship for two years. And I know this destroys her case, and I am sorry, but I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition.",michael,34

20326,Irie.,michael,1
20329,I don't think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary.,michael,14
20334,"[looking for a place to sit, goes to Toby's table] Can I sit here?",michael,14
20336,How can you give up my diary like that?,michael,9
20338,How'd you even find it?,michael,5
20340,I don't like lump. I'm really upset about this.,michael,9
20342,Fine. I love you.,michael,4
20345,"Not a woman, just a cool, great looking, best friend.",michael,10
20348,"Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had sex with Jan, and yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly didn't consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful.",michael,41
20350,Thank you very much. You didn't have to say that.,michael,10
20352,"That was before our relationship. She was going through a divorce, and she was drinking a lot... [Jan glares at Michael] ...of water.",michael,23
20354,March 17th.,michael,2
20356,Yes.,michael,1
20358,"[reading the performance review] 'I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks. Mr. Scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee, and a poor branch manager. I recommend he be removed from that position and re-assigned to sales where he belongs.'",michael,47

20396,Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?,jim,10
20399,"Oh, hey no biggie. Just...",michael,5
20401,"[nods and shakes hands with David Wallace] Hey, David?",michael,9
20403,I think you're a nice guy too.,michael,7
20405,"Why did I do it? I don't know. Jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary. But she already brought the diary with her to New York, so... You expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend.",michael,52
20406,[Driving with Jan in the car] What do you want to do for dinner?,michael,14
20408,Sure trying to save some money... get something cheap.,michael,9
20410,Do you fast food?,michael,4
20412,"So, where did you learn how to play?",jim,8
20414,"My friend's basement. All right, ready to start?",jim,8
20416,What are you doing?,jim,4
20419,"Right. There, first...",jim,3
20421,I think that's the question that you had...,jim,8
20422,What are you doing?,pam,4
20424,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [makes 'talking' gesture with her hand]  Jim, come on, we gotta get in there and practice.  Okay?  I'm not kidding!",pam,28
20425,Wow. [heads toward the conference room],jim,6
20426,Now.  Get good work done.  Concentrate.,pam,8
20427,All right.,jim,2
20428,On your backhand. [Jim opens the conference room door and enters],pam,11
20434,What are you guys doing?,jim,5
20436,"Oh yeah, how long's this meeting going to last?  [Stanley mumbles, looking at his watch]",jim,16
20438,I played a lot of pong growing up.  I spent a lot of time on cruise ships.  I'm also a monster snorkler.,andy,24
20439,"Okay, you know what, this table's not regulation.",andy,8
20440,Good eye - it's an oval.  [Andy compares his arm length to his side of the conference table] You're measuring the table.,jim,23
20441,Do you know anything about physics?,andy,6
20442,Do you?,jim,2
20443,"Just serve.  Let's go. [hits one into net]  Dammit!  These balls are weighted weird, aren't they?",andy,19
20444,Yup.,jim,1
20445,"Yeah.  Get another one. [throws the offending ball at Jim, who takes another from his pocket]",andy,17
20446,"Now, wait a minute.  You're not gonna punch a wall, or me, or anything like that if you don't win the point, are you?",jim,25
20447,"I don't know! No, okay, just... serve!",andy,7
20448,"I have some, uh, experience.  I, um, once had to testify in a traffic accident case.",michael,17
20450,"Yes.  My testimony was actually very important, um, because the accident was my fault.  [To Toby] Tell Meredith I said it another time [Toby nods].",michael,27
20452,"Before we continue, I would like to make an opening statement.",michael,11
20456,"Na, Na-oh, Naa-es.",michael,3
20458,Ye-ohh.  Ye-no.,michael,3
20460,Very nice! [Borat voice],michael,4
20462,High five! [Borat voice],michael,4
20465,[shakes head] Can't stop.,michael,4
20467,Forgot normal talk.,michael,3
20470,"Nobody likes to work late, least of all me. [to Jim] Do you have plans tonight?",michael,16
20471,"Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working.",jim,15
20473,Thank you Michael.,dwight,3
20474,"All right, happy Friday. [to Jim] Well I think we dodged a bullet there.",michael,14
20475,I think you did.,jim,4
20476,"I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?",michael,16
20477,"Oh, I-",jim,2
20478,You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said.,michael,10
20479,"Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.",jim,45
20480,"Michael, what time should I be arriving?",dwight,7
20481,"Dwight, it's couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy.",michael,27
20482,Hey-o!,andy,1
20483,Does it bother me that I wasn't invited to Michael's dinner party? [breaks down crying],dwight,15
20485,Hello.,michael,1
20486,Hi.,jim,1
20488,Come on in. Good to see you.,michael,7
20490,"Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?",michael,9
20491,"Let's see, since I saw you an hour ago?",jim,9
20492,Yeah.,michael,1
20493,I have been getting ready and then driving over here.,jim,10
20494,Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing.,michael,10
20495,Really?,jim,1
20496,Except driving.,michael,2
20497,We got you this. [gives a bottle of wine],pam,9
20499,"Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I don't know, make yourself to home. This is our casa.",michael,20
20500,It's really nice.,pam,3
20502,"Tour, let's do the tour first.",jim,6
20503,Okay.,michael,1
20505,Totally your call babe.,michael,4
20507,"Oh, you guys doing a little construction?",jim,7
20508,"Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door.",michael,7
20510,"Well, thats...",michael,2
20512,"Yep, never been used.",michael,4
20514,No.,michael,1
20516,"This is it, check that out, can you smell that? [the room is filled with candles that say 'Serenity by Jan']",michael,21
20517,Uh-huh.,pam,1
20518,As you can smell there's a lot of different odors going on in here.,michael,14
20519,So you have an office and a workspace?,pam,8
20521,It's fire.,jim,2
20523,Bond.,michael,1
20525,"James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn. [clicks tongue]",michael,14

20532,"Well, I-",michael,2
20534,What a cute bench.,pam,4
20535,"Thanks, that's my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy.",michael,16
20536,Really? 'cause... seems pretty narrow... and short.,jim,7
20537,It's actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this. [Lies down],michael,13
20539,"I finally broke down and bought myself a plasma TV. Check it out. [reveals a tiny TV] I actually hung this on the wall myself. I want to show you something . A lot of people in the room, need more space? [moves TV back a couple inches] Voila, right in the wall.",michael,53
20540,Wow.,jim,1
20541,"Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table.",michael,25
20542,What is that chestnut?,jim,4
20543,"No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.",michael,10
20545,"Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool.",jim,12
20547,"Yeah, he tried to set up my TIVO for me but then I didn't have audio for a week.",pam,19
20548,"If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away.",michael,13
20550,"Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.",jim,20
20552,"Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies.",michael,13
20554,I'll get it.,michael,3
20557,Okay.,michael,1
20558,"Tuna! What's up Tuna, we having tuna for dinner? [to Pam] I bet you're sick of tuna right? You probably have tuna every night. Tuna! [to Jan] These are for you. [hands flowers]",andy,33
20560,Very nice.,michael,2
20561,"Except for one flower, which is for... my flower.",andy,9
20565,Oh I can help starting dinner if you need it.,pam,10
20567,Three hours from now or three hours from earlier like 4:00?,pam,11
20569,When in Rome.,michael,3
20571,Whatever you say babe.,michael,4
20573,All right.,michael,2
20574,How 'bout a toast. Shall I? Here's to good friends.,michael,10
20576,Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth.,michael,5
20577,What was that?,jim,3
20579,Yeah that sounds good.,michael,4
20582,"You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him.",michael,14
20585,"[To camera] I don't care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for... at a dinner party.",pam,26
20586,[playing charades] No it's a... hump. There's a hump.,andy,9
20588,"Okay yes, first name of that animal and the second name is the state where Helena is the capital.",andy,19
20589,Montana.,pam,1
20591,Joe Montana!,pam,2
20592,Yes! Yes.,andy,2
20593,Why didn't you just say 49ers quarterback?,pam,7
20594,"All right, [rhythim clapping] my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn.",michael,19
20596,"What, no, I'm just making people laugh.",michael,7
20598,"Yes, I was watching Jim's face.",michael,6
20600,And he was laughing.,michael,4
20602,"Look at him, he's laughing.",michael,5
20603,Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it. [holds cellphone],jim,38
20604,"You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.",jim,29
20605,Oh okay.,pam,2
20606,Well you don't need two of you to do that.,michael,10
20607,"That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much.",jim,16
20608,"Oh Jim, I don't think you're going to abandon this party here all by itself.",pam,15
20609,I don't know because I everything I own is there.,jim,10
20610,You can buy new stuff but you can't buy a new party.,pam,12
20611,"That's true, that's a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right.",michael,34
20612,"Michael, you're up.",andy,3
20613,"All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom-",michael,18
20615,"All right, Okay, okay, you're getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE.",michael,25
20617,Katie Holmes.,jim,2
20618,"No, Baah! But he's married to her!",michael,7
20619,"Oh, Dawson's Creek.",jim,3
20620,"No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, I'm gonna pass, I'm gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger.",michael,25
20622,Not really a rhyme.,jim,4
20624,"Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator.",michael,11
20626,Tom Cruise!,jim,2
20627,No!,michael,1
20628,Time!,andy,1
20629,"God, does anybody read the paper?!",michael,6
20630,"[Michael offers his coat to Pam, who is shivering] Oh, thank you.",pam,12
20631,You're welcome.,michael,2
20633,I don't like that story babe.,michael,6
20635,"Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.",michael,43
20637,"Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! I'm in hell! Aaahhh I'm burning, help me!",michael,18
20639,Is there more wine in the kitchen?,pam,7
20644,"No, yeah. What?",pam,3
20646,"Oh, are you joking?",pam,4
20648,"I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever.",pam,25
20651,[in the garage] So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand [the chairs are shaped like hands]. So Jim I noticed you checking out Jan's candles.,michael,30
20652,Oh no she just put it in front of my face.,jim,11
20653,"Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of 'Serenity by Jan' What do you think about that?",michael,42
20654,"Thought about it, I'm in.",andy,5
20655,"I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company?",jim,14
20656,I'm sorry. [doorbell rings] What now?,michael,6
20658,Hello.,dwight,1
20660,"We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?",dwight,15
20661,[whispering] Awesome.,pam,2
20664,Dwight is my friend.,michael,4
20666,"You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person.",michael,30
20668,"Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?",michael,24
20672,Do you mean it? You want to have a kid? [Jan walks away],michael,13
20674,So can we come in?,dwight,5
20675,Hmmm... Mmm... great turkey leg.,dwight,5
20677,"Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?",dwight,9
20680,Hey hey hey hey. [to Angela] I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times.,dwight,19
20682,[leans across to Pam whispering] Pam... I hope she didn't do anything to the food.,michael,15
20683,[whispers] Like... like what?,pam,4
20684,"I can't prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me. [Jan serves the food] Hey, looks great babe.",michael,22
20685,Yeah it does.,andy,3
20686,I know Jan didn't poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover?,pam,31
20688,"You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?",michael,11
20690,Excuse me for a second. [gets up from the table],michael,10
20691,[to babysitter] So... how do you guys know each other?,jim,10
20693,And now you guys are dating?,pam,6
20694,Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.,dwight,9
20695,Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...,jim,13
20697,Nevermind.,jim,1
20698,Ok... alright... here we go. [takes down huge painting behind his seat and puts up a neon beer sign] There. [plugs it in] Oooookay.,michael,24
20699,That's nice.,jim,2
20700,Everybody enjoying their meal?,michael,4
20702,Yeah?,michael,1
20704,No. No. I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.,michael,15
20706,[to the guests] Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good.,michael,18
20708,BFD. I'm a screenwriter.,michael,4
20710,NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS!,michael,16
20712,MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES!,michael,8
20714,OH GOOD. I'LL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER!,michael,7
20716,"[yells] THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! [Jan gets an evil look on her face and picks up Michael's dundie and throws it into his plasma screen tv] THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe! [Jan goes upstairs crying.]",michael,56
20718,Fine. Get outta here.,dwight,4
20719,It's getting late.,jim,3
20720,"You know what guys, she'll be out of the bathroom soon.",michael,11
20721,[Jim and Pam head out the door and there are policemen at the door] Of course,jim,16
20722,"Get out of my way, I'll take care of this. OK.[to police] Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?",dwight,20
20724,Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.,michael,15
20726,Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.,michael,17
20728,Would she get into trouble?,michael,5
20730,I will take the fall. I did it.,michael,8
20734,[puts his hand on the Officer's shoulder] Michael can come home with me.,dwight,13
20735,Jim? Pam?,michael,2
20736,Oh... my apartment's on fire,jim,5
20737,[whispers] Flooded.,pam,2
20738,Flooded.,jim,1
20739,You people. [to Michael] Come on. You're sleeping with me.,dwight,10
20740,No.,michael,1
20741,I'm gonna take you home Michael.,dwight,6
20742,Nope.,michael,1
20743,Alright. [leads Michael away],dwight,4
20745,"[Pam and Jim are sitting in Jim's car in front of Detroit Coney Island Chili Dogs] This is the best burger I've ever had, babe.",pam,25
20746,"You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad.",jim,13
20747,Hmm?,pam,1
20748,[holds up Hunter's CD] I stole this. [Pam laughs] For you babe.,jim,12
20749,"[Hunter's voice starts singing, Pam joins in] One night...",pam,9
20753,"[to Jim, quietly] Food!",pam,4
20755,I believe it means mouth pleaser.,andy,6
20757,"It's French.  I studied some French during my semester at sea.  Or, shall I say a semester at la mer, which is French for 'sea.'",andy,27
20759,"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.",andy,2
20762,"Yes, I did, for you, princess.  Even though I only went number one. [quietly to Jim] I didn't really wash my hands.  Ohhh, what have we here?  This looks delicious. [picks up amuse-bouche tray]",michael,37
20763,[quietly] Not with your hands.,pam,5
20764,[touching and moving each amuse-bouche] They need to be presented... royally... anyone?,michael,12
20765,Mmm. [takes one and eats it],andy,6
20766,Good stuff.  All right.   Let's get down to some wine drinking.,michael,14
20767,"Oh, my God, [eating a bar in the hallway] I thought I was gonna pass out.  [Jim takes it from her and takes a bite]",pam,26
20768,We should probably get back.,jim,5
20769,"Mmm-mm.  I'm probably just gonna stay here for a while, say I got lost.",pam,15
20771,It was just a little...,pam,5
20772,"I didn't have anything, Jan.",jim,5
20774,"I'm sorry.  She scares me. [walks away, Pam keeps eating]",jim,11
20775,"Michael's dinner party is for couples only, which is why I wasn't initially invited.  But that was then.  I very recently entered into a serious, monogamous relationship.  [looking around] If that idiot ever gets here.",dwight,38
20777,Where did you grow up?,pam,5
20778,It's been a rough couple of weeks.,michael,7
20780,"Little trouble.  Yes.  Well, Jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift.",michael,14
20781,"Wow, you did neighborhood watch?",pam,5
20782,Yes.,michael,1
20784,"So she's passed out, and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors' dog...",michael,15
20786,And the neighbors blamed Jan.,michael,5
20788,"It's like, you know, the dog shouldn't have been outside in the first place.  Anyway, it's a tragedy, really, because the paint is not gonna come off the dog until it sheds...",michael,33
20790,So...,michael,1
20792,Well.,michael,1
20794,What's that?,jim,2
20799,W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get.,pam,22
20800,So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.,jim,12
20801,Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim.,pam,19
20802,"Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.",jim,15
20803,Nature.,pam,1
20805,"I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar.",andy,9
20807,Some of us like the walk more than others.,pam,9
20809,[to Michael who is looking at a chair catalog] Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile.,pam,18
20810,"Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair.",michael,19
20811,"But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair.",pam,14
20812,"Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care, but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these. [makes a shrrhhh sound of a chair moving downward as Pam slumps down] I really want it.",pam,49
20813,[holding up the catalog] Have you ever seen this woman?,michael,10
20814,Her?,pam,1
20815,Hmm...,michael,1
20816,The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?,pam,11
20817,"Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She's got - I don't know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.",michael,43
20818,Or in a great chair.,pam,5
20819,"Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women?",michael,18
20820,I definitely remember your dinner party.,pam,6
20821,I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman. [whispers] Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.,michael,26
20822,"Actually, I put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair.",pam,17
20823,What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.,michael,38
20824,"Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85. [phone rings]",michael,18
20826,"[on phone] No, he hasn't picked one yet.",pam,8
20829,"I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all.",michael,43
20830,I left my cell phone in my car.,andy,8
20832,"[to Kevin] Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up?",michael,15
20834,I thought that you were engaged?,michael,6
20836,"Whaaaat? God, that's terrible man. Eghh, she's crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends?",michael,20
20838,Oh...,michael,1
20840,Yeah... ugh. She's... [gets up and leaves] you don't deserve her. Alright.,michael,12
20841,"[sitting on Oscar's desk] Oh hello Oscar Mayer Weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you'd never touch 'em, because of your condition. Umm...",michael,39
20843,What?,michael,1
20845,Oh.,michael,1
20847,"Hmm, I see, feisty. So she's not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?",michael,17
20849,Oooo. Catcher or in field?,michael,5
20851,"Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?",michael,22
20853,I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing? [silence] It bothers me that you're not answering the question.,michael,29
20855,"Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK!",michael,10
20856,What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry.,michael,20
20857,"Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes.",michael,41

20861,"Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot.",andy,17
20862,Hmm..,michael,1
20863,It's like a ten minute walk.,andy,6
20865,"Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so... Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one. [thinks] OK, yes that would be bad.",michael,38
20867,Yes.,andy,1
20868,That would be bad.,michael,4
20869,OK.,andy,1
20871,...So help us out.,andy,4
20872,"Wish I could, but I can't. Well can, but won't. Should, maybe, but shorn't.",michael,14
20874,"What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.",michael,31
20875,We won't let you down.,andy,5
20876,"Oh you can't because I don't care. Listen, [Kevin and Andy high five as they leave Michael's office] don't forget to fill out those cards. My love cards.",michael,28
20879,[to Jim] Who are you putting down?,pam,7
20880,"Oh, you don't know her.",jim,5
20881,Who is it?,pam,3
20882,Your mom.,jim,2
20883,"Yeah, whatever. [Jim holds up the card] [Pam laughs] Give it to me. Give it to me.",pam,17
20884,"Ok, Wendy. Hot and juicy red head. Give this a try. [Michael dials phone number. Phone rings.]",michael,17
20886,"Hello Wendy, this is Kevin's friend, Michael.",michael,7
20888,"Oh, I'm sorry, could you put her on please?",michael,9
20890,"[under breath] Damn it Kevin. OK, umm, could I just have a frosty and a baked potato please?",michael,18
20892,"Well, I'll send somebody to come pick it up. Just have it ready.",michael,13
20894,Well put it aside. [hangs up the phone] [Dwight enters] Umm... yeah.,michael,12
20895,"OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.",dwight,9
20896,Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model...,michael,13
20897,"I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.",dwight,37
20898,"That sounds good. [both smile] Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go.",michael,24
20899,"[on phone] That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed.",dwight,17
20900,"The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information. [reads from notepad] Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed.",dwight,49
20901,She's dead? [Dwight makes knife slitting noise] She's so young.,michael,10
20902,She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died.,dwight,19

20906,Try not to be so hurtful Jim.,michael,7
20907,"Jim, how dare you. [Jim's face is in shock]",dwight,9
20908,"Please, not at a time like this. [sighs]",michael,8
20909,"OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you.",pam,11
20910,Oh really? What's her name? Burger King?,michael,7
20911,"No, I mean it. [walks towards Michael] She's really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along. [hands over card to Michael]",pam,24
20912,"I don't, I don't think I'm ready. Is she hot?",michael,10

20916,"[while brushing teeth with an electric toothbrush] No, not the five families.",michael,12

20923,[turns around to see the woman from his description] Ugh.,michael,10
20925,Is who a Michael what?,michael,5
20927,"Oh, that's not, yeah I'm not... OK...",michael,7
20929,So you get the rent checks every month and what happens next? What...,michael,13
20931,Just making conversation.,michael,3
20932,"Why is it so hard to meet people? I... you know... it's uh... All I want is somebody nice and sweet and someone I can talk to and share an experience with, you know? Why is it so hard for people like us?",michael,43
20934,You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind. [holds up cell phone with a picture of Jan] Look at that.,michael,26
20936,"Yeah. Yeah, and you can't see her whole body. Down here, she's got a boob job. Just... she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don't know.",michael,29
20939,"Oh, OK. Well, umm... I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus.",michael,24
20941,Now you ruined it. [gets up and leaves],michael,8
20943,Uh Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement.,andy,14

20958,"Margaret the land lady? Really Pam, is that what you think of me?",michael,13
20959,She's sweet and cute. I thought you'd get along.,pam,9
20960,"Oh, OK, Well I'm looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I'm a man... of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately. God...[walks away back to his office]",michael,30
20961,[walks up to reception] Margaret?,jim,5
20962,I know.,pam,2
20963,You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. [both laugh],jim,11
20964,"Oh I don't care, I didn't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move.",pam,16
20965,"Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud.",jim,26
20966,"Yeah, maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob, too.",pam,16
20967,"OK, sure. Let's do it. [Pam laughs]",jim,7
20968,"No, I umm, well I'm not gonna, I'm, I'm not gonna move in with anyone unless I'm engaged.",pam,18

20971,"Oh, well, that's coming. [smiles]",jim,5
20972,"Oh, right now?",pam,3
20973,"No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame.",jim,12
20974,"OK, so then, when?",pam,4
20975,"Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works.",jim,18
20976,"Oh, right, yeah.",pam,3
20977,"Wait, I'm serious. It's happening.",jim,5
20978,Ohh kay.,pam,2
20979,"And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp.",jim,14
20980,I've been warned.,pam,3
20981,I am not kidding. [shows camera an engagement ring] Got it a week after we started dating.,jim,17
20982,I don't know man. I was with Jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. It's just... [sighs],michael,26
20983,You know what you need? Closure.,dwight,6
20984,You're right. What do you mean though?,michael,7
20985,"There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye.",dwight,29
20986,Hmm.,michael,1

20994,"Yeah, there it is. You're welcome.",andy,6
20996,[looking at the chair model's headstone] How did she die?,michael,10
20997,I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.,dwight,29
20998,God.,michael,1
20999,Yeah.,dwight,1
21000,She was so innocent.,michael,4
21001,She was stoned apparently.,dwight,4
21002,"You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that's just silly because she's dead. What do you do?",michael,30
21003,You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive.,dwight,16
21004,"Oh, you move on.",michael,4
21005,Yeah.,dwight,1
21006,Where do you want to go for dinner?,jim,8
21007,"I don't know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what [Jim gets down on one knee], that one...",pam,25
21008,"Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?",jim,14
21009,[smiling] I hate you. [walks away],pam,6
21010,"What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? [Pam laughs] Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh.",jim,19
21011,"Oh, oh.",pam,2
21012,"No, no, no.",jim,3
21013,How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?,pam,12
21014,"[singing] Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids...drinking whiskey and rye, oh why'd you have to go off and die? Why'd you have to go off [with Dwight] and die?",michael,45
21016,Return.,michael,1
21017,Rhythm and blues...,dwight,3
21018,This'll be [with Dwight] the day that I died.,michael,9
21020,"Okay, so look that over, make sure it's accurate.",dwight,9
21021,Oh.  What is this?,michael,5
21022,"Your bill, minus the ten percent Dunder Mifflin corporate discount.",dwight,10
21023,You were charging me?  I'm your friend.,michael,8
21024,You occupied the America room for six weeks.  That's our most popular room.,dwight,14
21025,There was no other guest the entire time I was here.,michael,11
21026,Right.  Because you were in the America room.  In an election year.,dwight,14
21028,"Thank you, Dwight.",michael,3
21029,"We don't take debit cards, anyway.",dwight,6
21030,"Dwight, little help with the bags, please.",michael,7

21033,"A cute little religious type, someone who wears a uniform, or...",michael,11
21035,"No, no, obviously older.",michael,4
21037,"Love.  Marriage.  Baby carriage.  Those have been my goals ever since I heard that song.  Jan and I had love.  We did not have marriage.  We did have a baby carriage, which I got her for bringing groceries home, after she got a DUI.",michael,50
21039,"[sitting at her desk] Hey, Kelly.",michael,6
21041,Nothing.  Just hangin'.  Chillin'.  No agenda.  Would you consider hookin' me up with one of your friends?,michael,21
21043,Yeah?,michael,1
21045,That's hilarious.  What's her number?,michael,6
21047,"Mmm... nah, that's too young.",michael,5

21062,I just...,pam,2
21063,"You know, just a fun, guh, look, there, here, it doesn't have to be a model.  I'm not, don't rule out model, but just in terms of models, there are like twenty different categories.  There's face models, hand models, body models [Jim raises hand] - yes.",michael,48
21064,I actually know a sex model.,jim,6
21065,Really?,michael,1
21066,"Yep.  Yeah.  She's blind, is that a problem?",jim,10
21067,"No, I am, it's all about the personality, Jim.",michael,9
21068,Okay.,jim,1
21069,Are you talking about Beverley?,pam,5
21070,Yes.,jim,1
21071,Because she's not a sex model.  She's a tollbooth operator.,pam,11
21072,"Oh, yeah.",jim,2
21073,Send me a picture.,michael,4
21074,"So far, these are my leads.  A blind tollbooth operator and a twelve hundred pound catcher.  It's a start.",michael,21
21075,What's wrong Michael?,pam,3
21076,I got gum in my hair.,michael,6
21077,You do.,pam,2
21078,"This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it.",michael,10
21079,You've got a ton of dandruff.,dwight,6
21080,"OK, let me be.",michael,4
21081,How'd you get gum in your hair?,jim,7
21082,"I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanley's car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil.",michael,34
21083,"But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.",jim,10
21084,Kill me... right now.,michael,4
21085,We have peanut butter in the kitchen.,pam,7

21096,[sighs],michael,1
21102,"Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?",jim,10
21104,"Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that.",jim,36
21106,Thanks.,jim,1
21108,Did I? I don't...,jim,4
21110,Hmm.,jim,1
21114,Yeah.,michael,1
21116,Question.,dwight,1
21118,Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?,dwight,19
21127,I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all.,dwight,13
21128,"Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.",jim,11
21130,And then an older gentleman asked you 'Boxers or briefs?',jim,10
21136,Well it has been nice seeing you again my friend.,michael,10
21138,"Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad. [hugs Ryan]",michael,10

21332,"[on phonne] I am. I am getting out there. Well, no I've asked a lot of girls to dance mom. They're just, it's not... [Ryan is dancing feverishly and falls over] Yes, I shaved above my neck. Oh my God, mom, I gotta go. One of my friends is getting beaten up by some girls.",michael,55
21333,"Actually, it's kind of too bad we're not coming into work tomorrow.",pam,12
21335,"I bet Michael had some elaborate theme party planned, like Scrambled Egg Saturday. [a few chuckles]",pam,16
21337,[Michael and Troy dragging Ryan out of the club] Those girls really wailed on you bad.,michael,16

21379,OK. Good night Ryan.,dwight,4
21380,Best night ever.,michael,3
21381,"Like I said, it's not about the horniness, it's about the loneliness. And how can I be lonely with my boys? Like a famous person once said, Boys on the side. But I don't, I disagree, I say... let's hear it for the boys.",michael,44

21473,"Greatness is only skin deep, some people say...",jim,8
21474,Can you breathe?,dwight,3

21476,Hold your breath.,dwight,3
21477,And in this case...,jim,4
21478,Ready?,dwight,1
21479,That's also not true.,jim,4
21480,And... go. [Michael sticks his face in the cement] Force it in as deep as you can.,dwight,17
21481,[muffled] That's what she said.,michael,5
21482,"Today is a very special day for me. And it's really not about me, it's about my grandkids, it's about my great grandkids... I can come back here when I'm 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, 'That's me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole...' I dunno, it's a good feeling.",michael,57
21483,"[playing with Madlibs] Okay, adjective...",andy,5

21491,"[wearing glasses] Um... yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend's house and, I forgot my contact solution, so... I had to wear my backup glasses... Shut up.",pam,28
21492,"All right, everybody... Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You're moving in the wrong direction...",michael,31
21493,I don't have my contacts...,pam,5
21494,"Ub, dub dah, don't need, I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we're going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.",michael,33

21496,"You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly...",jim,11

21498,Would...,jim,1
21499,"If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no.",pam,13
21500,"Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.",jim,29
21501,"Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?",michael,57
21502,"What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more... zing, and a little more pep?",andy,22
21503,"Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim?",michael,16
21504,What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?,jim,17
21505,"Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme...",michael,16
21506,An urban thing...,jim,3
21507,"An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley...",michael,15
21509,"Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group.",michael,14

21513,We're havin a little brainstorm session...,michael,6
21515,"...Good, this is good. I'm going to grab a glass of water.",michael,12
21517,"Ugh, what?",michael,2
21519,What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened.,michael,7
21521,That? In the conference room?,michael,5
21523,"We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said 'did I stutter,' and I said 'wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?' It was joking, Toby, alright?",michael,24
21525,"Well you don't get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you're... you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another: 'Hey um, you're poor.' 'Well hey, you're mama's dead.' That's what friends do. It's... you're so white.",michael,47
21527,Mmhmm.,michael,1
21529,"Okay, I will... I'm not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but...",michael,23
21531,"Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it's probably psychological.",michael,15
21532,"You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're always driven by chicks, so there's your icebreaker.",andy,35

21534,That's a racing stripe.,andy,4
21535,"Uh, bumper's sagging.",dwight,3
21536,"Mmm, I doubt that very much.",andy,6
21537,This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.,dwight,11
21538,How next to?,andy,3
21539,"Well, here are your options: you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff... you can donate it to a person that you'd like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and I'll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey.",dwight,59
21540,I have to pick one of those?,andy,7
21541,Yes.,dwight,1
21542,Can you go over those options again?,andy,7
21543,"You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now.",dwight,23
21544,"Well I have the, the blue book value...",andy,8
21545,"Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one--",dwight,13
21546,Can I think about it?,andy,5
21547,"Five, four, three, two...",dwight,4
21548,Let me think about it--,andy,5
21549,Now. Now. Now.,dwight,3
21550,Let me think about it--,andy,5
21551,Say it. Do it. Now.,dwight,5
21552,I'm thinking about it--,andy,4
21553,Do it now.,dwight,3
21554,Thinking--,andy,1
21555,Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.,dwight,14
21556,Yeah. All right!,andy,3
21558,"I, uh, see that you... gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal.",michael,31
21560,"Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn't mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned, so we are cool.",michael,43
21563,"Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?",dwight,18
21564,Uh huh...,michael,2
21565,There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...,dwight,14
21566,Great,michael,1
21567,"However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.",dwight,24
21568,What's the pink?,michael,3
21569,Menstrual cycles.,dwight,2
21570,"Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?",michael,14
21571,You.,dwight,1
21572,Other than me.,michael,3
21573,"Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.",dwight,23
21574,I never said you could do that.,michael,7
21575,All you have to do it say it.,dwight,8
21576,I...,michael,1
21577,Just say it.,dwight,3
21578,"Okay, I will think about it.",michael,6
21579,"Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.",dwight,48
21580,No.,michael,1
21581,"So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself.",dwight,12
21583,"Oh, thanks.",pam,2
21585,"Oh, okay...",pam,2
21587,I should probably get back to...,pam,6
21589,Entering the....,pam,2

21596,"Darryl, [clears throat] have you ever been in a gang?",michael,10
21598,"It's an advice question, and if you don't wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It's, um...",michael,17
21600,"I know, it's very, very personal...",michael,6
21602,"I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?",michael,11
21604,God.,michael,1
21606,Okay.,michael,1
21608,"Okay, so dig this: you're on the street, and one of your gang disses you.",michael,15
21610,"Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?",michael,14
21612,What is that?,michael,3
21614,Really?,michael,1
21616,I would've never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.,michael,11
21619,Oh boy...,jim,2
21621,"On a wing and a prayer, mostly.",jim,7
21623,A formal warning... [chuckles],jim,4
21625,"[stammers] I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head.",jim,24
21627,"I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really...",jim,16
21630,"Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want?",pam,7
21631,"Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...",jim,8
21632,Because you're very important?,pam,4
21633,Yeah...,jim,1
21634,[washing the Xterra] Rocka doopa deepa do POW! Shacka do DO! Oh! What's Dwight up to? Oh probably nothing. Racka do do dee do-do do-do! Sha-KA!,dwight,26
21635,What the hell is this all about? [holds up flier] You're flipping my car for profit.,andy,16
21636,It's my car now.,dwight,4
21637,I gave you a deal... based on what you said to me.,andy,12
21638,"Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay.",dwight,22
21639,"I've got a Madlib for you: a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named Andy Bernard sold his Xterra to a smart and capable man named Dwight. This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight.",dwight,35
21640,"Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him.",michael,38
21641,What does that mean?,pam,4
21642,It's like a mock execution.,michael,5
21643,That's not a good idea.,jim,5
21644,Yes it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left.,michael,14
21646,"No, okay... I've had enough of you.",michael,7
21648,"Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay?",michael,14
21651,"Stanley Hudson, you are fired.",michael,5
21653,"I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack.",michael,14
21655,Hmm.,michael,1
21657,"Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice.",michael,24
21659,That's it. And uh... do you have anything to say to me?,michael,12
21661,Okay...,michael,1
21663,Yes.,michael,1
21665,That's not-,michael,2
21667,"All right, all right...",michael,4
21669,Okay.,michael,1
21671,"Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out.",michael,6
21672,Who?,jim,1
21673,"Everybody, except Stanley.",michael,3
21674,Let's go.,jim,2
21675,I can't find my glasses.,pam,5
21676,"Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here.",jim,19
21677,"Okay, okay.",pam,2
21679,[starts to cry] I don't understand why you keep picking on me.,michael,12
21681,"You just, do, and I don't know why, so... please help me understand.",michael,13
21683,"Well Stanley, maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well.",michael,17
21685,"All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it.",michael,33
21688,"So I'm thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas sale-abration. And we call it, a summer sales-a-lot. Feedback? Anybody? Stanley?",michael,54
21691,"Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis.",michael,7
21692,"You know, I don't care what he did to me.  He's mean to other people, that's what gets me.  He's just...",michael,23
21693,Who else is he mean to?,jim,6
21694,"Everybody.  He just, he's always, he's always talking about people behind their backs to me.",michael,16
21695,What kind of stuff does Stanley say?,pam,7
21696,"Like that people are stupid, and that they're idiots, and that they're sluts.",michael,13
21698,"Because he's mean.  He's, he's like a really mean-spirited guy.  He talks about how gay Oscar is...",michael,19
21699,Mm-hmm.,jim,1
21700,"And that Angela's a midget, and that [indicates Jim] your chin is too big.",michael,14
21701,Hey.,jim,1
21702,"I know, I know.  I think it's tiny.  I think it's too small if anything.  And that your glasses make you look ugly.",michael,26
21703,She's never worn these glasses before.,jim,6
21704,"Well, he's just mean.",michael,4
21705,"Michael, I think that what Stanley did to you was rude.  Maybe you should just get him aside and tell him that he was behaving badly.",pam,27
21706,"It's complicated, Pam.  I mean, the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk.",michael,17
21707,"Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him.  And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash.",jim,38
21709,Okay.,michael,1
21710,"I put Stanley on a pedestal, for a long time.  But sometimes he can just be a big, fat jerk.  I... jerks don't deserve to be on pedestals.  Jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are.  Big marble... jerk stand.",michael,50
21711,"Pam, stand up.",michael,3
21712,"Hi everyone.  My name is Pam, and I wear glasses.",pam,11
21714,Pretty disgusting.,michael,2
21716,"Thanks, Phyllis.  Yours, too.",pam,5

21721,Huh.  Maybe I will.,pam,5
21725,"Hi, can I help you?",pam,5

21729,Yeah.,pam,1

21768,"Oop, got some blisties.",andy,4
21770,"Hit about 1200 balls last night, in preparation for today, so hands are a little tender. [shows blisters on both hands] It's actually not funny at all. It's incredibly painful.",andy,30
21772,Great!,jim,1
21775,"So many memories in this old gym. Pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play volleyball, pretending I have PMS so I didn't have to play basketball. Those were the days!",pam,33
21776,"[Darryl approaches as students throw basketballs] A little over the top, don't you think?",michael,14

21799,"He's totally wrong, Pam. [to Justin] Hey.",michael,7
21801,"How you doing? Listen, I don't think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker. [takes back the info flyer Justin holds] Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby.",michael,59
21803,"Oh, no problem. [looks down] And he signed!  He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately.",michael,51
21805,I only brought the one.,pam,5
21806,Are you mental?,michael,3
21807,"Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, 'Are you sure Michael?' And you said 'Pam! Pam! Pam!' And then you sneezed in my tea, and then you said, 'Don't worry, it's just allergies.' Do you remember that?",pam,59
21808,I... don't.,michael,2
21809,Okay. I'll go look for another one. [she leaves],pam,9

21874,Excuse me.,pam,2
21875,"Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.",michael,20
21877,"So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn't bring are even better. Justin, I'm willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special.",michael,48

22288,What the hell is that?,michael,5
22289,Michael...,pam,1

22326,I'm cool.,michael,2
22328,"Holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I'm pretty sure she's baked on a professional level.",michael,42

22851,Let's go mini-golfing.,michael,3
22853,Uh...,michael,1
22855,"Um, I think you'll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time.",michael,22
22856,Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.,dwight,14

22914,"No, you're definitely the problem.",jim,5

22955,Fair question.,jim,2
22957,It's my sumo suit.  I just didn't inflate it all the way.  I am so glad that I bought instead of rented.,michael,24
22958,Body image.  We are here because there is something wrong with society.,michael,13
22959,"See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you.",jim,16
22960,"If it's me, then society made me that way.  Now, I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, 'Why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?'",michael,30
22962,How do you know Michael Clump?,michael,6
22964,How dare you! Michael Clump is a celebration of fat people.,michael,11

23216,"Ok, let's give it for Miss... Holly Flaaaax! [everyone claps]",michael,10
23219,Nice. [they bump fists],jim,4
23221,"[clapping] Ok.  Well done.  Good speech Ryan, you're a good guy.",michael,13
23225,"Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic. [claps]",michael,14
23230,Hey-oh!,andy,1
23231,Yes.,dwight,1
23232,[to Holly] Can't set 'em up like that.,michael,8
23236,Can we have a moment?  [whispering] Can I talk to you for a sec?  Lot of good stuff. And you look... you look fantastic.,michael,26
23238,Yeah.,michael,1
23239,What should we be working on while you guys are talking?,dwight,11
23240,"Do some... do some work. [whispering to Holly] People expect a lot from these meetings.  Laughter, sudden twists.  Surprise endings.  You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan.  You need to be Robin Shyamalan.",michael,40
23242,Do you... just... you're kind of losing them.,michael,8
23244,"Yeah, don't think about the stakes.  It'll freak you out.",michael,11
23246,"[coughs to hide his words] Lauren, [coughs] enough with the pencils.",michael,11
23249,I'll drop an ethics bomb on you.  Would you steal bread to feed your family? ... Boom!,andy,18
23251,"Yeah, I took intro to philosophy,",andy,6
23252,"It's a trick question.  The bread is poisoned.  Also, it's not your real family.  You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.",dwight,25
23253,No that's... not how it works.,andy,6
23254,I would not... steal the bread.  And I would not let my family go hungry.,michael,16
23256,"Anybody?  This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions.  Stanley?  Oscar, come on.",michael,20
23258,I will go first.  When I discovered,michael,8
23260,To tell you or not.  And I'm glad I did.  I feel very very good.  Cathartic.  I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble.  You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.,michael,44
23262,"Yeah, [interrupting gibberish].  Come on, anybody.  Let it fly.",michael,11
23264,A siesta!,michael,2
23265,Time thief.  Time thief!  Fire him!,dwight,8
23266,"Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time?",jim,8
23267,Never!,dwight,1
23268,You are a thief of joy.  Anybody else.  Yeah?,michael,11
23270,Who hasn't?  Good.  Good!  What else?,michael,9
23272,Mmm...,michael,1
23274,"Well, let's keep this party movin' on.",michael,7
23276,Bruuuuuuuuuce.,michael,1
23278,Jackpot.,jim,1
23279,Ach! Wuh---,michael,2
23284,Oh...,michael,1
23286,Nnyeah.  What ya gonna do?,michael,6
23289,"Meredith, why don't you tell Holly... it's not what she thinks.  Nothing unethical happened... and that you just like to sleep around.",michael,23
23291,"No... no, this is just a stupid formality.",michael,8
23294,Ughh!  For the love of God we're trying to help you... stupid bag.,michael,14
23299,"[starts a stopwatch as Dwight yawns, stops it when Dwight is done] Yawn.  Four seconds.",jim,16
23300,What are you doing?,dwight,4
23301,Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure.,jim,18
23302,"Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn?  That's absurd. [Jim smiles and starts the stopwatch] Really? [in a mocking voice] Oh hey look, monkey knows how to use a stopwatch everybody!  He's ti--- [Dwight conceeds and goes back to work, Jim stops the watch]",dwight,53
23303,Personal conversation.  Seventeen seconds.,jim,5
23304,There is no way that that was--- [Jim starts the watch],dwight,11
23305,[stops the watch] One second.,jim,5
23306,"Well, well.  Holly... lujah!  It's a miracle, you're at your desk.",michael,13
23308,"Hoo-ooh!  Reaching!  You'll get there.  Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there's no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can't, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out.",michael,41
23310,Good.  Would you care to bang it out over lunch?,michael,11
23312,"Oh no, no, no.  Your food is no good here, my lady.  [sweeps her food into the trash can, misses]  Sorry!  You know what?  Let's go out!  Dunder Mifflin's treat.  Um, actually you're not a client... so... we'll just split it?  Ethical.",michael,50
23314,What do you think?  What do you think of this place?,michael,12
23316,"Istn't it?  Yeah, it's kind of... business/romantic.  So you're from Des Moines?",michael,14
23318,"Wow, that sounds so... warm.",michael,5
23320,Here too.  You know what my favorite season is?,michael,10
23322,"Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way.  Autumn was what I was going to say.  When the leaves change.  It's just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons.",michael,36
23324,"Wow, terminator, terminator.",michael,3
23326,Yeah.,michael,1
23327,"Hey, Andy.",jim,2
23328,Yo.,andy,1
23329,"By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?",jim,10
23330,"No, I did not.  Was that any good?",andy,9
23331,Actually not.  It was really so-so.,jim,7
23332,"Ok. [Dwight turns around, but Jim holds up the stopwatch, threatening to start it]",dwight,14
23333,"I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but... [Dwight begins to turn around again, Jim holds up the watch] Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?",jim,41
23334,Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica?,andy,8
23335,"You know, it's weird.  It's practically a shot for shot remake.",jim,12
23336,"Really? [Dwight closes his eyes, clutches the paper in his hands] Huh, that's cool.",andy,14
23337,Story's kinda bland.  It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.,jim,20
23338,Really?  That doesn't sound right.,andy,6
23339,"I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance.  I mean, what sort of place is that to call home?  And Meredith needs this job.  This is her main source of money.",michael,39
23341,"Ok, new idea.  We don't report it at all.  We just punish her.",michael,15
23343,"Mmhmm, tell her she can't have sex for six months.",michael,10
23345,"I don't know.  I saw this thing, like a belt with a key.",michael,14
23347,"No, it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal.  You know what I am talking about.  You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the...",michael,45
23349,I am just saying that I don't think that you understand what I am saying.,michael,15
23351,Yes.,michael,1
23353,Well... bleh busted.  I don't...,michael,6
23355,"Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.",michael,14
23357,I will be honest with you.  That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault.  The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don't want to take the elevator with her.  And I am holding on to her leftovers. [throws Holly's leftovers in the trash],michael,57
23358,[Dwight walks back to his desk] 19 minutes and 48 seconds.  What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?,jim,22
23359,None of your business.,dwight,4
23360,So I guess I can assume that was personal.,jim,9
23361,"[Dwight stares at Angela, buttoning the top button of her blouse] Fine.",dwight,12
23362,So maybe you're not completely ethical after all.,jim,8
23363,"Yes, maybe I'm not. [Dwight grins and gives a sly look at the camera]",dwight,14
23366,What's the only thing worse than one HR rep?,michael,9
23368,You get me.,michael,3
23370,"I don't know.  Can you?  Kendall, my main man.",michael,11
23373,Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.,michael,14
23383,"How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, 'I told you so.'  Gently with a rose?  In a funny way, like it's a hilarious joke?  Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? ... Probably the funny way.",michael,50
23385,"No way, lady.",andy,3
23389,"Ok, everybody listen up.  If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.",michael,22
23391,Get in there right now or I'm gonna lose it! [everyone gets up to go in the conference room],michael,19
23393,"Now is really not the time, Meredith.",michael,7
23399,"Wait a second, how does the steak factor in again?",andy,10
23409,Let's keep this rollin'... Ryan?,michael,5
23410,"Oh, but you mean other than embezzling?",jim,7
23412,Fraud.,jim,1
23439,"Oh, cr..., oh, God.  Meredith, you know what?  I just need a minute, okay?",michael,16
23441,What do you need?,michael,4
23443,I... really want to keep you.,michael,6
23445,"Wait, what?",michael,2
23447,Nnnngah!,michael,1
23448,[looking pregnant] Hey Michael?,dwight,4
23449,Yeah.,michael,1
23450,Contractions are coming every ten minutes.,dwight,6

23452,My cervix is ripening.,dwight,4
23453,"OK, good.",michael,2
23454,"[drawing two family trees on a whiteboard] Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight.  Now, this baby will be related to Michael through [draws a question mark] delusion.",jim,45

23456,"Oh, OK! OK!",michael,3
23457,Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?,dwight,9
23458,I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.,michael,13
23459,Right. Highways or surface roads?,dwight,5
23460,I take Quincy Ave to Gibson.,michael,6
23461,"No, Gibson is covered in potholes.  Your car breaks down. Adapt!",dwight,12
23462,"I checked the route - there are no potholes.  Come on, get in here and have the baby.",michael,19
23463,It's about adapting to the circumstances.,dwight,6
23464,"[annoyed] Andy, would you like to have my baby?",michael,9
23465,Yes! Yeah.  [squatting and pushing] Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa!,andy,9

23495,Yes.,michael,1

23501,"Hello ladies, how's my shower going?  Phyllis, did you get the live storks?",michael,14
23503,"Damnit, Phyllis!  I'm sorry.  [more softly] Damnit, Phyllis.  It was hard enough to convince Jan to come.  So are we set for refreshments?",michael,27
23507,She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So...,michael,11
23510,"It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine.  I am going to love it. It's like when the dog nurses the tiger cub.  Have you seen that video?  It is... it's so bizarre and unnatural, but... it, it happens.",michael,48
23517,"[banging on the glass] Hey, hey.  What are you doing?  Don't talk to them.",michael,16

23526,"Anyway, Bogre's TA Sarah Kaya comes in.",pam,7
23527,"Wait, who's Sarah Kayacombsen?",jim,4

23529,OK.,jim,1

23563,Really...,jim,1
23564,Oh no... [Michael enters and notices Jan's baby],dwight,8
23565,Jan had the baby and Michael wasn't there to mark it.  So the baby could be anybody's.  Except Michael's.,dwight,21

23616,OK.,pam,1

23730,Oh yeah.  Wait 'til you get to know her better though.,jim,12
23731,"Hey! HR lady, stop whispering in the corner please.  Very rude.  You're ruining the party.",michael,17
23756,"Not so weak, huh, Mom?",dwight,5
23758,"Let's see what this baby can do... [drives car fast, holding stroller alongside the car, stroller remains fine] Aaaah!  Aa-aaah! [throws it ahead of the car, it goes for a while and then is stopping]  It's a hardy stroller. [takes watermelon out of stroller, holds it up to show camera] Maybe it's safe!",dwight,55
23760,"Okay, thanks.",pam,2
23761,"New York, as it turns out, is very expensive, and I ran out of money. I thought about selling a kidney, but Michael offered to get me a part-time job at corporate.",pam,32
23762,Hey.,pam,1
23763,Paaam-o-laaaaaa...,michael,1
23764,"Of course, now Michael knows where to reach me 16 to 18 hours a week.",pam,15

23769,That was really fun last night.,michael,6
23771,I'm actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs.,michael,12
23773,Yeah?,michael,1
23775,Oh really?,michael,2
23777,Well...,michael,1
23779,"I, uh... [to camera] I let her win.",michael,8
23781,"So, when, um, can I see you again?",michael,8
23783,No.,michael,1
23785,"Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good. [Holly's smile quickly fades] Because I am busy taking you out.",michael,18
23787,[concerned] Why?,michael,2
23789,"Wow... Oh, wait a second, I can't tonight...",michael,8
23791,Tonight's so...,michael,2
23793,"Too many times. It's all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.",michael,15
23795,You're welcome.,michael,2
23796,"In my opinion, the third date is traditionally the one where... you have sex. Does Holly feel that way? I don't know. I will probably find out tonight. If she starts having sex with me I'll know for sure.",michael,39
23797,"That's for you. And, um, oh. I am right in assuming that Dwight is short for D-Money. 'Cause that's what I wrote on your save-the-date.",andy,25
23798,[whispering] You set a date?,dwight,5
23799,"J-Money. Or should it be T-Money, for Tuna? Receptionist Money. K-Money.",andy,11
23801,A knife.,dwight,2
23803,You got a better way?,dwight,5
23805,About what?,dwight,2
23807,"I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know.",dwight,14
23809,Yeah.,michael,1
23811,"Some of what we order depends on whether we're having sex after. [laughs] Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we're going to have sex tonight?",michael,34
23813,"Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... We'll just do the restaurant thing first.",michael,21
23815,Probably get soup or something light.,michael,6
23817,"She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine.",dwight,17
23819,I was talking to myself.,dwight,5
23821,I just don't get it.,dwight,5
23823,Why is she marrying Andy?,dwight,5
23825,That's really fattening.,dwight,3
23828,"No. No. Reservations are at 8:00, so we've got like an hour and 45 minutes. [sighs] [goofy voice] I'm a crazy eight, I'm crazy.",michael,24
23831,Do you need 'em?,michael,4
23833,All right.,michael,2
23835,Thank vous. [chuckling] What? Oh! [kissing],michael,6
23837,Not if we turn these dials [getting louder] all the way down. [whispering] Now they can't hear us at all.,michael,20
23839,We're totally alone.,michael,3
23845,"Oh, my God, what happened?",michael,5
23846,We were robbed last night.,jim,5
23847,"Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have.",dwight,32
23849,Yeah. Oh... oh!,michael,3
23851,"No, did you?",michael,3
23853,"Oh, no, my God.",michael,4
23855,Oh my God!,michael,3
23856,So much for sex without consequences.,michael,6
23857,[Jim holds up phone] You are such a dork! Shots!,pam,10
23858,"So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning.",jim,18
23859,I'm not drunk.,pam,3
23860,I'm on minute six of this message.,jim,7
23861,"Okay, I do not sound like that.",pam,7
23863,Scranton.,pam,1
23864,The future mother of my children.,jim,6
23866,"You're always safe with me. I'm a very good screamer. And one day, we're going to move to Disney's Celebration Village in Florida and leave all of this behind.",andy,29
23868,Yeah?,andy,1
23870,[cockney accent] Consider yourself... at home!,andy,6
23871,[Dwight groans] Ugh.,dwight,3
23872,Get in.,dwight,2
23874,"I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so.",dwight,16
23876,Are you sure that's going to work?,dwight,7
23878,"Wait, this isn't our floor. Dwight...",dwight,6
23882,"We're gonna make everything all right. Alright? Conference room, 15 minutes. Half an hour. Alright?",michael,15
23883,"To recoup their losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I'm calling it crime-aid. It's like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it is us fighting against our own poverty.",michael,49
23885,Thank you.,michael,2
23887,"Okay, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?",michael,30
23889,"Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people like in the olden days.",michael,21
23892,Do you need us for any of this?,jim,8
23893,Do I?,michael,2
23895,"Yeah, I think that's pretty boss.",michael,6
23897,Whoa!,michael,1
23899,Twice. ... Right?,michael,3
23901,Mm-hmm.,michael,1
23903,"Listen to me close. 'Cause I'm only gonna say this once. You either break off your engagement with that singing buffoon, apologize, and then date me, or you can say good-bye to this. [points below his belt]",dwight,37
23905,I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 6:14 PM. 6:14!,dwight,15
23911,"It squeaks when you bang it, that's what she said. Let's hear it for me! Right? A bargain at any price!",michael,21
23913,"Oh, yes, great. Very good, Um, so, Darryl, and the boys in the hood in the warehouse, have graciously donated to, uh, go out for a beer with them right now. You know what, I'm actually going to bid on this. I'm going to start the bidding, because this is something that I have dreamt of-",michael,56
23915,5 dollars.,jim,2
23917,"Okay. Okay, sold! Have fun, you guys. Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you don't win it. It just says 'Creed.'",michael,28
23920,I can see that.,jim,4
23922,"Another round, boys? Great. [Jim walks to the bar]",jim,9
23925,Hey man.,jim,2
23927,"Oh, I wouldn't-[clears throat]",jim,4
23929,I'm good. How you doing?,jim,5
23931,"Yeah, okay.",jim,2
23936,"Let's hear an opening bid, everybody. Who's first? Kevin do your taxes. He's the tax man. Kevin the tax man.",michael,20
23938,Federal and State. [no one bids],michael,6
23940,"Okay, alright. Hey, you know what? I would appreciate it if people would stop storming off the stage.",michael,18
23942,"We are getting there folks. Slow and steady. [David Wallace walks in] Well, well, have we been blessed today. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. David Wallace! Whoo!",michael,26
23944,Hey!,michael,1
23947,"100 dollars, great.",michael,3
23950,"Hey Phyllis, someone let the air out of your tires. Come quick.",dwight,12
23952,Keep it going. Hey batter batter batter.,michael,7
23954,160,michael,1
23955,I had to get your attention. This is an emergency. [the air is let out of one of Phyllis' tires],dwight,20
23957,"Listen, she ignored my ultimatum. Now what?",dwight,7
23959,"Okay, fine. I've moved on. Now how do I get her back?",dwight,12
23961,"Wait, that's it? That's your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan.",dwight,16
23963,Oh. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish. [Phyllis slaps Dwight] And you slap like a girl.,dwight,29
23964,What did Phyllis do wrong? I'll tell you what Phyllis did wrong. She stuck her nose into my business and tried to help me. [Dwight has an epiphany],dwight,28
23966,"Oh, she's good actually.",jim,4
23968,"She's, um, she's in New York. She's at an art school.",jim,11
23970,"Yeah, she's doing really well.",jim,5
23972,"She's engaged, um... to me.",jim,5
23974,"Oh, thanks man. Appreciate that.",jim,5
23976,"Yeah, I'd say she's happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 8:00 AM.",jim,28
23978,What?,jim,1
23980,[driving] I am going to see Pam. Because I feel like I should. [sighs],jim,14
23982,"Uh, just a few more items.",michael,6
23984,"All right, all right, all right, all right, all right! Here we go. All right, big ticket item. [cheering] All right, in my pocket, I have... two tickets... to Mr. Bruce Springsteen, front... Oh, where are those? Has anyone seen an envelope with Bruce Springsteen front row tickets and backstage passes? Anybody seen something like-lying around?",michael,56
23986,"No. I think they were stolen. I think they were stolen and they're gone forever. So... oh, that was the last good item. So, good job, everybody.",michael,27
23988,"Yeah, well, Phyllis, nobody... really wants a hug, so.",michael,9
23990,"She's your wife, you idiot.",michael,5
23993,"Uh, what the hell is happening?",michael,6
23994,250,andy,1
23996,"I need a hug, unless you're gonna give me one.",andy,10

24021,"Eh, it's not worth it.",dwight,5
24022,"1,000 going once, 1,000 going twice. Sold for 1,000 dollar. [applause] Nicely done.",michael,13
24023,"[driving, sighs, laughs] No. you know what? No. Because... I'm not that guy. And [laughs] we are not that couple. [turns around]",jim,22
24024,"[whispering] Hey, that looks good. Listen, about the tickets. It's sort of a gray-kind of a gray area in terms of...whether or not I had them- [Holly covers Michaels mouth]",michael,30
24027,"What can I do for you, Michael? I'm kinda busy.",pam,10
24028,"Oh, I guess that job that I got you is working out for you well, then.",michael,16
24029,It is.  Thanks again.,pam,5

24031,"[long pause] And of course, if there's ever anything I can ever do for you...",pam,15
24032,You know what?  I would love a slice of real New York style pizza.,michael,15
24033,"If I get you a slice of pizza, are we even?",pam,11
24034,Even as pie.,michael,3
24036,I just don't know if he's presidential enough.,jim,8
24037,I know.  And how long is CJ gonna spin this whole MS thing?  How can Josh and Sam keep quiet?,pam,22
24038,"Every night, Jim and I watch an episode of The West Wing together on DVD.  Um, he wanted to watch Battlestar Galactica and I wanted to watch Cranford... so we compromised.  Next we're gonna watch Cranford.",pam,38
24039,Cranford?  No.  We will never watch that.,jim,9
24040,I am going to run three possible date ideas by you and I want you to tell me which one gets your blood percolating.,michael,24

24042,"I have two sure things, one wildcard.",michael,7
24043,Let's start with the wildcard.,jim,5
24044,Okay.,michael,1
24045,Mmm-hmm.,jim,1
24046,The wildcard is dinner at a nice restaurant.,michael,8
24047,Uh-oh.,jim,1
24048,"Exactly.  Here, here are my sure things.  I blindfold her.  I take her to the Houdini Museum.  She chains me up...",michael,25
24049,I think I got a pretty good sense of that one.,jim,11
24050,Okay.,michael,1
24051,Yep.,jim,1
24052,All right.,michael,2
24053,Let's move on to the next.,jim,6
24054,"Number two, we go to the mall...",michael,7
24055,Mmm-hmm.,jim,1
24056,"We go to the bed store, I let her choose whatever bed she wants...",michael,14
24057,"Oh, that's good.",jim,3
24058,And we have sex on it.,michael,6
24059,I like the wild card.  I'm already liking the wild card.,jim,12
24060,"Really?  I don't know.  It's a big third date, Jim.",michael,12
24061,Mmm-hmm.,jim,1
24062,What do I do?,michael,4
24063,Have you asked her what she wants to do?,jim,9
24064,"Well, I thought as the man that I should make the decision.",michael,12
24065,No.  You got that backwards.,jim,6
24066,"Times have changed, Jim.",michael,4
24069,"I'll bring you one tomorrow.  You've earned it.  [bites into the sandwich half, chews]  Mmm.  I hope you like fox meat.",dwight,25

24092,Thanks.  My costume's getting a lot of attention. [Pam is dressed as Charlie Chaplin],pam,15
24093,"So apparently no one dresses up for Halloween here. I wish I had known that before I used greasepaint for my moustache. And I can't even take off my hat, because then I'm Hitler.",pam,34
24094,"[dressed as the Joker] Hm mm mm mm. Want to see a magic trick? Heh heh heh! I'm gonna make a pencil disapp-- oh! [elevator doors close, reopen.] Disappear.",dwight,29

24109,"Ah, you are quite the gentleman.",michael,6
24110,You can let people go a couple of minutes early if you want.,michael,13
24111,All right. We'll see. [to camera] No.,jim,7
24112,"I am off to New York. My brother Pete from Boston, and my brother Tom from New Jersey are taking Pam and I out for lunch, to celebrate the engagement. Or maybe to beat me up. I can never tell with those two.",jim,43
24113,Good morning temp.,dwight,3
24115,Thought I'd go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning.  Hello.  How are you Phyllis?,dwight,16
24116,Ha ha ha. That's funny. [angrily] Take that sweatshirt off!  Hey buddy.,andy,13
24117,Andy.,dwight,1
24118,"Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them.",andy,38
24119,"No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying!",dwight,24
24120,"Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?",andy,9
24121,"Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.",dwight,14
24123,"I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy.",dwight,16
24124,"Cornell is a good school, and I want to better myself through higher education. If it makes Andy angry, so be it. [He sips from his Cornell mug]",dwight,28

24131,"Hey there. So uh, how do you think we're gonna do against Penn this year? Nathan Ford's arm looks pretty strong.",dwight,21
24132,"Well he's had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying 'we.' You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you're just doing this to screw with me.",andy,27
24133,"Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage.",dwight,21
24134,"I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red.",andy,15
24135,"Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.",dwight,15
24136,Hey!,pam,1
24138,How are you Tom. Nice to see you.,pam,8
24140,"I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, 'That Pam Beasly, she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She's the best! The absolute best.'",pam,46
24141,"Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it.",pam,38
24147,"So, not the ring then? The- the- Not doing the ring?",pam,11
24151,"Okay, okay.",pam,2
24153,Oookay....,pam,1
24154,They came up with that idea really fast.,pam,8
24157,Ah! Ah! Ahhhh!  [waking up] Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare.,michael,14
24159,Was I?  Really? Was I saying anything interesting?,michael,9
24161,"All right. What's the scoop, how far?",michael,7
24164,"Halfway! Okay, You know what I want to do, I want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast.",michael,34
24167,Hey guys.,pam,2
24168,"Hey, how are you?",jim,4
24169,Hi! [smooches],pam,2
24170,Good to see you.,jim,4
24173,All right so now we can sit... and get comfortable.,jim,10
24175,"Yeah. I don't know I just- I imagined a hotel right here. Pool, over here. Really good breakfast place. With really good bacon.",michael,23
24176,"Here we go, fourth time's a charm. 'Life's like a road where you just... one day here, and the next day back...Sometimes you deal with it, today you don't, sometimes you do, what you want... there's a world out there.... [Holly sobs] Hey. Are you crying?",michael,46
24178,Allergies?,michael,1
24180,Did Darryl touch you?,michael,4
24183,What's the matter?,michael,3
24185,Sure it is.,michael,3
24187,"Oh no no no.. It's gonna work, it'll be fine.",michael,10
24189,Listen to me. I like you so much.,michael,8
24191,And I've dated four women in the last--,michael,8
24193,Not last - no. In like the last ten years.,michael,10
24195,"I've dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid.",michael,15
24197,That's what she said.,michael,4
24198,"Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. I'm gonna make this way harder than it needs to be.",michael,30
24199,Take that down. [Dwight has hung a large red Cornell banner from the ceiling],andy,14
24200,Excuse me?,dwight,2
24201,Take. That down.,andy,3
24203,I seriously doubt that anyone from Cornell dated you.,andy,9
24205,It's pronounced 'Corn-ell!' It's the highest rank in the Ivy League!,andy,11
24206,"Andy, let's just talk about this man-to-man, after work.",dwight,9
24207,Fine.,andy,1
24208,What do you say?,dwight,4
24209,"Yeah, good. Can we--- [Dwight pulls out Cornell mascot bobble-head] Grr. Heh heh heh. That's Big Red Bear! That's a bobble Big Red Bear! God!!",andy,25

24215,"I'll tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by, things that I witness on the road.",michael,19
24217,Maybe I'll see an accident one weekend?,michael,7
24219,Years!,michael,1
24221,Yeah.,michael,1
24223,"Here's my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy.",michael,18
24225,"My wish has come true, incidentally, because, you've met me, and you are happy.",michael,14
24229,That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.,jim,17
24231,"Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal?",jim,9
24234,Yup! [Tom and Pete give Halpertian looks to camera],pam,9
24235,"You know what? I think we're a great couple. I think we're a classic couple. I think we're like Romeo and Juliet. I think we... go together so well.  We're like peanut butter and jelly, don't you think?",michael,39
24237,Then don't do it. Please don't do this. Please don't do this. [they continue arguing],michael,15

24749,Easy.,jim,1
24750,OK.,dwight,1
24751,Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk.,jim,9

24763,Bye.,jim,1
24764,[on Bluetooth] That was weird.,pam,5
24765,What was?,jim,2
24766,Have you ever had a conversation with Kelly where she didn't go on for 15 minutes without taking a breath?,pam,20
24767,"No, actually.",jim,2

24779,"Well, Andy has a mug just like that.",jim,8
24781,No. What party?,jim,3
24783,I wasn't. But thank you. [to Pam] Do you know anything about this party?,jim,14

24790,No. Why? No. [puts it in desk drawer and slams it shut],dwight,12
24791,"OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the thing: I think you're right. I think it was Kelly. I think she's mad at us for not coming to her party.",jim,31
24792,"Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators?",dwight,9
24793,Probably just Kelly.,jim,3

24814,Dwight. [to Kelly] I was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate.,michael,20

24820,"[looks momentarily flattered, but thinks better of it] Kelly.",michael,9
24822,"You cannot say 'I was raped' and expect all of your problems to go away, Kelly. Not again. Don't keep doing that. I'll give you one last chance to come clean. Just tell me what happened.",michael,36
24824,We have our confession. I'm calling security. [reaches for phone],dwight,10

24898,"Dwight and I are both writing letters to our clients. I'm just sending a quick note to say how much I appreciate their business, and he is writing notarized letters to inform them them that lying on customer reviews is a prosecutable form of fraud and defamation. It's just... different styles.",jim,51

25116,"Honestly, I don't know what we're waiting for.",andy,8
25118,What is wrong with her?,andy,5
25120,I should call her and ask her. What is wrong with her?,andy,12
25122,"Too late, too late. It's dialing... now it's ringing. [Oscar laughs] Shh...",andy,12
25124,What is wrong with you?,andy,5
25127,That was Oscar and he wants to know why you won't do me and I think it's a valid question.,andy,20
25129,This is Andy Bernard!,andy,4
25131,I wanna take you to sex school.,andy,7
25133,[over phone] Who is that monkey?,dwight,6
25134,Is somebody there?,andy,3
25136,I have needs.,andy,3
25138,Naked.,andy,1
25140,We'll discuss it later naked.  I want to see you naked.,andy,12
25141,[standing outside hotel room... whispering] Do you want to get some breakfast or something?,michael,14
25143,Okay.,michael,1
25144,[noticing that everyone is giving him a sympathetic look] How does everyone know already?,jim,14
25145,Know what?,dwight,2
25147,"Oh, well, doesn't surprise me.",dwight,5
25148,Excuse me?,jim,2
25149,"Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions.",dwight,16
25152,What? Are there two suns?,dwight,5
25155,"Last I checked, that's not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy.",dwight,12
25156,I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee.,jim,7
25157,It's totally unrealistic.  There are no lines in the parking lot.,dwight,12
25158,Oscar,andy,1
25160,That was fun last night.,andy,5
25162,"You know, it's true what they say--- Long Island iced teas are way stronger in Canada.",andy,16
25164,You kidding me? It's what I do. Get the whole nine 'nards. [Oscar laughs],andy,14
25166,Totally. [continues laughing] What--- Who?,andy,5
25168,We called Angela?,andy,3
25170,"That was real?! I thought I dreamed that.  Oh, God!",andy,11
25172,"Oh, God!",andy,2
25174,So bad!,andy,2
25176,Slept like a baby.,michael,4
25193,"Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here.  They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter.  They are treated like human beings. [sighs]",michael,37
25195,Yes.,michael,1
25196,"Oh man, she is so pissed. [sitting down by Oscar]",andy,10
25198,She's taking us back to first base.,andy,7
25200,I get to kiss her forehead. [looks at Oscar] I had a good time hanging out this weekend.,andy,18
25202,Wingman for life. W.M.F.L,andy,4
25204,You up for a chest bump?,andy,6
25206,Bro hug? [Oscar shakes head... then sticks his hand out and Andy shakes it] Back to basics. I like it.,andy,20
25207,I had to go all the way to Canada to get to know a guy who sits 20 feet away from me.  And he's delightful! [laughs],andy,27
25209,"Yeah, we locked him up for two years.",michael,8
25211,No. Actually the trip sucked.,michael,5
25213,"The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip.",michael,15
25215,"I did not like the trip. Well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van.",michael,18
25217,And business class which was basically just coach. And the hotel which sucked big time.,michael,15
25219,"It was not, it sucked.",michael,5
25221,Oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige.  That was great.  That was great.  That was--- that was a---,michael,23
25223,That was a really good choice.,michael,6
25225,"No, David. You listen to me.  Why did you send her away? That--- God.  You knew I liked her and you just sent her away.  And that--- that was a sucky thing to do man.",michael,38
25227,That was a really sucky thing to do.,michael,8
25231,Thanks man.,jim,2
25233,I missed you.,jim,3
25234,I missed you too. [Jim kisses her],pam,7
25235,You're back.,dwight,2
25236,"Uh, yeah.",pam,2
25237,Good. I need you to make five copies of these. [hands Pam papers],dwight,13

25240,Welcome back.,jim,2
25249,"Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie.",dwight,19
25250,So why did you come in here?,jim,7
25251,To socialize.  And inform.,dwight,5
25252,"Oh brownies! I'm taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.",michael,21
25255,Yeah why don't you send that to him in Costa Rica?,michael,11
25257,"Heh, okay, weirdo.",michael,3
25258,"Why is that, why is that weird?",jim,7
25259,She said she was going to give it to him right now. [starts laughing],michael,14
25260,"[laughing] She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.",jim,12
25261,"Yeah, they used to.",michael,4
25262,Toby works here again.,jim,4
25263,"Oh, can you imagine?",michael,4
25264,Oh no.,jim,2
25265,Uhhgh.,michael,1
25266,You don't know.,jim,3
25267,I don't know.  What?,michael,5
25268,"You should probably just meander back there; take a look.  See if he's, see if he's back.",jim,18
25269,"Hmmm, dare I? [laughs]  You know what? I'm going to, for old time's sake.  [walks to the annex, standing in Toby's cubicle] Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex. [turns around and sees Toby]",michael,41
25271,"NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO!",michael,9
25272,[watching Toby at Phyllis' desk through his office blinds] Look at him.  With his stupid face.  Stupid... tan. No.,michael,21
25273,He looks great.,dwight,3
25274,No.,michael,1
25275,Well rested.,dwight,2
25276,He looks worse.,michael,3
25278,"Uh, well I'm afraid not.  Toby Flenderson, of H.R., has made a sudden reappearance.",michael,15
25280,"Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David.",michael,13
25282,Yes.,michael,1
25284,"I learned a while back that if I don't text 911 people will not return my calls.   Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened.",michael,35
25286,I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved.,michael,19
25287,"Also, it's icky back there.",dwight,5
25288,That's true.  People say it's icky.,michael,7
25290,"David, wait.",michael,2
25292,Is there no way we can get rid of him?,michael,10
25294,I have cause.  It is be-cause I hate him.,michael,10
25296,No.,michael,1
25298,I don't.,michael,2
25300,"[Dwight comes over, starts to massage Michael's shoulders] Don't do that.",michael,11
25301,"[pours something from the fridge into a bowl and opens the microwave, it is covered in exploded food] Oh, come on! [to the documentary crew] Do you see this?  Disgusting.",pam,31
25302,"So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old man's place?",andy,10
25303,"Yeah, I am.  Wait, how do you know that?  I didn't tell you that.",jim,16
25304,"Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk.  I saw some email.  I got peepers of an eagle.",andy,21
25305,That's really not cool.,jim,4
25306,Kaaw!,andy,1
25308,"Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you're right.",jim,7
25310,Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?,jim,17
25311,"Whoa, you haven't told the misses about the castle?  You're in for a spanking my friend.  Myself and my lady? - no secrets.",andy,25
25313,"Oh thanks, Phyllis.",jim,3
25315,"Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry?",jim,10
25318,Definitely we should.,jim,3
25320,That is just obnoxious.,andy,4
25322,"Yeah.  Wait, what, the mess or the note?",pam,9
25325,Don't you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?,pam,13
25326,"No, the note is way more obnoxious than the mess.",andy,10
25328,"Just because someone likes things clean, doesn't mean they're rich.",pam,10
25330,"You want to see some really high caliber acting?  Well, Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served. [walks to the annex] Hey Toby, great to have you back, man.  Seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again.",michael,44
25332,You're welcome.  Missed you.  Missed you as part of our family.,michael,13
25334,So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun?  That must have been fun.,michael,16
25336,"Nice beaches, pristine beaches?",michael,4
25338,Why'd you come back?  Why didn't you stay?,michael,9
25340,"I bet, for you.",michael,4
25342,"[shifting uncomfortably and sweating] Shhh hot, why didn't you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.",michael,19
25344,"Yeah, I am.  I am.",michael,6
25346,"Okay, just summarize.",michael,3
25347,"Okay, fireable offenses include: workplace violence and sexual harassment.",dwight,9
25348,"That's it, that's it, perfect.  We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.",michael,23
25349,I love catching people in the act.  That's why I always whip open doors.,dwight,15
25350,"Mm.  Me too.  Okay, let's get this started.",michael,10
25351,Okay [stands up removes jacket and starts loosening his tie],dwight,10
25352,What are you doing?,michael,4
25353,[removes glasses] I am the bait.,dwight,6
25354,For what?,michael,2
25355,Men find me desirable.,dwight,4
25356,"No, no, no.",michael,3
25357,"Oh, it's a good day too. I'm wearing my mustard shirt.",dwight,11
25358,You're the bait for Toby?,michael,5
25359,Mmhmm.,dwight,1
25360,"No, for one thing, he's not gay.  And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim.  Or Ryan.  Or me.",michael,25
25361,Men find me desirable.,dwight,4
25362,"Yes, sure they do, Dwight.",michael,5
25363,"When it comes down to it, it's a health issue.  I should have written that.",pam,16
25364,"Mmhmm, yeah.",jim,2
25365,[looks up] Why aren't you as mad or interested in this as me?,pam,13
25366,"Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?",jim,11
25367,Are you inching away from me?,pam,6
25368,No.,jim,1
25369,Reach your arms out.,pam,4
25370,[laughs and swings his arm out which doesn't come close to touching the reception desk] I'm always this close.,jim,19
25371,"Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah.  Hello, Pam.  Jim may I have a moment with Pam please.",michael,20
25372,"Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so...",jim,10
25373,"Oh, oooh his mistress.  No. I'm kidding.  No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam.",michael,22
25374,"What do you need, Michael?",pam,5
25375,"Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson?  I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits.  Do not read it beforehand.  Can you do that for me?",michael,45
25376,"Good. [Pam stands up and starts reading note] N-no no no, don't.",michael,12
25377,"Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle.  I'm too shy to tell you that I love you.'",pam,22
25378,"Pam.  Pam, you gave me your word.",michael,8
25384,"Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them?",michael,14
25386,Toby can I see those? Ooh. [takes photos and throws them on the floor] What's the matter?  What's the matter? You scared?,michael,23
25387,Those are fighting words.,dwight,4
25388,You mad? You mad at me?,michael,6
25389,I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you.,dwight,10
25390,"Do you want to do that?  You want to hit me, you want to punch me?",michael,17
25391,Hmmm?,dwight,1
25392,Huh?  He might do it...,michael,6
25394,I dare you to.  Come on.,michael,7
25395,Come on. [making karate moves] Baaah!,dwight,6
25396,What's the matter... haaaww!,michael,4
25397,"Hit him!  Hit him, Chicken.",dwight,6
25399,"Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who's side are you on?",michael,10
25400,"Ryan.  Come on, man?",dwight,5
25401,"No do it, do it.  I dare you.",michael,9
25402,Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.,dwight,11
25403,"Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch.  Come on! Come oooon...",michael,17
25405,Are you really not going to punch him?,dwight,8
25407,Son of a bitch.,michael,4
25409,I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day,dwight,12
25410,[mouth full of brownie] Just stop it.  You haven't done anything helpful all day.,michael,15
25411,There's still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.,dwight,11
25412,What's that?,michael,2
25413,"[goes over and closes office door] Frame him, for using drugs.",dwight,11
25414,Frame him?,michael,2
25415,"Yeah, it's illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal.",dwight,12
25416,"I've never framed a man before, have you?",michael,8
25417,Oh I've framed animals before.  I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present.  And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.,dwight,27
25418,Just seems awfully mean.  But sometimes the ends justify the mean.,michael,12
25419,"Hello.  I've seen you guys around.  I'm Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin.   How you doing?  [they stare at him] Uhghh, so I guess you know why I'm here?  I need to purchase something.",michael,38
25421,"No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some...",michael,11
25423,"Grass, weed?",michael,2
25425,I heard you drug---  I heard you dealt.,michael,9
25427,"I'm not wearing a wire, so...",michael,6
25430,How much? How many pounds is it?,michael,7
25435,Thank you.,pam,2
25437,"I know, can you believe it?",pam,6
25439,"I guess that's why we have a temp, huh?",pam,9
25441,How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?,pam,11
25443,"You've seen things cleaned before though, right?",pam,7
25446,"Hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  I forgot... I forgot...",michael,10
25449,I don't know anything about that.,pam,6
25451,Here?,pam,1
25452,"Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay?  Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy.  Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.  [leads them back towards the annex as Creed stands up and starts to put him hands up and then relaxes them behind his ears]",dwight,57
25454,"Those are real cops, real guns.  I wonder what's going on. [follows them]",michael,14
25455,"Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator.",dwight,7
25457,Search his things.,dwight,3
25462,"They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission.",dwight,11
25464,"Uh, you know what?  I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.",michael,15
25468,"Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.",dwight,8
25470,"Yeah, let's just cancel this, okay?",michael,6
25473,"No, no no no... No, no.",michael,6
25475,"No, that was... that was legitimate.  That was totally legitimate.",michael,11
25478,Oh God!,michael,2
25480,"No, no no no no.",michael,5
25483,"God! No, that's not... I don't know what that is.  And I... I bet he has nothing to do with that!",michael,22
25486,"Ahh, that's mine.",michael,3
25487,"No! Michael, no!",dwight,3
25488,"Yes, it's mine.",michael,3
25492,Are you kidding me?  That's my salad.,michael,8
25493,"So wait a minute, there's no drugs?",dwight,7
25495,"Gahh, dammit! [punches file cabinet] Come on!",dwight,7
25497,"Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him?",dwight,11
25499,[following them out] You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation.  Why don't you use them?,dwight,20
25500,You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.,michael,9
25502,Hmm.,michael,1
25504,Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.,michael,10
25506,"Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me, that's who you're worried about?  You're... you're worried about the cop's time?  You think I framed you, and you're worried about the taxpayer?  Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face.",michael,41
25507,You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us.  So...,michael,16
25509,"Yes, you did.  And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history.",michael,17
25511,Do you want to hear a lie?,michael,7
25513,I think you're great.  You're my best friend.,michael,9
25524,"[walking out of the building] Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?",jim,18
25525,Sure.,pam,1
25526,Cool.,jim,1
25527,[getting out of the car] What are we doing at your parent's house?,pam,13
25528,"I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now [spins her around once] open your eyes.  Tadah!",jim,25
25529,I don't get it.,pam,4
25532,I love it.,pam,3
25533,You do?,jim,2
25534,"Yeah, I love it!",pam,4
25535,Really?,jim,1
25536,"I mean, you bought me a house!",pam,7
25537,Oh my God...,jim,3
25538,You bought me a house!,pam,5
25539,"Yeah, I did. [they kiss]",jim,5
25540,"Um, do we have to sleep in your parent's bedroom?",pam,10
25541,"No, No, we'll just board that up.  It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.",jim,19
25542,And the clown?,pam,3
25543,"Yeah, I can't... really can't move him.",jim,7
25546,Mmm... okay.,michael,2
25548,"Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old.",michael,22
25550,Yes.,michael,1
25552,There's the x-ax...icks.,michael,3
25554,"Mmhmm, okay.",michael,2
25556,Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five.,michael,10
25558,Ho-oh!,michael,1
25560,Yeah.,michael,1
25562,I'll be six.,michael,3
25564,So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus.,michael,9
25566,[whistles poorly] Whoo.,michael,3
25568,"Okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, I-I think I'm getting you...",michael,14
25569,"Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please... [imitates drum roll] Can anybody guess?",michael,46
25570,New chairs?,pam,2
25571,"No, a new copier! [only Oscar applauds] Unless everybody can agree on something better?",michael,14
25573,"Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.",pam,17
25574,So... we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?,michael,10
25575,"[over indistinct conversation] Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good...",pam,10
25577,"Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands.",pam,13
25579,Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.,pam,10
25580,"Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, let's just decide and agree upon one.",michael,15
25582,"Alright, so, teams forming.",michael,4
25584,You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.,michael,10
25586,Michael?,pam,1
25587,Yes.,michael,1
25588,"I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this.",pam,17
25589,"Uh, actually, I'm gonna go with copier.",jim,7
25590,What? Jim.,pam,2
25591,"Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything.",jim,45
25595,Why me?,michael,2
25596,You have to make the decision.,jim,6
25597,"Wow, okay. Well... I swallowed all your ideas, I'm going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.",michael,21
25598,"Dwight, I'm a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms...",andy,13
25599,"Yeah, do tell.",dwight,3
25600,"I mean, like, '156 paces from the light red mailbox, make a left.'",andy,13
25601,Mmhmm.,dwight,1
25602,Walk until you hear the beehive.',andy,6
25603,How could it be more clear?,dwight,6
25605,Okay.,dwight,1
25607,"We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine.",dwight,16
25609,"Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on.",dwight,9
25610,"Let's three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, how's that for a plan?",andy,23
25611,"We're getting married at Schrute Farms, no matter what. I have looked at twelve venues, I have lost eight deposits, and I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit.",andy,34
25612,Hey.,pam,1
25613,Hey.,jim,1
25614,"So um, I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing...",pam,10
25615,Mmhmm.,jim,1
25616,I really think you should reconsider.,pam,6
25617,"Oh, Pam, I really... hate that copier.",jim,7
25618,"Yeah, I know.",pam,3
25619,Yeah.,jim,1
25620,But I really think you should reconsider.,pam,7
25621,"Beesly, are you threatening me?",jim,5
25622,"Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I'm not threatening you. I love you. [whispers] But you should know, you're on very dangerous ground [kisses Jim]. [at normal volume] All right.",pam,28
25623,Okay.,jim,1
25624,[shudders] Whew.,jim,2
25625,This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such.,dwight,20
25626,"Hmm... mm, what's that smell?",andy,5
25627,You're gonna need to be more specific.,dwight,7
25629,Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.,dwight,8
25631,"You wanna eat, don't you?",dwight,5
25633,"Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?",andy,14
25634,...I'll consider it.,dwight,3
25635,"See? That's how you do it! Makin' progress here. [steps in manure, trying to laugh it off] ...Darn! Heh.",andy,19
25636,There's a hose out back.,dwight,5
25637,Okay.,andy,1
25638,"Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?",pam,20
25639,Yes.,michael,1
25640,Well that never happened.,pam,4
25642,I don't know. I haven't decided yet.,michael,7
25644,"Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing.",michael,7
25645,"Woah, you guys going to lunch?",jim,6
25646,Yes.,michael,1
25647,Mind if I join?,jim,4
25648,"Ohh, God!",michael,2
25649,All right.,jim,2
25650,Yeah!,michael,1
25651,Let's go.,jim,2
25652,Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!,michael,4
25653,Let's do it.,jim,3
25654,All right! Cool!,michael,3
25655,Where we going?,jim,3
25656,I have no idea.,michael,4
25657,"So, I guess that's how they're gonna play this. It is on. [very serious] It is so on.",pam,18
25658,"Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I've had two engagement rings, and only one chair?",pam,27
25660,"Michael, that is hilarious.",jim,4
25661,"[through the laughter] Oh, is somebody making fun of me?",michael,10
25663,Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.,jim,9
25664,Aww.,pam,1
25665,Yeah.,jim,1
25666,"That's cool. [opens the container and smells the tiramisu] Mm, good stuff. [throws it in the garbage]",pam,17
25667,You look really pretty.,jim,4
25668,Thank you. [goes to Michael's office and knocks on the door],pam,11
25669,Yeah.,michael,1
25670,Michael?,pam,1
25671,Yeah?,michael,1
25672,Hey!,pam,1
25673,"Oh, hey.",michael,2
25674,You got a second?,pam,4
25675,I do.,michael,2
25676,"Oh, good.",pam,2
25677,"Oh, that must've been so fun.",pam,6
25678,it was fun. We had a good time.,michael,8
25679,"Hey, have I told you you look really nice today?",pam,10
25680,"Oh, thank you.",michael,3
25681,"Yeah, is that a new tie?",pam,6
25682,"Um, no, not... no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars.",michael,13
25683,That is amazing!,pam,3
25684,You think that's good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.,michael,10
25685,What?,pam,1
25686,Nine dollars. The boys' department.,michael,5
25687,No.,pam,1
25688,Look at the ass. Check out the ass.,michael,8
25689,[applauding] No way!,pam,3
25690,Look at that. [begins dancing] Unh. Unh-unh.,michael,7
25691,"Yeah! Oh, so I guess Oscar and Jim were talking your ear off about the new copier.",pam,17
25692,Yes they were.,michael,3
25693,Yeah.,pam,1
25694,They were.,michael,2
25695,Here's what I was thinking: everyone sits on a chair every day...,pam,12
25696,Mmhmm.,michael,1
25697,But not everyone...,pam,3
25698,Sits on a copier.,michael,4
25699,Or even uses the copier every day.,pam,7
25700,Yeah.,michael,1
25701,"Yeah, right?",pam,2
25702,Very valid.,michael,2
25703,...That's it. [giggles],pam,3
25704,All right.,michael,2
25705,"All right, see you later...",pam,5
25706,See ya.,michael,2
25707,Hot tie guy.,pam,3
25708,[laughs] Hahaha!... well...,michael,3
25709,Have you made a decision on the butter sculpture?,dwight,9
25711,"Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard.",dwight,9
25713,Cats don't make butter.,dwight,4
25715,It doesn't make any sense.,dwight,5
25717,"Okay, guys!",andy,2
25719,"Cow, goat or sheep.",dwight,4
25720,"What is this? All right, we're all on the same team. Is it- [steps in manure] Damn! Why is that in the kitchen?!",andy,23
25721,"[Pam is making copies and is struggling with the machine] You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.",jim,25
25722,"No, copier's great.",pam,3
25723,Yeah?,jim,1
25724,Yeah. I have my copies. [holds up messed up copies],pam,10
25725,There they are.,jim,3
25726,"And I have my original. [holds up original paper, ripped in half]",pam,12
25727,You got it.,jim,3
25728,So suck it.,pam,3
25729,Okay.,jim,1
25730,Okay.,michael,1
25732,"Oh, thank you my dear.",michael,5
25734,"Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay...",michael,9
25736,"There he is! Hello, hello!",michael,5
25738,Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.,michael,9
25739,Oh!,jim,1
25740,Mm! [gives Jim a high five] Yeah!,michael,7
25741,There's that ass!,pam,3
25742,Hey hey! Yeah! Unh!,michael,4
25743,"Woo! Yeah. Aw, don't take it away!",pam,7
25744,"Oh... ah, I almost choked.",michael,5
25745,Here's another place.,dwight,3
25747,Hey-o!,andy,1
25748,"So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here.",dwight,53
25749,[whistling Pachelbel's 'Canon in D;' switches to singing then back to whistling],andy,12
25751,I'm Andy.,andy,2
25753,He doesn't understand a word you're saying.,dwight,7
25754,What?,andy,1
25757,"And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife.",dwight,13
25759,Did somebody call Hank?,pam,4
25760,"Hank, thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads.",michael,11
25762,"Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue. [Hank takes some jellybeans from Pam's jar] Yeah, take as many as you want.",michael,34
25764,Yes.,michael,1
25766,"Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-",michael,17
25768,"Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.",michael,27
25770,"It is, yes.",michael,3
25772,What?,michael,1
25774,Okay.,michael,1
25775,You can try mine.,pam,4
25776,"Oh, there we go.",michael,4
25778,"Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.",michael,18
25780,"So, the copier.",michael,3
25782,"All right, yes.",michael,3
25784,"Well, what should I do?",michael,5
25786,"All right, get out. Get out.",michael,6
25788,I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything.,dwight,13
25790,"Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, 'I do.' And I said, 'I do.' And Andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness.",dwight,31
25792,"Yes, of course it does.",dwight,5
25794,It does in the state of Pennsylvania.,dwight,7
25796,"Haha, Mrs. Schrute.",dwight,3
25798,Wha...,dwight,1
25800,My... It's not my fault you don't understand German; I've been telling you to take it for years!,dwight,18
25801,"Are we, uh... are we leaving or what? [Mose hits Andy in the head with a deflated ball] Ow!",andy,19
25803,Hey David- [begins coughing violently] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I'm stopping now.,michael,25
25805,"No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm calling- [coughs again] I'm sorry.",michael,12
25807,"Mm. I'm calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.",michael,16
25809,"No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy.",michael,16
25811,The what now?,michael,3
25813,...Like a tip? [calculates amount] $645?!,michael,6
25814,"I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king.",michael,29
25815,"[on the phone] We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you.",jim,19
25816,"All right, attention everyone.",michael,4
25817,Let me call you right back. Okay.,jim,7
25818,"I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is... [puts paper on glass and makes a copy, then takes paper from glass] working perfectly.",michael,36
25822,Do I know what?,michael,4
25824,"Mm, no...",michael,2
25826,"Yeah, know what?",pam,3
25828,$645.00,michael,1
25830,Right.,michael,1
25832,Because that is how my mind works.,michael,7
25834,"Wait, what?",jim,2
25835,You can do that?,pam,4
25837,Let's see...,michael,2
25838,You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?,pam,18
25839,"I don't need $645; I already have $645, more or less.",michael,11
25841,This is so stupid.,michael,4
25842,Or chairs?,pam,2
25843,"This is so, so stupid. And, God... [looks at his watch] that's my phone.",michael,14
25845,To be continued!,michael,3
25846,"No, I don't-this doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.",michael,40
25847,"Hey Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you. [Angela walks over to Andy] What-",andy,16
25849,Was that hot or what?,andy,5
25850,So what's it gonna be?,pam,5
25852,"Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.",pam,16
25854,[groans in frustration] You think it's easy?,michael,7
25856,"Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I'm taking the bonus. All right?",michael,40
25857,"It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put 'em in a room, and you just- [Pam and Oscar come to the door of kitchen] Hey.",michael,44
25858,Hey.,pam,1
25860,What?,michael,1
25862,Thanks Michael.,pam,2
25863,Good work. I'm proud of you. [Pam and Oscar leave] Mother-,michael,11
25865,Truce?,jim,1
25866,"Yeah, I guess, since I won.",pam,6
25867,"Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. [begins to walk away, then turns back] Totally kidding. [leans in, whispers] I'm gonna need four. [kisses Pam]",jim,39
25868,What is this?,dwight,3
25869,"Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.",jim,10
25870,You're so pathetic.  How long did this take you? Three hours?,dwight,12
25871,Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.,jim,12
25872,"Yeah, no such thing.  They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid. [scoffs]  Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes.",dwight,35
25873,I think it'll take you a little longer than that.,jim,10
25874,"Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my -- [sets briefcase on desk and sits in chair, desk and chair are made of paper, Dwight crashes to the floor]",dwight,42
25879,"Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party?",michael,13
25881,Awesome.  I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.,michael,14
25890,Ah. You brought in your doll collection.,jim,7
25891,"These are not dolls, Jim.  These are commodities.  Same as gold or oil.",dwight,15
25893,That's the Christmas spirit.,jim,4
25894,I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift.  And such a genetically improbable one.  Look at that.  How does that happen?  King has sex with a unicorn?  Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse?,dwight,53
25895,Yes.,jim,1
25896,"Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn?  I thought they were all sold out.",michael,14
25897,They are now.,dwight,3
25898,Cool. [sings] My horn can pierce the sky.,michael,8
25899,"This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything.",michael,22
25901,Alright... One more time around the block.,michael,7
25902,I will grant you one wish.,jim,6
25903,I wish that you'd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.,pam,12
25904,Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. [Pam laughs] Dumb.,jim,14
25905,"[sitting on floor playing the sitar] Hey, hey... Ange... check it out.  [sings] There's a place in France where the naked ladies dance. [laughs]",andy,25
25907,[sings] There's a hole in the wall where the men can see it all.,andy,14
25908,"Jim, Jim....",michael,2
25909,What is it?,jim,3
25910,That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice.  I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.,michael,16
25911,"Wow, that is delicious.",jim,4
25912,Yeah.,michael,1
25913,Can't believe no ones thought of that.,jim,7
25914,I know.,michael,2
25918,All right.,dwight,2
25920,"Oh, so glad I could help.",dwight,6
25922,Merry Christmas.,dwight,2
25924,Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-ka-ching.,dwight,1
25925,"[sighs] Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn't left India.",michael,16
25926,"[Meredith's hair is on fire] Oh, oh, oh, oh!",jim,9
25927,We got a live one!  On fire!! [Dwight extinguishes Meredith],dwight,11
25929,Sorry.,andy,1
25931,"Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth",michael,10
25933,Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?,jim,10
25934,"No, no. I celebrate privately.",michael,5
25935,That's cool.,jim,2
25936,Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly.,michael,11
25938,We'll do it quickly.,michael,4
25939,Well what if we can't do it quickly.,jim,8
25940,[mimicking] What if we can't do it quickly? What if we cant do it--,michael,14
25942,"Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.",michael,9
25943,"An intervention.  It's sort of hard to describe, but really its-- it's a coming together... it's a surprise party for people who are-- who have addictions.  And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves.  And then they stop.",michael,53
25947,"Okay, how do you feel?",michael,5
25949,Uck... T.M.I.,michael,2
25951,Yeah.,jim,1
25952,"Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.",michael,21
25954,I am not asking her to stop drinking.  I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.,michael,18
25956,"Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand. [everyone raises their hand]",michael,21
25957,Aye.,dwight,1
25958,The aye's have it.,michael,4
25960,"Alright, well, let's look at this a little bit closer then shall we? [pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket]",michael,22
25962,"Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?",michael,17
25964,Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?,michael,15
25966,Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?,michael,15
25968,"I got it on a website, that's not important.",michael,9
25970,"Okay, you know what Toby?  One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this.  I'm doing your job man.  Hey, are you texting?",michael,38
25974,That's-- you didn't-- you weren't hurt by that.,michael,8
25977,"Okay, no, that's not what we're going for.  Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking?  It has to bother you.  It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you?  Dwight, don't you have anything?",michael,38
25978,"No, I like Meredith.",dwight,4
25979,"Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing.  In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. [holds up his fist] Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.",dwight,37
25980,Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke?  Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?,michael,24
25982,"Was John Belushi fine?  Was Bob Hope fine?  Hey-- come here.  If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.",michael,35
25984,I want you to say I'm an alcoholic.,michael,8
25986,"You can say it as loudly as you want, but we're not going to believe you.",michael,16
25995,"[amid groans from the rest of the office] Alright, no, no, no.  No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting.  But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today.  What about tomorrow.?  What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead?",michael,58
25996,I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.,dwight,10
25997,"There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.",dwight,24
25998,"Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore.  The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.",michael,37
25999,"Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.",dwight,8
26000,Dwight--,michael,1
26001,She is a hazard to the other people of the office.,dwight,11
26002,[sighs]...okay.,michael,1
26003,I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.,dwight,17
26004,"Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.",jim,9
26005,"Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks.",dwight,8
26007,Really?,dwight,1
26010,"Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.",jim,17
26011,"Enabler!  Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler.  It's Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.",michael,23
26012,"You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better.  That's my only wish.  But you know what?  My wishes never come true, so I'm not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice.",michael,47
26013,[watching Meredith and Michael talk in his office] They've been in there for 45 minutes.,jim,15
26014,"I know.  If she wasn't an alcoholic before, she is now. [Jim laughs]",pam,14
26017,[Andy playing the sitar] Hey.,jim,5
26018,What's up?,andy,2
26019,Do you take requests?,jim,4
26020,Sure.,andy,1
26021,Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.,jim,8
26022,[whispers to Meredith] I'll be down in a minute. [walks over to Toby] Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?,michael,26
26025,We did?,michael,2
26027,"Oh, shoot.  Oh well, we'll have to go someplace else then I guess.",michael,14
26029,"We could go there, sure.",michael,5
26031,"Yes, yes.",michael,2
26033,I have a new place.,michael,5
26035,"It-- yep, recently.",michael,3
26037,All right.,michael,2
26039,"Yeah, oh there you go.",michael,5
26041,That's good.,michael,2
26043,We're party girls.,michael,3
26048,$200.00,dwight,1
26051,"Oh, that's my last one.",dwight,5
26055,Not my problem.,dwight,3
26066,It's okay. It's all right.,michael,5
26068,"Meredith, we are doing this for your own good.  Okay. Come on--",michael,13
26070,Here we go. This is gonna be good.,michael,8
26072,Yes you are. [tries to pull Meredith from the car],michael,10
26075,Shhh... just calm down.,michael,4
26077,[chasing Meredith] Come on. Shh...,michael,5
26079,Here's the door. Here's the door.,michael,6
26081,[dragging Meredith on the floor into the rehab center] Let's start meeting-- Hello. How are you?,michael,16
26084,I have a deposit.  Alcoholic.,michael,6
26086,So do I sign?,michael,4
26095,Well don't look so surprised.,dwight,5
26096,I knew it.,pam,3
26097,You did not know it.,jim,5
26098,I knew some of it.,pam,5
26099,Everyone knew some of it.,jim,5
26100,It's Christmas.,pam,2
26101,You knew it.,jim,3
26102,Thank you. I knew it.,pam,5
26103,She knew it.,jim,3
26107,"Sure. Dooo. Tough room. [chuckles] Come on. I just learned it.  Just so you know protocol is a little round of applause. But, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.",andy,34
26108,"[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I'm sorry, he's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?",pam,19
26109,"[heard yelling from the street] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!",michael,17
26110,"Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It's actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard.",pam,32
26111,[yelling as he runs past the radar gun] Aah!,dwight,9
26113,Yes!,dwight,1
26114,"No. No, no. There was wind.",michael,6
26115,I was just jogging.,dwight,4
26116,"Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.",michael,8

26627,Jan... Ryan.,michael,2

26635,Just something I have to do first.,michael,7
26636,Where are you taking the client list?,dwight,7
26637,"Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone [starts running, Dwight follows]",michael,11

26656,"Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?",dwight,8
26657,I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That's what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even... what's the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping?,michael,54
26658,"Oh, hey what is this?",michael,5

26707,What's next?,dwight,2
26713,"How about 911?  Anyone? 911. [Michael throws a chair at the window, Kevin smashes a chair through the vending machine and begins to grab snacks, everyone is shouting.]",dwight,29
26714,What do we do?,pam,4
26715,Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.,dwight,11

26726,What?!,jim,1

26742,"I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone.  Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days.",dwight,38
26744,"Yes I shouted 'fire!'.  I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--",dwight,37
26745,Hed. Hedded,michael,2
26746,When no one hedded--,dwight,4
26747,Take hedded of.,michael,3

26753,Take heed of.,michael,3

26756,"Okay. [walks to the window, sighs] This city.  Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed.",michael,18
26758,Yes. We are. We are livid.  But we are going to let this one slide.,michael,16
26760,"I am not a mind reader, David.",michael,7
26762,"Can you shove down?  Instead... shove down, please.  Instead, what I think we should do is strip of your title as safety officer.",michael,25
26763,No.,dwight,1
26764,And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice.  Something that Dwight doesn't like.,michael,23
26765,PETA.,dwight,1
26767,Do you?,michael,2
26769,You talking to me?,michael,4
26771,What?,michael,1
26772,Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. [chuckles] It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry?,dwight,37
26773,"[sighs] No, Dwight.  I am worried.  A man's life is in my hands.",michael,15
26774,Don't you worry about that.  I got it covered.  Okay?,dwight,12
26775,Yeah.,michael,1
26776,I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping.,dwight,13
26777,That's not gonna happen. I'm taking over as safety man.,michael,10
26778,What? You?,dwight,2
26779,Yes.,michael,1
26780,Come on.,dwight,2
26781,I'm a smart guy.  I'll figure it out.,michael,9
26782,That's preposterous.,dwight,2
26783,"No, I will.",michael,3
26784,"Nobody should have to go to work thinking, 'Oh, this is the place that I might die today.'  That's what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying.  An office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to... An office is a place where dreams come true.",michael,56
26785,"Shhh! Don't excite him. Don't make him excitable. [whispering] Welcome back, Stanley.",michael,12

26798,"No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet.",michael,20
26801,"Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means 'always be closing.'",michael,18
26802,This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.,dwight,10
26803,Shut it.  Shut it.,michael,5
26809,Absolutely I would not.,dwight,4
26810,You know who I really think should go? Stanley.,michael,9
26813,Come on.,michael,2
26815,No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working.  What are you gonna do if you're by yourself and your heart stops?,michael,38
26817,And you're okay with that?,michael,5
26819,"Uh-uh.  No, no, no.  Come on. Get up.  Let's do this.",michael,14
26821,Come on Stanley.  You're losing you.  You're losing you. Do it!,michael,13
26823,This is you we're talking about.,michael,6
26825,"Okay, okay.  I'll show them. Here we go. [whispers] Stanley.  All right.",michael,14
26827,"No, Rose. They are not breathing.  And they have no arms or legs.",michael,14
26829,"Where are they?  You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?",michael,34
26831,"How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything.",michael,20
26833,"okay, that's uh, hard to keep track.  How many is that per hour?",michael,14
26834,How's that gonna help you?,jim,5
26835,I will divide and then count to it.,michael,8
26836,Right.,jim,1
26838,"Yes, yes I do.  I love that song. [clears throat, begins to sing] First I was afraid, I was petrified.",michael,21

26843,"Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah...",michael,4
26844,"Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk. Music loud, women warm, been kicked around since I was born. Oh, it's alright, it's okay, [Michael and Kelly join in] you can look the other way. Loo do do!",andy,49
26846,"Da, da, da, da, da, da, da",andy,7
26850,"Okay, he's dead.  Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?",dwight,12
26852,Anyone else?,dwight,2
26854,"Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card.  If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest.",dwight,19
26856,He is an organ donor.,michael,5
26857,He is.,dwight,2
26858,Yeah.,michael,1
26859,Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. [pulls out knife from holder that is attached to his leg] Here we go.,dwight,22
26863,We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.,dwight,11
26865,"Hey, Stanley.",michael,2
26866,Stanley.,andy,1
26867,Are you okay?,michael,3
26871,Clarice?,dwight,1
26874,"I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic.",dwight,17
26876,Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?,michael,8
26877,Wow.,dwight,1
26878,"Okay, look. David, this is why we have training.  We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person.",michael,35
26879,"Hope you brought your appetitos.  My lady. My tuna. A little movie popcorn. [dumps popcorn in bowl, it's almost all seeds] Uh, damn it.  This movie, a lot of buzz.  Not coming out for another six months.  Mrs. Albert Hannaday. So, friendship with the Nard-dog has its privileges.",andy,52

26891,"Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.",jim,21
26892,My dad spent the night at our place last night.  My parents have been fighting for weeks and... it kinda sucks.  Jim's been great. But I'm gonna need to buy my dad a robe.,pam,36
26893,He's not saying what he needs to say.,pam,8
26894,Hmm? Who? Sam?,andy,3
26895,Yeah.,pam,1
26896,"I mean, they just need to communicate, you know?  If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then--",jim,23
26897,Hmm.,andy,1
26898,"Jim and Pam are, like, movie geniuses. They're catching things that are totally going over my head.",andy,17
26899,"Hi, everyone.  Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?",michael,39
26900,I have.,dwight,2
26901,Let's hear it.,michael,3
26902,[clears throat] 'I state my regret.',dwight,6
26903,You couldn't of memorized that?,jim,5
26904,"I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it.  Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal.",dwight,42
26906,"Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay?  Make a line. Just form a line right here.  Sign it!  Sign it now!",dwight,51
26907,"Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.",pam,10
26911,Gimme a break.,jim,3
26912,"I know it man. You know, Lilly was supposed to be Nicole Kidman, um and it was gonna be Sophie's mom, not grandmother. But then Nicole kidman dropped out so they went with Lily, with a small rewrite.",andy,38
26916,[to Pam] Can you believe this? [pause] He was pretty talkative at breakfast.,jim,13
26917,"Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don't think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?",andy,23
26918,So he doesn't share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter's fiance?,pam,16
26919,"You guys, they're making out.",andy,5
26920,Hey.,pam,1
26921,Hey.,jim,1
26922,"Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?",pam,9
26923,"Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal.",jim,8
26924,[sighs],pam,1
26925,What?,jim,1
26926,"I dunno. I mean, maybe he'll talk to you about some of this stuff 'cause he can't really talk to me about it.",pam,23
26927,Mmm...,jim,1
26928,You're good to talk to.,pam,5
26929,"[laughs] I'm ok, I'm not, great, and um... [nods]",jim,9
26930,[in a monk-impression tone] Ohmmm... Ohmmm... Everybody sit on the floor Indian style like me. [Meredtih sits Indian style in a dress exposing herself right in front of Michael] Ohmmm my God if you're wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm... ohmmm...,michael,49
26931,My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for Stanley Hudson as I can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds. [a couple of sounds play on the computer] That one makes me think... of death. It's kinda nice...,michael,51
26933,Don't open your eyes.,jim,4
26934,"What? [opens her eyes, Michael is standing over her] Oh...",pam,10
26935,"And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out.",michael,58
26937,Too expensive.,michael,2
26939,"Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want? [beeping starts] What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones.",michael,35

26953,Ok. [beeping slows down],michael,4
26955,"Ok... I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh... Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? That's what HE said! Right guys, 'cause of gay? [Oscar has Stanley's monitor now] Let's give this a shot.",michael,38
26956,Hellloo... [beeping speeds up as Michael gets closer],michael,8

26975,Si senor.,michael,2
26980,I can already feel people's stress starting to melt. I think they're very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.,michael,33

27020,"Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott. [laughter] He's supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.",pam,39
27021,"Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?",michael,9
27022,"Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small. [quickly walks off stage] If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle! [clapping, laughter]",pam,46
27023,"Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.",michael,37

27061,So what did he say? Was it my fault?,jim,9
27062,"Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best.",pam,58
27063,You ok?,jim,2
27064,Yeah. [they hug],pam,3
27065,"When you're a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them. [Andy is in the background, looks incredulous]",pam,42

27072,What?,pam,1
27075,"Andy, Cornell called, they think you suck. And you're gayer than Oscar. Boom. Roasted. [Stanley is still laughing] Alright. Alright everybody, you know I kid, you know I kid.

27138,"No, I'm not even wearing that much.",pam,7

27395,"I'm so sorry, Michael.",pam,4
27396,"How could she do this to me, Pam?",michael,8
27397,She's not doing it to hurt you.,pam,7
27398,"I can't do the presentation, I can't- [voice cracks] ... just... oh... thinking about seeing him... and... thinking about... him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her, it just- oh, God! [starts crying, covers his face]",michael,38
27399,"Listen, when Jim was dating Karen, I didn't want to come to work. It was awful. I hated it. I wanted to quit, but-",pam,24
27400,"I know, just... uh, please, I'm going through something, okay? [exhales]",michael,11
27401,"You know, when Holly gets back, everyone will tell her what a great job you did. And then she'll realize what she's missing.",pam,23
27402,And then she'll move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die.,michael,12
27403,"Yeah, maybe.",pam,2
27404,[laughs],michael,1

27428,"Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? 'Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face.",dwight,20
27429,You know what? I could use a little help.,jim,9
27430,You know what? I'm a little busy.,dwight,7
27431,"We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign?",jim,25
27432,It's not effeminate. It's festive.,dwight,5
27433,"You've been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party's now at 3!",jim,23
27437,A.J. What kind of name is A.J.?,michael,7
27439,What do you race cars?,michael,5

27444,"Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so you're dating somebody? Um... is it serious?",michael,15
27446,Huh- [pauses] Does she ever talk about me? [voice cracking],michael,10
27447,"Oh, God.",pam,2
27450,It's all connected. Shut up. [to A.J.] Does she ever mention 'Michael Scott?',michael,13
27452,[sighs loudly] Does it feel good?,michael,6
27454,"[grunts] Your life. [sits down, upset] Oh, wow. Whew. Ahh, legs are sorta giving out. Long drive in the car, so let's just- We'll just continue. [sighs, falls to floor, gets more upset] Oh, wow. [takes deep breath] Ooh, okay.",michael,40
27455,"Michael, get off the floor!",pam,5
27456,"Yeah, yeah... uh, I can't do this Pam. Just read from- just read the cards.",michael,15
27457,"[whispering] No, no, no, you have to do it-",pam,9
27458,"No, no, I'm okay. I'm all right. [sighs heavily] Okay... okay.",michael,11
27460,"[pointing to staff members] Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K.D. Lang. Holly's boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then, also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw! [holds up chainsaw, makes a wimpy chain saw noise] Cutting down the competition.",pam,44
27468,"[sighs, touches Holly's sweater, cuts off sleeve, chuckles, sees Word document on Holly's computer named 'Dear Michael,' plugs in USB flash drive to copy file from computer]",michael,27
27474,[loading up car with Michael] Don't look up. Don't look up. [sighs as office workers all looking from window],pam,19
27475,Want some pie?,michael,3
27476,No.,pam,1
27477,I went through Holly's things.,michael,5
27478,What?,pam,1
27479,I stole a sleeve of her sweater.,michael,7
27480,"Oh, Michael...",pam,2
27481,I also stole something off of her computer. A document called 'Dear Michael.',michael,13
27482,You did what?,pam,3
27483,I shouldn't have done it. It just- I couldn't help it.,michael,11
27484,She never sent it to you?,pam,6
27485,"No, sh- she didn't. I'm gonna read it.",michael,8
27486,No.,pam,1
27487,Yes.,michael,1
27488,"No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. It's a violation of her trust.",pam,15
27489,How?,michael,1
27490,"Because, she didn't send it to you!",pam,7
27491,"I know, I know. You're right, you're right.",michael,8
27492,I could read it.,pam,4
27493,"No, that wouldn't-",michael,3
27494,"Yeah, I could read it.",pam,5
27495,"No, you don't have to do that.",michael,7
27496,Go get your laptop.,pam,4
27497,Okay. [leaves to get laptop],michael,5
27498,[to camera] What? I'm not in love with her.,pam,9
27499,"[blowing up balloon, breathes loudly] You have to write my suggestions down, too.",dwight,13
27500,"I'm not writing, 'Horse Hunt.' I don't even know what that means.",jim,12
27501,It's in the name.,dwight,4
27502,"[grunts] Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.",jim,26
27503,"You're right, forget horse hunting. It's stupid.",dwight,7
27504,"Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?",jim,10
27505,"Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord. [pretends to bite]",dwight,34
27506,"Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one.",jim,17
27507,"Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. [rolls eyes] What about you?",dwight,31
27508,"Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.",jim,41
27509,"That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed.",dwight,16
27510,[to camera] Didn't see that one coming.,jim,7
27511,[closes laptop] It's deleted.,pam,4
27512,Well?,michael,1
27513,She still has feelings for you.,pam,6
27514,She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say?,michael,12
27515,"I can't tell you specifically, but... it's not over.",pam,9
27516,You're sure?,michael,2
27517,[nods and smiles],pam,3
27518,"[smiles, sighs, chuckles] Okay.",michael,4
27522,"Hey, it's not a surprise.",dwight,5
27523,Not a surprise.,jim,3
27525,"What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?",jim,15
27527,Told you.,dwight,2
27528,"You haven't heard our theme, though.",jim,6
27530,"That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.",jim,11
27531,"Our theme, if you will.",dwight,5
27532,"Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.",jim,19
27533,That's our theme.,dwight,3
27535,Yeah?,jim,1
27537,"[high-fives Jim] Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor?",dwight,12
27539,No.,dwight,1
27540,No.,jim,1
27548,All right.,jim,2

27551,"Move it! Let's go, go, go, go, go. I got this.",dwight,11
27552,"Ahem. This is for you... and [puts blanket around her shoulders] ...Happy Birthday, Kel.",jim,14
27554,"[turns off lights] Okay, you've got one hour. [shuts door]",dwight,10
27556,"Mm, great cake.",dwight,3
27557,Thanks. [both eat cake],jim,4
27558,"[opens door to wake Kelly, bangs together two trash can covers loudly] Birthday time is over! Now go make up for all the work you missed when you were taking your nap. [slaps Kelly's butt] Many happy returns. [slams door]",dwight,40
27559,I feel great. So good to have closure. Ah! We should go apologize to Roy or something.,michael,17
27560,"No, we don't need to do that.",pam,7
27561,"Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him!",michael,24
27562,You mean Tony?,pam,3
27563,"Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony!",michael,14
27564,"Oh, Michael.",pam,2
27565,"Man, was he fat. So, so... fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty.",michael,33
27569,"Good morning, can I help you?",pam,6
27571,"I'm sorry, he's not in right now.",pam,7
27573,Shoot.,pam,1
27574,"They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job.  But I'd like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone. [realizing] Vending machine.",pam,44
27576,That is a great idea.,pam,5
27578,"[while leafing through Michael's appointment book and seeing nothing but free time] Um, oh boy, let's see, he's really...",pam,19
27579,"[approaching Reception] Michael Scott, manager.  Hi, how are ya?",jim,10

27595,[laughing] What was that?,michael,4
27596,That was funny.,pam,3
27597,That was funny.  Let's go do it to somebody else.   Ayyyy!,michael,14
27598,"Oh, look at that.  Cupids and hearts. Really shoving our faces in it this year.  You doin OK, bud?",michael,21
27600,"Yeah, I hear ya.   It's been four months since I was with Holly, and she was way hotter then Stacy.  So if you think you're hurting...",michael,29
27602,This is our first and only Valentine's Day as fiances.,pam,10
27603,"You're only engaged once.  Well present company excluded, but.",jim,10
27604,"Really, Jim?  On Cupid's birthday?",pam,6
27605,Yeah.  [Jim leans in for a kiss but Pam turns away]  She's fine.,jim,15
27607,"Oh, wow look at those.  How nice for you.  Up there, front and center, beautiful.  I think they would look better right here.  [Michael takes the flowers from Pam's desk and puts them on the ground off to the side]  They're very pretty and I wouldn't want them to fall.  [Kevin groans]",michael,58
27609,"Pam, really, they're back?",michael,4
27610,I can't see them when they're on the floor,pam,9
27611,"They're for her to look at, Michael.",jim,7
27612,"Can I have a word with you, Jim?",michael,8
27613,"Yes, let's have a word.",jim,5
27614,"Yes, um, Jim.  Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office.",michael,18
27615,"Oh, I'm sorry.",jim,3
27616,"Yeah.  And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it's creating a bit of a hostile work environment.",michael,24
27617,I understand that.,jim,3
27618,So sexy it becomes hostile.,dwight,5
27619,Mm-hmm.,michael,1
27620,"Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.",jim,10
27621,"Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest--",michael,13
27622,We do.,jim,2
27623,--that none of us can be a part of--,michael,9
27624,"You can't be a part of our relationship, Michael.",pam,9
27625,"[gesturing Pam to be quiet] --then, we, are gonna have our own private Valentine's Day party.",michael,16
27626,That sounds fun.,jim,3
27627,"So suck it.   Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart's convention, this afternoon. Singles only.",michael,34
27628,"Yeah, deal with it Pam!",dwight,5
27629,"So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other.",michael,18
27630,Having trouble finding a vein?,dwight,5
27632,How about now? [Dwight untenses his arm],dwight,7
27633,"I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command.  Also, I can retract my penis up into itself. [pauses, then nods signaling that he performed the feat]",dwight,32
27634,"I am about to give blood.  The gift of everlasting life, the transfer of my bodily fluids, oh wow, that's a big needle, that --",michael,26
27636,Okay.  Hello.,michael,3

27640,"Yeah, me too.",michael,3
27642,"Oh, well, that's fine.",michael,4
27644,"Yeah, can I point something out to you?",michael,8
27646,You're actually talking a lot.,michael,5
27648,"Okay, here we go.",michael,4
27650,"Oh, God. [Michael clears his throat]",michael,6
27652,"Yup, I'm good, whew.  Wow, I feel like a human juicebox. [Blood Girl laughs] Hawaiian blood punch.",michael,18
27654,Type O-Ocean Spray.,michael,3
27657,What do you think?,pam,4
27658,I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.  Those mines aren't gonna sweep themselves.,jim,17
27659,We're in.,pam,2
27660,Yick.,michael,1
27662,I looked at the bag.,michael,5
27664,I looked straight at the bag.,michael,6
27666,"Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that don't have blood in them?",michael,17
27668,That was mean.,michael,3
27670,A hat.,michael,2
27672,That is full of soup.,michael,5
27674,What?,michael,1
27676,"Oh, already.",michael,2
27678,"Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I don't think I ate for three days. [Michael passes out]",michael,19
27680,"[ccming to] Oh my God, how long was I out?  [Michael looks over where Blood Girl was and sees Hank]",michael,21
27682,"Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?",michael,8
27684,"OK.  Oh, wait a second, wait a second, that's hers.   This is hers, she left her glove.  I need her name if I'm gonna return her glove.",michael,31
27691,Anything to get out of that office.,pam,7
27695,"Oh yeah, I understood.",jim,4
27698,"Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex. [Kelly looks hurt]  Okay, sorry, let's, who else?  Oscar.",michael,29
27700,"Come on, I'm sure there's something you need to get off your chest.",michael,13
27702,"If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure?  I'm sure whatever you did it wasn't your fault.  OK well, who else?",michael,23
27704,"No way, a 280?",jim,4
27705,"Wow,  that's impressive.",pam,4
27707,Yikes.,jim,1
27709,"No.  Bob, no. No!",jim,5

27715,"Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back.",pam,21
27716,But! That girl must've had monstrous hands because the holes fit.,jim,11
27717,"No, you just have little dainty fingers.",pam,7
27719,"Nobody asked, Bob!",jim,3
27724,"Moron, if he was there wouldn't be a story.",michael,9
27726,Really sad.,michael,2
27728,Oh my God.,michael,3
27730,"Well then it's a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him!",michael,14
27736,Alright who's next?  Where's Andy?,michael,6
27738,What?,michael,1
27741,You know what guys? I don't think we need to do this.,michael,12
27742,"You're right.  OK everyone,  back to work.",dwight,9
27744,A net? a giant net?,dwight,5
27745,No.  Not a giant net.,michael,6
27746,What do you have in mind?,dwight,6
27747,I was thinking maybe like a mixer.,michael,7
27748,"Oh God, that's a terrible idea.",dwight,6
27749,Old fashioned meet market --,michael,5
27750,No.,dwight,1
27751,-- I don't think it is.,michael,6
27752,"Lonely people mixing with one another?  Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation?  Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work.  Pssh.  You're like the guy who invented the seat belt.",dwight,36
27754,Hey.,michael,1
27755,Hey.  No movement.,dwight,4
27756,"Ah, still early.",michael,3
27757,"Eh, its not that early.",dwight,5
27758,[sighs] So how you holding up?,michael,6
27759,I'm ok.  Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.,dwight,19
27760,"No.  No, I meant about being single today.",michael,9
27761,Oh.  Meh.,dwight,3
27762,"Meh, exactly.  Eh.",michael,4
27763,Eh.,dwight,1
27764,"Oh, here we go.",michael,4
27765,Hello.,dwight,1
27766,"Hello. [two women, a blonde and a redhead, enter the office.  Michael and Dwight walk towards them and Dwight extends his hand to the redhead]",michael,26
27767,"Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend? [Dwight immediately breaks the handshake with the redhead and turns to the blonde]  Hi, Dwight.",dwight,28
27768,"Babe alert! [to the redhead]  Hello, I'm Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig.",michael,15
27770,"Lynn, follow me, come on in.  For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone.  Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.",michael,27
27773,"[after a short pause] So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev.  [after another pause] Where you from?",michael,20
27775,"Yeah, OK.  Well, he only gets better.",michael,8
27777,"I can untie any knot.  I'm serious.  Name a knot, any knot.  Go ahead.",dwight,17
27779,"You shouldn't believe everything you hear.  In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie.  So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.",dwight,36
27781,You must use a lot of paper.,dwight,7
27783,What's the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?,pam,11
27784,I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat.,jim,11
27785,"Oh, damn. [Pam looks down at her salad] They've been in there for like ten minutes.",pam,16
27786,Look at that.  Bob ordered hot food.,jim,8
27787,Yes.  And I think they gave him too many fries.,pam,11
27788,"We should help him out. [Jim and Pam each take a French fry, eat it, and then look toward the bathroom]",jim,21
27793,"So, Eric.  You mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair.",michael,14
27795,"Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so that's sort of a repair.  Alright, I'll let you guys talk.",michael,19
27796,"It's going very well.  People are mixing, a lot of hope.  Cause that's what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed. [Michael suddenly turns to look at the open entrance door] Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in.  Um, so [looking at his watch] it's not too late.",michael,52
27797,"...and the kind of discounts we're talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?",dwight,23
27798,No reason.,michael,2
27799,Is somebody after you?,dwight,4
27801,"Hey, it just takes one!",dwight,5
27802,"Nobody's after me, I just, I met a woman when I was giving blood and I thought she might come by.",michael,21
27804,"It's not a big deal really, I just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, I picked up her glove so I was hoping I could give it back to her.",michael,31
27807,"Oh, not likely.  3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up.",dwight,23
27810,"Believe me its nothing.  I hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, I think our blood bags touched.",michael,27
27812,Here they come.,jim,3
27813,[looking up from her pilfering of Bob's food] What?,pam,9
27814,"No, just kidding.  Seriously though, that's enough.",jim,8
27815,"Well, you should cover it with the broccoli.",pam,8
27816,"Oh great, I have to cover?",jim,6
27817,Do you think they dined and dashed?,pam,7
27818,"Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.",jim,10
27819,I thought we were having a nice time.,pam,8
27820,We were.,jim,2
27821,Yeah.,pam,1
27822,[emerging from the Men's room] Empty.,jim,6
27823,[exiting the Ladies' room] Mine too. [Pam and Jim notice the Handicapped stall and walk towards it.  Putting their ears to the door they hear Mr. and Mrs. Vance being intimate],pam,32
27824,Oh boy.,jim,2
27825,My God.,pam,2
27826,OK.,jim,1
27828,Nah. [everyone groans and Girl turns around and walks away.,michael,10
27830,So...,jim,1
27833,"Yep, that, yeah.",pam,3
27835,Oh initially I did.,jim,4
27847,"So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.",dwight,17
27849,"OK, what's up?",dwight,3
27851,"Oh-oh-oh before you go, I'd just love to get a firm commitment on this.  You know maybe sign--",dwight,19
27853,"OK.  Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot.  God!",dwight,12
27854,"Hey, you don't deserve her.",michael,5
27855,"Thanks, Michael.",dwight,2
27856,"Hey, if anybody wants to go...",michael,6
27858,"Really? [everybody signifies their agreement, and Kelly gives Michael a piece of cake]  Oh, thanks.",michael,16
27860,"You know what, you guys, you guys can get out I'm gonna soldier on a little bit.",michael,17
27862,[after some encouragement] OK.,michael,4
27868,"[on the phone] Yeah, that's no problem.",pam,7
27869,Pam?,michael,1
27870,[on the phone] Sure. Uh huh.,pam,6
27871,"Pam? Knock, knock.",michael,3
27872,I'm on the phone.,pam,4
27873,"I know you are. Knock, knock.",michael,6
27874,"[on the phone] You can fax it over. Yeah, 5-7-0-5-5-5-0-1--",pam,10
27875,[at same time as Pam] 4-9-1-7-4-5-1,michael,6
27876,"0-1-7-5. Thank you. Bye, bye. [to Michael] It really makes us look unprofessional.",pam,13
27877,"They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock. [Dwight walks over]",michael,17
27878,[sighs] Who's there?,pam,3
27879,Buddha.,michael,1
27880,Buddha who?,pam,2
27881,"[puts a slice of bread and stick of butter on Pam's desk] Buddha this bread for me, won't you? [Michael and Dwight laugh]",michael,23
27882,Great.,pam,1
27883,"I, I need something to wipe my hand.",michael,8
27884,"Now there's, there's butter on my desk.",pam,7
27885,That was helping. It was classic.,michael,6
27886,I got a knock-knock joke.,dwight,5
27887,No... God.,michael,2
27888,"OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.",dwight,9
27889,Alright.,michael,1
27890,"[clears throat] Knock, knock.",dwight,4
27891,Who's there?,michael,2
27892,KGB.,dwight,1
27893,KGB - [Dwight slaps Michael on the face],michael,8
27894,[in Russian accent] We will ask the questions!,dwight,8
27895,What the hell was that? [Michael starts to fight with Dwight],michael,11
27896,What are you doing?,dwight,4
27897,What are you doing?,michael,4
27898,Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it!,dwight,6
27899,"You, you like that?",michael,4
27900,C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.,dwight,13
27901,Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. That's it.,michael,13
27902,Ding Dong.,jim,2
27903,[to Jim] Who's there?,michael,4
27904,KGB.,jim,1
27905,"Dwight, get the door.",michael,4
27906,I'm not answering it.,dwight,4
27907,Answer the door.,michael,3
27908,Ding dong.,jim,2
27909,"No way, it's the KGB.",dwight,5
27910,Ding dong.,jim,2
27911,I'm not answering that. You answer it.,dwight,7
27912,I'm not gonna answer it,michael,5
27913,"I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB. [Jim slaps Dwight]",dwight,11
27914,The KGB will wait for no one! [Michael laughs],jim,9
27915,It's true.,dwight,2
27916,"[Michael walks in dressed as Willy Wonka] Good morning, Michael.",pam,10
27917,"Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa.",michael,13
27918,"Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages.",pam,8
27919,"Why thank you very much. [notices jelly beans] Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!",michael,18
27920,Jelly beans.,pam,2
27921,"No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!",michael,17
27923,"I've written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine. [Jim raises hand] Umm hmm.",michael,57
27924,We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --,jim,15
27925,Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.',michael,9
27926,Free paper.',jim,2
27927,No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.,michael,26
27928,"Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this...",andy,25
27929,"No, you don't. No, it - [sighs] What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?",michael,28
27931,No! No! No!,andy,3
27933,"[sighs] You're making it too easy for her. You're just conveying, 'Oh I like you just the way you are.'",andy,20
27935,Well that's not what we agreed on.,andy,7
27936,What are you doing?,jim,4
27937,Huh?,andy,1
27938,"[to Kevin] Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know.",jim,34
27939,No.,andy,1
27940,"You don't have to wait that long. I mean, you don't have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out.",pam,24
27941,You're asking him to give up all of his power.,andy,10
27942,What power?,jim,2
27944,"You can't let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. 'Oh I like your dress, but I'd like it more if you had prettier hair.'",andy,35
27945,That's psychotic. Do guys actually do that?,pam,7
27946,Well guys with girlfriends don't.,jim,5
27947,"That's low, Tuna.",andy,3
27948,"[on phone] Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. [puts hand on receiver and speaks to office] One of my clients found a golden ticket. [Michael screams in excitement] [Jim back on phone] Yup. No, congratulations. [Michael dances in background]",jim,43
27949,Woo hoo.,michael,2
27950,[on phone] I'll take that down right now.,jim,8
27951,Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips...,michael,11
27952,I'm on the phone.,jim,4
27953,...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?,michael,9
27954,[on phone] Hold on one second.,jim,6
27955,Invite them on the tour.,michael,5
27956,[to Michael] It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.,jim,8
27957,"Really? That's kind of a big client. [gets up and heads toward Oscar] Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?",michael,32
27959,Yeah?,michael,1
27961,Yeah.,michael,1
27963,"[on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't.",jim,29
27964,How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?,jim,11
27965,I thought I did. So...,michael,5
27966,OK...,jim,1
27967,Well no harm no foul.,michael,5
27968,...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.,jim,18
27969,"You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good.",michael,9
27970,Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot.,michael,5
27972,Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?,michael,26
27974,Irrelevant.,michael,1
27976,"OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?",michael,18
27977,My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea. [sighs] That... [sighs],michael,34
27978,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David. [Michael shakes his head to Pam] No, I'm sorry he's not back from the Civil Rights rally. I'll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial.",pam,39
27979,"When Michael's skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. 'Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ' 'An Obama fashion show. ' Whatever... that is. Or 'trapped in an oil painting.' I'm gonna save that one.",pam,44
27980,"Nobody panic. The good news is... they can't fire all of us, right?",michael,13
27982,"No, they can't.",michael,3
27984,"Oscar, you don't know what the hell you are talking about.",michael,11
27986,"Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so -",michael,31
27987,"So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too.",jim,20
27988,"Thank you, Jim is with me.",michael,6
27989,"Absolutely not, I'm mad at you.",jim,6
27990,Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.,michael,23
27992,"OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess. [Pam raises hand] Yes.",michael,18
27993,Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? [Pam's phone rings],pam,15
27994,Good one.,jim,2
27995,"OK, don't get that. Please? [Pam gets up to answer her phone]",michael,12
27997,That is not constructive.,michael,4
27998,"[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He's having a colonoscopy. Alright, I'll find out if he's out yet.",pam,22
27999,"[on phone] Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so--",michael,12
28001,How are you doing?,michael,4
28003,[reading from computer] My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.,michael,23
28005,"Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don't... I don't know.",michael,19
28007,I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.,michael,10
28009,You're breaking up.,michael,3
28011,"OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant.",michael,10
28013,Yes.,michael,1
28015,No.,michael,1
28017,[long pause] Yes.,michael,3
28018,"[Dwight walks in] Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.",michael,25
28019,That was your idea.,dwight,4
28020,"Woah, wow, who told you that?",michael,6
28021,You did. Several times. Over and over again.,dwight,8
28022,"[same time as Dwight] No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight.",michael,16
28023,[same time as Michael] You were dressed as Willy Wonka so...,dwight,11
28024,I'm not taking... I'm not taking...,michael,6
28025,Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't.,dwight,8
28026,"Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.",michael,13
28027,You don't keep a diary.,dwight,5
28028,Yes I do. You've just never seen it. [reading from diary] March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.,michael,24
28029,Hold that thought. [Dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns] [flipping through diary] March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.,dwight,37
28030,Why do you have a diary?,michael,6
28031,To keep secrets from my computer.,dwight,6
28032,"OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.",michael,27
28033,Impossible.,dwight,1
28034,"Yes, you did.",michael,3
28035,"I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math.",dwight,33
28036,What are you writing? [Dwight writes in diary],michael,8
28037,Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies.,dwight,15
28038,Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?,michael,14
28039,With all my heart.,dwight,4
28041,"All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.",jim,15
28043,I don't think Jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her.,pam,12
28044,"No, that is what I mean.",jim,6
28045,"[to Jim] Shush. [to Kevin] Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it's really romantic.",pam,25
28047,"No, stop it.",jim,3
28048,Don't touch her. Don't talk to her. Don't look at her.,andy,11
28049,"[Jim, Andy and Pam all talking over each other] ...turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that.",andy,35
28050,We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking--,michael,17
28051,"OK, what am I thinking right now?",dwight,7
28052,"Umm, nacho chips.",michael,3
28053,No... How skin is the largest organ of the body.,dwight,10
28054,"Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.",michael,20
28055,"Oh, not gonna happen.",dwight,4
28056,I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again.,dwight,18
28058,What about Shoe La La?,dwight,5
28059,[sighs] It's not ready yet.,michael,5
28060,"I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La La. And it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house.",michael,49
28061,"May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight.",michael,43
28063,"Yes they are, you just don't care about the information.",michael,10
28064,I love working here and I do not want to leave.,dwight,11
28065,He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired.,michael,17
28066,Well...,dwight,1
28067,"I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion...",michael,16
28068,We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.,dwight,16
28069,Right.,michael,1
28070,No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.,dwight,14
28071,That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom.,michael,11
28072,Try me.,dwight,2
28073,That's why you made the decision. That's why you made...,michael,10
28074,I haven't made a decision yet.,dwight,6
28075,You kind of have.,michael,4
28076,No.,dwight,1
28077,Yes.,michael,1
28078,You cannot take the fall for him.,jim,7
28079,He said he would do the same for me.,dwight,9
28080,He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?,jim,21
28081,I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.,dwight,13
28082,There it is.,jim,3
28085,"Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn't it?",michael,11
28087,David... you're welcome. [Dwight and David shake hands and make exclamations],dwight,11
28090,That's what she said! [David laughs],dwight,6
28091,"Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea?",michael,15
28092,Inspiration.,dwight,1
28093,Really? How did-- how are you inspired?  How did it pop into your head Dwight?,michael,16
28094,[same time as Michael] You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom.,dwight,13
28095,Give me the details of how that happened.,michael,8
28096,"You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years.",jim,23
28097,What?,michael,1
28098,And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.,jim,26
28099,Apology rejected.,dwight,2
28100,"[going up to give Dwight a hug] Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight.",pam,15
28101,Oh Pam.,dwight,2
28103,Thanks old man.,dwight,3
28105,Yeah.,dwight,1
28107,Sure.,pam,1
28108,David? David?,michael,2
28109,[same time as Michael] 'Cause I've got this idea...,dwight,9
28110,David?,michael,1
28112,Could I be a part of the meeting also?,michael,9
28114,"Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. [David laughs]",jim,19
28115,Alright.,dwight,1
28117,"OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka.",dwight,35
28120,So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea [Michael comes into conference room].,dwight,28
28121,There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.,michael,15
28122,It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.,pam,12
28123,Pam...,dwight,1
28124,I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.,michael,19
28125,That is my idea.,dwight,4
28127,"OK, here's what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it's a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that?",michael,50
28129,It is my idea.,dwight,4
28130,Oh how dare you.,michael,4
28131,It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.,dwight,13
28132,"You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?",michael,43
28133,Horse Boat.,dwight,2
28134,Oh please.,michael,2
28135,A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!,dwight,20
28136,Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge...,michael,7
28137,Oh give me a break.,dwight,5
28138,"...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas.",michael,16
28139,That's because they're easy!,dwight,4
28140,They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.,michael,10
28141,[same time as Michael] Women's urinals... uh...,dwight,7
28143,"Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.",dwight,13
28144,Thank You!,michael,2
28146,"Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame.",michael,18
28148,OK.,pam,1
28150,When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.,michael,46
28151,Oh I am. In my own words.,dwight,7
28152,I want to see it.,michael,5
28153,No.,dwight,1
28154,I want to see it. [Michael gets up to try to see Dwight's diary],michael,14
28155,"No, Michael.",dwight,2
28156,Give me...  Give me the diary.,michael,7
28157,No! [Michael struggles to take Dwight's diary from his hand],dwight,10
28164,"Well, it's uh, his funeral. So... neh!",andy,7
28165,Ding dong.,dwight,2
28166,Who is it?,jim,3
28167,KGB.,dwight,1
28168,"Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second.",jim,12
28169,"[in accent] When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there?",dwight,13
28170,"Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine.",jim,16
28171,We have more houses to visit.,dwight,6
28172,"If you want to come back then, that'll be fine.",jim,10
28173,We will come back at... how is [looks at watch] 4:45?,dwight,11
28174,I get back from work around 6.,jim,7
28175,How about 5:15?,dwight,3
28176,"You can try. That, that might work.",jim,7
28177,"Very well, we will come back at 5:15.",dwight,8
28178,Alright.,jim,1
28179,"Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause.",dwight,26
28180,I like it.,michael,3
28181,Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence.,dwight,8
28182,[wearing a tuxedo] I don't know. Is it classy enough?,jim,10
28183,"Jim! Enough with the classy, ok?",dwight,6
28184,"I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.",jim,27
28185,"I think you're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here.",michael,19
28186,"And of course, classy.",jim,4
28187,"And classy, yeah.",michael,3
28188,"Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?",dwight,18
28189,"Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously.",jim,23
28190,"Oh, here's one:  a string quartet, playing classy-cal music. [Jim grimaces]",dwight,12
28191,"[watches Jim grimace, copies him] You know, that's good but it's not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership.",michael,24
28192,That's it. Or Mr. Peanut.,jim,5
28193,Yes.,michael,1
28194,Mr. Peanut is not classy.,dwight,5
28195,He is.,michael,2
28196,"He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat.",dwight,18
28197,That's what makes him classy.,michael,5
28198,"Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.",dwight,14
28199,"Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind.",jim,23
28200,"Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then.",dwight,11
28201,"Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my head:  an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.",jim,36
28202,Strawberries?,michael,1
28203,That's inspired.,jim,2
28204,"I said that! [storms out, slams door behind him]",dwight,9
28205,Not classy.,pam,2
28206,Not classy at all.,michael,4
28207,De class'.,jim,2
28208,French. Classy.,michael,2
28209,"Hi, can I help you?",pam,5

28235,"Hey, how you doing? Jim Halpert, sales. Just wanted to say, if you need anything, let me know.",jim,18
28237,"I didn't think you'd notice. [laughs nervously] Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him.",jim,51
28239,"Oh, you'd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, there's probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh.",jim,42
28241,"Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it... [being pulled away by Pam]",jim,19
28242,He just had to wear his tux today.,pam,8
28243,I thought it'd be funny.,jim,5
28244,Took him 40 minutes to get ready.,pam,7
28245,"All right, let me introduce you to some of the troops. Accounting, front and center. Come on up here. I'd like you to meet somebody. This is the accounting department.",michael,30
28247,"Oh, nerd alert!",michael,3
28249,"This is Oscar Martinez. He is Latino. And he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man, Gil, who broke his heart. But he didn't bring any of that into work, it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and I am very proud of him for that.",michael,50

28282,Well-,michael,1
28283,What about your party?,dwight,4
28284,"Ok, ok, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesn't it? Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen. [starts round of applause] He has a long trip home. Thank you for coming in. We have to get back to work.",michael,50
28286,"Oh no, no, no. You don't have to do that. I've got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet.",michael,19
28288,I am thrilled that the new boss has taken such an active interest in all of the responsibilities that I'm supposed to have. Thrilled.,michael,24
28289,"[on speakerphone] David, it was my understanding that I was not going to be managed.",michael,15
28291,It was my understanding.,michael,4
28293,"Listen, why don't we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability.",michael,21
28295,But the branch is still mine?,michael,6
28297,Ask him about the party.,dwight,5
28298,"Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party?",michael,11
28300,No the other thing.,dwight,4
28301,"Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff? [several seconds of silence]",michael,23
28302,He hung up?,dwight,3
28304,"I just got off the horn with David Wallace, and he said that you and I should try to get to know each other better. And I agree, so what I would like you to do is tell me something that you've never told anybody before.",michael,46
28306,Come on. What's your wife's name? Where did you work before you came here?,michael,14
28308,"Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names.",michael,11
28310,You're not from paper?,michael,4
28312,Does David know this?,michael,4
28314,"Well that, actually, is an excellent segue into really what is my only point-",michael,14
28316,"And that- I-I don't need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, it's all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear?",michael,56
28318,"Ok, alright, well I'll just bounce that off David, see what comes back.",michael,13
28320,Whatever David wants.,michael,3

28338,"[to delivery men] Uh, hi, can I help you? I don't think anyone here-",pam,14
28341,Are you kidding me with this? On the day that I bring in breakfast?,michael,14
28343,"I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad.",michael,22
28347,Nobody thanked me.,michael,3
28348,"Thanks, Charles.",jim,2
28349,"For breakfast. Except Charles. You say no more parties, and then you spend all of this money on lunch, I think it's a little hypercritical.",michael,25
28351,"[on phone] Damn it, Stephanie, put me through to him. Is that him in the background? David? David! David, pick up the phone!",michael,23
28355,Yep.,michael,1

28378,"Duuudes, stop.",andy,2
28381,I'm gonna walk away.,michael,4
28382,Stop doing that!,andy,3
28383,"I'm kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, it's just a joke. It's fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's continue our morning meeting in the conference room.",michael,25
28384,"And then, out of that cake, pops another stripper holding a smaller cake. And then an even smaller stripper pops out of that one.",pam,24
28385,What is that smaller stripper holding?,michael,6
28386,Cupcake. It's cupcakes and strippers all the way down.,pam,9
28387,Ok.,michael,1
28391,"Party Planning Committee. Not your concern, Charles.",michael,7
28393,Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jim's? Go ahead.,michael,15
28394,"No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please.",jim,11
28396,You pet the animals and they pet you back.,jim,9
28397,It's a great idea. And we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay.,michael,17
28398,It's really just a regular shaped cake.,pam,7
28399,"But it's cool, and it's-",michael,5
28401,"Whoa. You're talking about my anniversary party, so. . .",michael,10
28403,"Yeah, why don't you do that?",michael,6
28405,"Yeah, here we go. Ok.",michael,5
28407,What?,michael,1
28409,Newsflash:  I've been here for fifteen years. Headline:  You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story!,michael,38
28413,Hey.,jim,1
28415,"Alright, Charles, I've gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, I'm a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker.  And a great number two for the office.",jim,39
28417,Second-in-command to Michael.,jim,3
28419,"Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me.",jim,35
28421,"Assistant regional manager, yeah.",jim,4
28423,"No, not exactly.",jim,3
28425,"Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that.",jim,13

28430,[points to bathroom door] So is this the meeting you've been in all day?,michael,14
28432,I drove.,michael,2
28434,"Cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party. Just pulled the rug out from under me. And he said no figs. I've already bought em. And I don't have a place to store them. So, I feel like I've been sort of boned.",michael,40
28436,"Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?",michael,21
28438,"Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.",michael,50
28440,Clearly that's what you wanted.,michael,5
28442,Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot.,michael,12
28444,I've put having a family on hold.,michael,7
28446,And I've never gone hang-gliding.  And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington.,michael,18

28476,"I had no idea when I got in that car and headed to New York I was going to quit.  I got on that ramp and I thought two hours, two hours to go.  Feeling good.  Listen to some tunes.  Should've peed before I left.",michael,49
28478,"Okay, so.  I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken!  So I have to take the normal door.",michael,25

28483,"Okay focus. Focus.  You're in the right building, you're with the right people; what happened?",pam,16
28484,I looked at Wallace and I said 'I quit!' and as I turned to leave I looked back and I said 'You have no idea how high I can fly.',michael,30

28702,Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.,jim,12

28747,"No. [Andy gets up from his desk] Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.",jim,18

28818,"I'm not overwhelmed, Pam.",michael,4
28819,"I know! No, I'm saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff.",pam,33

28825,"Michael, that seems impossible.",pam,4
28826,It's totally impossible!,michael,3
28827,We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.,pam,14
28828,Assemble a sales team. A dream team.,michael,7
28829,Great.,pam,1
28830,"Okay, Ryan.",michael,2

28845,Hey! We need to get you dressed!,pam,7
28846,"I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship. [Michael comes out in a suit] Hey! You look great! [checks something off her list] Let's go!",pam,53
28847,Alright.,michael,1
28848,[laughing at something on his computer],andy,6

28856,Ahhh. You bastard! That shoulda been me!,andy,7
28858,Cool!,andy,1
28859,"I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.",jim,41

28881,"Uh, no. Nope. Not really.",jim,5
28883,It's 'cause I'm more of a player.,jim,7
28885,You bet.,jim,2
28886,"Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it.",dwight,16
28887,Well I do.,jim,3

28980,By wanting it more. By working hard-,michael,7
28982,Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows: I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee.,michael,27

29026,"Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup. [to Pam] Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that.",michael,54
29027,I can't do this.,pam,4
29028,What's that?,michael,2
29029,I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.,pam,36
29030,Blech.,michael,1
29031,"I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?",pam,29

29035,"How come out of everyone in the office, I'm the only one that went with you? Is it because I'm that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn't even believe in you!",pam,32
29036,"I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.",michael,54
29037,Yeah.,pam,1

29040,"I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That's what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up.  She was the man. Don't think a woman can be a man? Well, then that's your stereotype, not mine.",michael,49
29041,[walks into room] Okay.,michael,4

29058,"You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?",jim,9
29063,"The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says 'You wanted me' enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had.",jim,55
29071,We are in the heart of it. [Bathroom sounds rattle the small office.] And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.,michael,25

29075,"I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service. [He sets sheet between Pam and Ryan on desk. Neither takes it.]",michael,32
29076,"I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day I'm receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And it's cold in there. Cause it's technically a closet.",pam,50
29077,What do you think?,andy,4
29078,Let me check. [Pulls out hunting scope] Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.,dwight,20
29079,Thank you!,andy,2
29080,"Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much.  But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do.",dwight,52
29082,Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.,michael,12

29091,When did you need that rundown by?,jim,7
29093,Okay.,jim,1
29095,"Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon. [At door.] Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?",jim,31
29097,You know there's a ghost in this office,dwight,8
29099,A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.,dwight,16

29103,Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.,dwight,16
29105,It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?,dwight,18
29107,"That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next.  [Taps her shoulder]",dwight,19

29118,Hey buddy.,dwight,2
29119,Hey Ryan? [Ryan watches Montgomery Flea Market ad on YouTube] Could you get to that copy from before?,michael,18
29121,That is so insulting.,pam,4
29123,"Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times.",pam,18
29125,Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.,pam,13

29518,"Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.",michael,19
29519,And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!,dwight,15
29520,"Oh. [bites into sandwich, looks disgusted] Bastard!",michael,7
29521,"Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is [reading off rolodex card] Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say.",dwight,41
29522,"[holding up rolodex card] Schrute comma Dwight. And on the back he wrote, 'great salesman, better friend.' [turns card over] 'Tall' and 'beets.'",dwight,23
29523,"And say hello to Cheri, who is your black wife. [hangs up and answers cell phone] I see you're begging for mercy, huh?  Well, you will find none here.",dwight,30
29524,"Dwight, do you mind if we talk?",michael,7
29525,Sure. That'd be fine.,dwight,4
29526,"If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed.",michael,13
29527,This is war and that is what happens.,dwight,8
29528,"Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.",michael,16
29529,"Oh, no. No. No. No. No.",dwight,6
29530,"Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now.",michael,9
29531,Michael! Michael!,dwight,2
29532,"You can hear me, but I can't hear you.",michael,9
29534,"Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much.",michael,12
29535,Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!,dwight,8
29536,Walking in the door...,michael,4
29538,"Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I'm closing the door. [Dwight runs out of the office]",michael,17
29539,"[on speakerphone in Dwight's car] Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn.",michael,27
29541,"Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.",michael,33
29542,Are you saying you invented paper?,dwight,6
29543,"[hugging a crying Jim] Okay, okay.",andy,6
29544,"Oh, God.",jim,2
29545,"Okay, Tuna.",andy,2
29547,Hey.,jim,1
29548,Hello.,andy,1
29549,"Excuse me, can I have your attention, everyone? Here's the deal, everybody, Jim Halpert is very upset and disturbed. I don't know if it was something you did, something you said, a look you gave him, maybe it was nothing at all, but here's the deal, ok? It stops now.",andy,50
29552,"Oh, really?",andy,2
29554,Okay.,jim,1
29555,"Yeah, okay, what the heck is happennin' here?",andy,8
29556,"Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together.",jim,15
29557,"Uh, that's not what was-",andy,5
29558,"And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.",jim,33
29559,"Oh man, he got me so good. I learned something about myself today. Yeah. I wish this was a sofa, cause I feel like I could sit here and talk for hours.",andy,32
29560,What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?,michael,19
29561,It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah! [runs into office],dwight,20
29563,Spin move.,dwight,2
29565,"Ha ha! April 13th, 2002.",dwight,5
29567,That's very rude.,michael,3
29568,"I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.",dwight,37
29570,"La la la! Continuing.  Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!",dwight,23
29571,"I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin...",michael,43
29572,Come on.,dwight,2
29573,"Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.",michael,31
29574,What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you.,dwight,11
29576,That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.,michael,19
29578,"Good, good, good. I will see you.",michael,7
29579,"Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son?",dwight,18
29581,"I color code all my info. I wrote 'gay son' in green. Green means go, so I know to go ahead and shut up about it. Orange means 'Orange you glad you didn't bring it up?' Most colors mean 'Don't say it.'",michael,42
29582,"How is Tom, the homosexual sophomore?",dwight,6
29584,"He gives me leads and I take the leads from him and in exchange it makes him feel good. And if a friend can't make you feel good, then I don't want any friends. Except Dwight, because he is our only source of fertile leads.",michael,45
29585,Dwight just got Howard Family Dry Cleaners.,michael,7
29587,He's undercutting us big time. He's actually taking a loss and paying the difference out of pocket.,michael,17
29589,When are you ever responsible for your actions?,pam,8
29591,"Hey, hey, hey. Something about that seems inappropriate.",michael,8
29592,Betrayal ain't just a river in Egypt.,michael,7
29593,"Who is that knocking on my taste buds? Why, it's Mr. Lemon. Hmmm, nice to meet you.",andy,17
29594,It's good. But won't it feel weird cutting into a cross?,pam,11
29595,"Don't think of it as a cross in the Judeo-Christian sense, think of it more as a symbol of your lives crossing in marriage.",andy,24
29596,"When I think of it like that, I do not think of the other connotations.",jim,15
29597,Yes!,andy,1
29598,"I don't think so, Andy.",pam,5
29599,Sorry. Her day.,jim,3
29600,"Hey, bud.",andy,2
29601,Are they looking at me?,jim,5
29602,Who?,andy,1
29603,Everyone. Everyone just keeps looking at me.,jim,7
29604,Are you sure?,andy,3
29605,"Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew!",jim,10
29606,"It's 4:30 in the morning.  Do you know where your kids are?  If you are Ryan's parents or Pam's parents or my parents, you do.  They're gonna be in this van.  With me.  Who am I?  Nothing to fear.  I am just a 44 year old guy with a paper route.",michael,58
29607,"[honking horn] Time to make the donuts. [laughs and drives away as Ryan tries to get in the van]  Come on.  Whoa! No, I promise I won't do it again.  Come on.  [does it again] De-nied!",michael,40
29609,"Hello! Time to make the donuts!  Oh, Halpert! Whoa! Boner patrol. Arrest that man! Your donuts make me go nuts!  [laughs] Hey Pam.",michael,25
29610,We got the van at a used car lot.  We think it says 'Alleluia Church of Scranton.' in Korean.  It was either this or an old school bus with an owl living in it.,pam,36
29611,"You didn't happen to bring any coffee, did you, Michael?",pam,10
29612,Milk and sugar.,michael,3
29613,"Oh, awesome.  You're a life saver.  [drinks from coffee cup] Wait, is this just milk and sugar?",pam,19
29614,That's what I said.,michael,4
29615,Do you drink this every day?,pam,6
29616,Every morning.,michael,2
29617,"We're, uh, we're doing okay.  A couple weeks in and, um, we're having fun.  Uh, yep.  We have 20-- of those.",michael,24
29618,"[an Asian lady tries to enter the van] Oh, oh, excuse me!  Sorry. Sorry, no.  It's, uh, it's a paper company now.  It's not for the church.",pam,30
29620,"Oh, they're my client.",jim,4
29622,"[sighs] Shame, Jim.  I expected more.",dwight,7
29626,"Hey, Boss. Uh, I'd just like to point out that I have been here less time than these guys.",andy,19
29628,I just think the bar should be lower for a newbie.,andy,11
29630,I don't want to have said that.  But I think it's important that you know it.,andy,17
29632,It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired.,dwight,12
29636,"Been there, done that.",dwight,4
29637,You know what we need?  We need some couches in here.,michael,12
29639,"Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft.",michael,13
29640,Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?,pam,11
29641,"Like in a dorm room.  You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top.  You can sleep up top.",michael,23
29642,"Yeah, I know what a loft is.",pam,7
29644,Most do in the magazines.,michael,5
29646,We should look into that.  Or we just go for the loft.,michael,13
29648,"Hey, David.",jim,2
29649,"David Wallace! Hello, we've been expecting you, David Wallace.  Charles and I were waiting for you.",dwight,17
29656,"[makes kissing, puckering sound]",jim,4
29676,"Come along, afterthought.",dwight,3
29677,How much can we afford to pay a delivery guy?,michael,10
29679,"They are correct, sir.",michael,4
29681,Okay. A lame attempt at humor.  Swing and a miss.,michael,11
29683,Lowest in town.,michael,3
29685,Corporate greed?,pam,2
29690,"Okay, sure. Right, so-- why don't you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is.",michael,22
29693,Explain that.,michael,2
29695,"Well, we don't--",michael,3
29697,"Whatever, yeah.",michael,2
29699,Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.,michael,10
29701,"Okay, okay.  Hold on, hold on.  Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again.",michael,18
29703,Just crunch 'em.  Just crunch 'em please.,michael,8
29705,Did it help?,pam,3
29706,"Hi, Jerry.  Michael Scott.  Well, this is slightly embarrassing. [laughs] Um, I'm going to have to... ask you to pay me a little bit more money for that delivery we dropped off yesterday.  Yeah. We did. We got the check, but we're just going to need a much, much bigger check.",michael,54
29707,"When a child gets behind the wheel of a car and runs into a tree, You don't blame the child.  He didn't know any better.  You blame the 30-year-old woman who got in the passenger seat and said, 'Drive, kid.  I trust you.'",pam,46
29708,"Now, would corporate approve a temporary price reduction for returning customers?",jim,11
29710,"Stupid.  Yeah, makes us look weak.",dwight,7
29712,I say we fill Michael's office with bees.  My apiarist owes me a favor.,dwight,15
29713,Really? Does he do good work or--,jim,7
29714,"[scoffs] No, Jim. I use a bad apiarist. [sighs]",dwight,9
29716,Five minutes exactly.,dwight,3
29718,Sure thing.,dwight,2
29720,[opens phone] Hey. I saw you called.,jim,7
29721,You're just out of business?,jim,5
29722,We have maybe a month.  I don't know what I'm gonna do.,pam,13
29723,"Oh, yeah, well don't worry about it.  We'll figure it out.  We'll be okay.",jim,16
29724,That's what Michael said.,pam,4
29725,"Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.  [cell phone rings; Dwight's voice saying 'Idiot, Idiot, Idiot'] Oh, that's my new 'Dwight' ring.",jim,25
29726,I like it.,pam,3
29727,"Good, right?  Hello.",jim,4
29728,"[over phone] Idiot, we're starting back up.  This is Dwight, by the way.",dwight,14
29729,"Oh, okay. [kisses Pam] Don't worry about it.",jim,8
29730,Did I ever tell you about the day that Steve Martin died?,michael,12
29731,"Steve Martin's not dead, Michael.",pam,5
29732,I know.  But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life.  I was wrong.  It's this.,michael,28
29733,You want to hear something sad?,pam,6
29734,I would love that.,michael,4
29735,"So Jim and I are getting married and the wedding's really expensive.  So I tried to get a job on the weekends to earn extra money.  I applied to Old Navy, Target and Wal-mart.  None of 'em called me back.  Not even for an interview.",pam,49
29737,Really?,pam,1
29739,Was it nice?,michael,3
29741,I love Pad Thai.,michael,4
29743,No.  There's a lot I haven't done.,michael,8
29744,"Now, this is the projection over three months?",jim,8
29746,"Let me float something out there, okay?  Can I just say-- can I say something?",dwight,16
29748,"There is a hive of bees outside the front door.  We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.",dwight,30
29751,"Oh, but you didn't.",jim,4
29752,"Oh, Man!  If only Michael had children.  That's how you really apply the pressure.",dwight,16
29755,"Oh, I don't know. You know, they've taken a good deal of clients, so--",jim,14
29757,I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.,jim,20
29758,"You know what?  Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me.  I'm the man for this job.  Charles, you got my back on this?",dwight,28
29760,"Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit.",jim,11
29761,[knocking on door] Hmm?,michael,4
29762,"Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second?",jim,10
29763,"We're not hiring, Jim.",michael,4
29764,Actually here for something else.,jim,5
29765,"Listen, I can't make you laugh right now.",michael,8
29766,"You know I love a good guessing game, but why don't I just tell you what I'm here for?  Turns out you guys have made a pretty big dent in the Dunder Mifflin sales.",jim,35
29768,David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.,jim,22
29769,Seriously?  Are you being serious?,pam,6
29771,"Jim, what you don't understand is that this company's worthl--",michael,10
29772,Oh!,jim,1
29773,No-- We don't have--,michael,4
29774,Oh!  See I'm here to learn as little information as possible.  All I really need to hear is if your incredibly successful company would be receptive to a buyout.,jim,31
29775,[stammers] Uh... Yes.,michael,3
29776,Yes.,pam,1
29778,Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.,jim,11
29779,"Yes, well, we're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.",michael,10
29780,Missed the last part.,jim,4
29781,That's a pun.,michael,3
29782,Got it.,jim,2
29783,Yep. Oh... wow.,michael,3
29785,Of course not.,michael,3
29787,"Nope, nope, nope.",michael,3
29788,"Just to reiterate, none of us is going to say anything that might indicate that we are going broke.",pam,19
29789,"Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we're broke.",michael,17
29790,"Oh, I'm really worried that I'm going to say it.",michael,10
29791,"No, Michael.",pam,2
29792,Ah...,michael,1
29794,We have to come from a position of strength.,pam,9

29798,Hello.,michael,1
29800,"Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace.  I believe we're expected.  [David and Charles walk out of conference room] Well, well, well. How the turntables...",michael,29
29802,And we are prepared to reject that offer.,michael,8
29804,Never accept their first offer.  What is your second offer?,michael,11
29806,Are you kidding me?  That is insultingly low.  I don't even want to hear what your first offer was.,michael,21
29812,[stutters] We'll have to talk--,michael,5
29815,Mm-hmm.,pam,1
29816,Just amongst ourselves.,michael,3

29819,"$60,000.00",pam,1
29820,We are so rich.,michael,4
29821,Are you kidding me?,pam,4
29822,"Well, Jerry, the one who got away.  May I ask why you're leaving the Michael Scott Paper Company?  Really?  Please hold.  [gets up and runs to kitchen]  Charles.",dwight,33
29824,May I have your attention?  The Michael Scott Paper Company is broke.,dwight,13
29826,They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money.  That can only mean one thing.  They're desperate.  Which can only mean one thing.  They're total failures.,dwight,35
29827,Great work Dwight.,jim,3
29828,Quiet you.,dwight,2
29829,"No, I mean, great detective work.  'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?",jim,18
29830,"You don't crack a case.  That has pejorative connotation.  That's like calling a policeman a cop.  You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty.",dwight,28
29832,What are your top five cases?,jim,6
29833,I'm gonna answer Charles first.,dwight,5
29834,Because you've solved zero cases.,jim,5
29835,"Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit.  Missing beets from all over the farm.  No footprints. Inside job.  Mose in socks.  Boom, case closed.",dwight,28
29837,Done.,dwight,1

29845,No.,michael,1
29846,Can you give us another minute please?,pam,7
29849,Michael.,pam,1
29851,Why are you assuming you'd get the whole thing?,pam,9
29852,"It's a lot of money, okay.  But we need money coming in every week.  We need jobs.  Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?",michael,30
29854,"No, Michael's right.  Jobs are safer.",pam,7
29855,Agreed?,michael,1
29856,"Agreed.  But that's all, okay.",pam,6
29858,"Shut up, shut up.  Hello?",michael,6
29859,I want my old job back.  I want my old parking space back.  I want a Sebring.,michael,19
29861,And I want Charles gone.,michael,5
29864,I need him gone.,michael,4
29866,"Okay, then I want Pam back.",michael,6
29868,Sales.,michael,1

29878,And dental this time.,michael,4
29880,These are our demands.,michael,4
29882,"Our company is worth nothing.  That's the difference between you and I.  Business isn't about money to me, David.  If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company.  And  then another and another and another.  I have no shortage of company names.",michael,52
29884,That's one of 'em! Yes.  These are our demands.  This is what we want.  Our balls are in your court.,michael,23
29886,Can we have the room please?,michael,6
29889,Alright!,pam,1
29890,Yes! Can you believe it?  That's what I'm talking about!,michael,11
29893,"No, no. You're done.",michael,4
29895,"Someone is returning!  He started his own company, and now he's back.  Who could it be? I'll give you a hint.  He is a man.  A man you have missed with all your heart.  A man who has ruined all other men for you.  Who is it?",michael,53
29897,[whispering] Who is it?,pam,4

29906,Can you give us a hint?,jim,6
29908,"Oscar, what were you going to say?",michael,7
29910,All right.,michael,2
29912,"Not important. [everyone mutters] Okay, alright.  Yes. Yes, you have a job.  Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen.",michael,29
29913,"Wait, what?",dwight,2
29915,"It's going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and--",michael,23
29917,"Yeah , aren't we getting those clients back?",dwight,8
29918,"No, you lost those clients.",michael,5
29919,"I call foul, sir.",andy,4
29920,Okay.,michael,1
29921,You were bought out.  So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients.,dwight,16
29922,"Okay, Dwight.  Let me explain something to you.  I set the rules and you follow them.  Blindly. Okay?   And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department.  It's a trash can.",michael,44

29946,When held over heat the invisible ink will reveal that everyone should meet at the warehouse immediately.  Do not ask me where I got the invisible ink.  Urine.  It was urine.,dwight,34

29954,What are you still doing not at your desk?,andy,9
29955,Did you even read the memo?,dwight,6
29956,All my files are now in reverse alphabetical order--,andy,9
29957,"No, you idiot.  There is a code embedded in the memo.  Listen, you need to round up all the salesmen, except for Ryan and Pam, and get them down to the warehouse pronto.",dwight,35
29958,"Oh, it is on like a prawn who yawns at dawn.",andy,11
29959,"Stop doing rhyming poetry.  Just tell them, please.  God, the simplest thing.",dwight,14
29960,"We're in crisis mode here, do you understand?  The two unqualified so-called salespeople are being favored because they all failed together.  And frankly, I'm not convinced that Michael and Pam didn't have a thing going while they were gone.",dwight,41
29961,Can I address that?,jim,4
29962,"No, you're too close.",dwight,4
29963,Okay.,jim,1
29964,"Stanley, how do you feel about those two taking your clients?",dwight,11
29966,He doesn't like it.,dwight,4
29968,"Her face is okay, but-- Jesus!  What --what are you doing here?",dwight,13
29970,Get out!  We need to do something.  I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage.,dwight,19
29972,"No, I'm not saying we do those things.  I'm saying something like those things.",dwight,15
29973,Of course.  What is like a hostage?,jim,8
29974,Excellent question.,dwight,2
29975,We could write a strong-worded letter.,andy,6
29976,Words will never be enough.,dwight,5
29977,Strongly-painted picture.,jim,2
29978,"No, pictures are too interpretive.",dwight,5
29979,"Can I just say something?  I know that tempers are high, but I think the best way to handle this might be to just talk to Michael directly.",jim,29
29980,"Oh.  Well, that--that's a great idea, Jim.  Oh, I totally see your point.  Okay, we'll talk to Michael directly.  So uh,  meeting is over, I guess.  I'll see everyone upstairs.",dwight,36
29981,Great.  See you upstairs.,jim,5
29982,"C'mon. [whispers]  Guys. Psst, listen.  Now is the time for action.  I'm talking action--",dwight,17
29983,That one's great.,pam,3
29984,I know.,michael,2
29986,I do?  Well--Where is that bowl?,michael,7
29987,"Hey, you have a second?",jim,5
29988,Michael Scott Paper Company only.,michael,5
29989,"Yeah, I think you're going to want to cool it with that 'cause it's starting to upset the other salesmen.",jim,20
29990,"Okay, well---",michael,2
29992,"I will--no, no.  I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.",michael,16
29993,"This is awkward to talk about, but there may or may not be--but definitely is--a mutiny  forming in the warehouse right now.",jim,23
29994,Against who?,michael,2
29996,What?,pam,1
29998,"The old Michael Scott might have taken this, but not the new Michael Scott.  They are in for a bitter surprise.  I am not to be truffled with.",michael,30
29999,"Six weeks ago, none of these people wanted to come with me.  You two were the only ones with the stones to follow.",michael,24
30000,Mm-hmmm.,pam,1
30001,"That was  us, right there.",michael,6
30002,We were something else.,pam,4
30004,Mm-hmm.,michael,1
30006,"Yeah, the Commish.",michael,3
30008,"Yeah, yeah. The Shield.",michael,4
30010,"I know.  Yeah, it's...kinda--",jim,5
30012,That's true.  That's right.  Yeah.,jim,7
30014,Hey gang. Where you been?,michael,5
30015,Lunch.,dwight,1
30016,Where'd you eat?,michael,3
30018,"What'd you have, Stanley?",michael,4
30019,"I had a salmon salad.  With water, no ice.  I was going to get a soda, but the waiter talked me out of it.  Her name was Flo, she had black hair.",andy,35
30021,"So since you guys already ate, you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you?  [walks into kitchen] Oh, wow, Stanley.  Is that egg salad?  Andy brought some salmon.",michael,37
30023,"Dwight, is that a meat sandwich?  You guys hungry?",michael,10
30025,I'm going to o have some of this meat sandwich.,michael,10
30026,It's pony.,dwight,2
30027,Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?,michael,9
30028,Dijonnaise.,andy,1
30029,"Mmm.  Thanks for going out, guys.",michael,7
30030,Mmm.,pam,1
30043,"Well, what if I just do this?",jim,7
30045,I'm just hiding out until all this stuff blows over.  With Creed. Playing chess. At work.  He's winning.  I feel like I'm describing a dream I had.,jim,30
30047,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Give me the phone.  Give me the phone.",dwight,16
30049,That's my client.,dwight,3
30051,Give me the phone.,dwight,4
30053,Give me the phone.  Tell him Dwight Schrute wants to talk to him.,dwight,14
30055,"Hi, Mr. Bart.",dwight,3
30057,"Hey, it's Dwight here.  Give me the phone.",dwight,9
30059,"Dwight Schrute here.  Hey, don't hang up.",dwight,8
30061,"I know times are tough right now,  and I laud your thriftiness. [tries to pull phone out of Ryan's hand] Ryan!",dwight,22
30065,Ah! Mr. Bart!  Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account.  He was my client for ten years!,dwight,23
30066,"You made him lose the account by screaming at him the entire time.  It's okay, Ryan.",pam,17
30067,You're a secretary! What do you know?,dwight,7
30069,And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone.   I'm confiscating this.,dwight,14
30070,"Hey, hey guys.  You know what I want you to do?  Shake hands, get over it.  That was not a shake, Dwight.",michael,25
30071,"We want our clients back or we quit, Michael.",dwight,9
30072,Who quits?,michael,2
30075,Me too.,andy,2
30076,You guys gotta be kidding.,michael,5
30077,"No, we gotta be deadly serious.  We'll start our own paper company.  The Schrute-Bernard-Lapin-Vance...Stanley Paper Company.",dwight,18
30080,Yes I do.,michael,3
30081,That's completely backwards.,andy,3
30082,It's frontward's.,michael,2
30085,Right.,dwight,1
30087,"No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong.  And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways.  From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others.  And the bottom line, I am in the wrong.  I'm the bad guy.",michael,52
30088,I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.,michael,18
30089,Gasp.  Are you talking about a secret meeting?,dwight,9
30090,Whatever you guys did earlier.,michael,5
30091,I don't know that first things about secret meetings.,dwight,9
30092,"Just do it, okay?",michael,4
30093,I'll do--,dwight,2
30094,Get 'em there.  Get 'em there.,michael,7
30095,I'll do the best I can.,dwight,6
30096,Are you kidding me?,michael,4
30097,Deceit does not come easy to me.,dwight,7
30098,"Okay, okay, okay.",michael,3
30102,"So from the bottom of my heart to the top of my heart, I am sorry.",michael,16
30104,"If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say,  'apology accepted', I think we would all feel better.  And then we can break out  my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark.",michael,39
30106,They wouldn't make it unless people liked it.,michael,8
30108,"Okay.  If I give you your clients back there won't be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.",michael,29
30110,"Fine, have your clients.  I can see that's what you wanted all along.  [everyone mutters 'okay'] However, I rescind my apology.",michael,23
30111,That's fair.,dwight,2
30112,You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.,michael,10
30115,He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now.  He'll make his decision by the end of the day.,pam,22
30117,Oh.  I think you should get it.  You've changed a lot and you'd be good at it.,pam,19
30119,Yeah.,pam,1
30122,"Oh, I'm engaged to Pam.",jim,5
30124,Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?,jim,12
30126,Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?,michael,9
30127,Sure.  Let me just finish this turn.,jim,8
30128,[puts Scrabble pieces on board] And Bingo was his name.  Let's go.,michael,13
30130,I need your help.  This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.,michael,14
30131,"I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan.  You know that.",jim,17
30132,You're close with Pam too.,michael,5
30133,"Eh, she's nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.",jim,18
30134,"Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice.",michael,13
30135,"Well, that's--",jim,2
30136,I like his hair.,michael,4
30137,"Cons, Ryan.  He defrauded the company.  He has never made a sale.",jim,14
30138,Okay.,michael,1
30139,He definitely stole my iPod.,jim,5
30140,That sounds pretty biased.,michael,4
30141,You didn't hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.,jim,15
30142,"Okay. Pam, pros.",michael,3
30143,Mm-hmm.,jim,1
30144,"I like her.  I think that she is a fast learner.  Cons, she doesn't always follow through.  Sh--New York and the whole art school thing.  And Roy.  She has a weird voice.",michael,37
30145,That's not true.,jim,3
30146,I don't need to tell you that.,michael,7
30147,I think she'd be a really good salesperson.,jim,8
30148,"I don't think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven't said one bad thing about Pam.",michael,18
30149,And I won't.,jim,3
30150,"Okay.  So be it, then you've lost credibility.  And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan.",michael,21
30151,"All right.  You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But that's not a weird voice.",jim,23
30152,"Oh, wow!  Whoa!",michael,4
30153,Take it easy.,jim,3
30154,"Ho-ho, man!  Wow. [in a high-pitched voice] Honey!  I want you to bring the garbage out.  'Cause I'm not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba--",michael,34
30155,I have a very difficult decision to make.  It's like last week I was at the video store.  Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie's Choice?  It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.,michael,48
30156,"You don't understand clothing, Toby.  You're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki.",andy,14
30158,"Listen up, Flenderson.  You're being weak and ineffectual.  I'm cowboying this meeting, okay?  Here are the new rules.  Earth tones only.  Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.",dwight,33
30160,No.,dwight,1
30162,That's debatable.,dwight,2
30166,You're running from the problem.,andy,5
30168,"Pam, can you come in here, please?  Have a seat.  [clears throat] Well, there's no easy way of saying this.  So I think I will just...drag it out.  Since the dawn of time there has been--",michael,40
30169,Just tell me.,pam,3
30170,I gave Ryan the sales job.  There just weren't enough clients for the two of you.  So I had to--,michael,22
30171,"No, okay.",pam,2
30172,"I'm sorry, sorry.",michael,3
30173,"Okay, I get it. [Michael laughs] Why are you giggling?  Is this a joke?  [Michael continues to laugh] Michael, is this-- did I get the job?",pam,28
30174,"[laughing] Yes, you did.",michael,4
30175,I did?,pam,2
30176,Yep.,michael,1
30177,"For real, you're not kidding?",pam,5
30178,"No, you--no.",michael,2
30179,I did?,pam,2
30180,"No, you're the best person for the job.  You're going to be great.",michael,14
30181,"Oh, Michael, thank you.  Thank you.",pam,7
30182,"[laughing] Oh, oh!",michael,3
30183,Thank you.  You will not be sorry.,pam,8
30184,"You should have seen your face.  Oh man! Oh, that was classic.",michael,13
30185,Oh. [laughing] I really thought I didn't get it.,pam,9
30186,"Oh, really?",michael,2
30187,Yeah.  'Cause you said I didn't,pam,7
30188,"Oh, man.  That was really good.  That was really good.",michael,12
30189,What about Ryan?,pam,3
30190,"I don't know, I offered him his temp job back.  We'll see.  He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so--",michael,37
30191,Yeah.  Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore.,pam,9
30192,"I don't appreciate you telling me what to do.  So clean out your desk, you are through here.",michael,19
30193,"Thanks, Michael.",pam,2
30194,Oh! What's our receptionists name?,michael,5
30195,Erin.,pam,1
30196,Could you send her in?,michael,5
30197,[opens door] Erin.  Michael wants to see you.,pam,9

30218,Not cool. [Dwight still laughing],jim,5
30220,"Guys, I'm scared. I'm really scared. I think I'm growing into a giant. Because look at this normal sized coffee cup. Looks so tiny in my giant hand now. Anybody want to go to lunch with me later on?",michael,39
30221,I do.,dwight,2
30222,Okay. How about a woman? Pam?,michael,6
30223,"Oh, I can't do lunch. I was just sending you an email. Jim and I need to leave early today to meet with our contractor.",pam,25

30227,"At Dunder-Mifflin there is a very strict no lunch with the boss policy and I don't know who instituted it. I think it started right after my predecessor stepped down, but at the Michael Scott Paper Company I really enjoyed having lunch with Pam and Ryan everyday. So, rules be damned, I wanna have lunch with these people.",michael,58
30228,Who else? Who else? Ryan?,michael,5
30231,Ok. Anyone? Anyone? At all? Accounting? I am accounting on you to go to lunch with me.,michael,17

30241,"Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.",dwight,29
30243,"[sighs] Now, how can I help you?",dwight,7
30245,"Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court -",dwight,31
30246,So someone is going to a court. Big deal.,pam,9
30247,"It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.",dwight,58
30249,There are other reasons to go to Ohio.,jim,8

30253,"Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.",jim,14
30254,And very expensive.,pam,3

30291,Funk is the problem and the solution.,michael,7
30292,That makes sense.,jim,3

30921,"Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quizno's on the turnpike.",michael,17
30923,Uh huh. [gestures to Kevin to keep it quiet] Alright?,michael,10
30926,Yeah.,michael,1
30928,Anorexia. She's an anorexatic.,michael,4
30930,"Nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best I guess.",michael,17
30931,"[to Kelly] I'm worried about Erin, because she's not a very good worker. I don't know how long she's gonna last here.",michael,22
30933,Yeah. So... and Andy is gay.,michael,6
30935,Mm hmm.,michael,2
30936,[whispering to Meredith] Did you hear Pam is pregnant?,michael,9
30938,Yeah!,michael,1
30940,[making a cup of tea in kitchen area],andy,8
30942,What?,andy,1
30944,So?,andy,1
30946,[laughing] I like tea!,andy,4
30948,Hahaha! I like it a lot! I love tea!,andy,9
30950,WHAT??,andy,1
30952,[serious] Who told you that? Was it Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school?,andy,23
30953,"This is not the first time rumors about me being gay have come up. Twice before, actually. Just a weird coincidence... a little too weird. [chuckles nervously] Almost makes you wonder if it's not a coincidence at all. Whoa! Which it is, of course. [long pause] But it makes you wonder.",andy,51
30954,[to Oscar in break room] Did you hear the rumor about me? That I'm gay?,andy,15
30956,And?,andy,1
30958,Do you think it's true? Do you think that I'm... gay?,andy,11
30960,"[scoffs and chuckles] No! But, let me kick you a scenario. I'm at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches. He tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first. But if he was persistent, [long pause] I think I might give in a little bit, just to see what it... felt like.",andy,58
30962,"Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if he's like really aggressive?",andy,14
30964,"It's not real Brad Pitt, this is like, this is my fantasy. Or it's like, not a fantasy, it's just... it's just a scenario.",andy,24
30969,"[whispering] Guys, guys... you can't believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It's just... there's no stalking it. It's a weird day for false facts. Let it go.",michael,33
30970,"[with everyone assembled in conference room] Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors.",michael,28
30971,"[giving envelopes to interns] Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I've attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night.",dwight,28
30973,"[grabs card from Eric, crumples it, throws it to the ground] Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved.",dwight,21
30974,[to Eric] You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.,jim,16
30978,"[to Jim] Tuna, how come you never try to set me up?",andy,12
30979,"Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.",jim,13
30980,Women friends?,andy,2
30981,Yep.,jim,1
30982,Not guy friends?,andy,3
30983,Are you... interested in her guy friends?,jim,7
30984,"No. I mean, for the record, I prefer women.",andy,9
30985,Okay.,jim,1
30986,"But off the record, I'm kinda confused.",andy,7
30987,Really.,jim,1
30988,"Yeah, the evidence is sort of stacked against me, I feel like...",andy,12
30989,Well you gotta figure this out.,jim,6
30990,"Yeah, right?",andy,2
30991,Yeah!,jim,1
30992,How?,andy,1
30993,You gotta have sex with a woman.,jim,7
30994,Right-o.,andy,1
30995,And a man.,jim,3
30996,Ohh...,andy,1
30997,And then compare.,jim,3
30998,Alright. [looks around uneasily] Well hey...,andy,6
30999,Yep.,jim,1
31000,Congratulations to you.,andy,3
31001,On what?,jim,2
31002,[chuckles] Come on... little baby Tuna. Little junior toro.,andy,9
31003,[looks around room nervously],jim,4
31005,What?,pam,1
31007,Why did that come into your brain?,pam,7
31008,[grabs Pam by the arm] Can I talk to you for a second?,jim,13
31009,"[whispering to Pam in corner of room] So, they know.",jim,10
31010,Who did you tell?,pam,4
31011,I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?,jim,8
31012,Nobody!,pam,1
31017,"Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?",jim,10
31019,"[entering conference room] Yeah, yeah... you know what? Let's discredit these rumors.",michael,12
31020,"Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff?",jim,9
31021,"That's not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn't listen to any of that crap.",michael,15
31022,"Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Let's pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning.",pam,21
31025,I heard it from Erin.,andy,5
31027,[quietly leaves room],michael,3
31028,[approaching Michael at elevators] Michael? [to others] He's over here!,pam,10
31029,[to Michael] Where are you going?,pam,6
31030,Nowhere.,michael,1
31031,"Michael... [leads Michael to corner of vestibule, then whispers] You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm? [Michael looks nervously to camera as elevator doors open]",dwight,36
31032,Don't get on it. [Michael inches toward elevator],pam,8
31033,"Michael, don't.",jim,2
31034,Don't... get... on. Do not.,pam,5
31035,Michael...,jim,1
31037,Step away.,pam,2
31039,[reluctantly exits elevator],michael,3
31040,"[to everyone, in conference room] Okay, I made it all up.",michael,11
31042,Even the fact that I'm gay?,andy,6
31043,Yes.,michael,1
31044,[relieved] Yes!,andy,2
31045,"But guys, I'm a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I'm a J. Crew model.",michael,19
31047,"Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself.",michael,21
31049,"Because a lot of people think that models, even though they're very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It's set our industry back quite a bit.",michael,24
31052,"Okay, okay... here's the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn't want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.",michael,35
31055,Michael... am I gay?,andy,4
31056,"[sighs] The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person's life, is that...",michael,16
31057,[interrupting] That Pam's pregnant.,jim,4
31060,Okay. Thank you.,jim,3
31064,Who's the father?,dwight,3
31065,Jim.,pam,1
31067,Four months.,jim,2
31069,Stop. Don't. Just...,pam,3
31070,"Alright, alright... you know, this is not the truth, and you can't fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair.",michael,28
31071,Nope.,jim,1
31072,Yes. Jim...,michael,2
31073,"[arm around Pam] Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.",jim,20
31074,Yes.,pam,1
31075,If everyone would like to see proof.,jim,7
31076,Okay. [leaves room],pam,3
31080,Look at that! [grabs sonogram from Pam] That is the inside of your vagina! [Jim takes sonogram from Michael],michael,19
31081,"[talking head with Jim] It's clear why we were trying not to tell people. That's clear now. [Jim nods, looking at floor]",pam,22
31082,[to Jim and Pam] How long have you known about the pregnancy?,michael,12
31084,A week? A month? A year?,michael,6
31085,"Michael, we only told our parents last week.",jim,8
31086,Did you pee on a stick?,michael,6
31087,I did. It was inconclusive.,jim,5
31088,You should've told me.,michael,4
31089,[exchanges looks with Jim] You're right. We should've realized that you are an equal part of this.,pam,17
31090,"[phone rings, hits speaker button]",michael,5
31092,[gasps],michael,1
31093,[in disbelief] You called Stanley's wife?,pam,6
31094,"Oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh... oh God.",michael,19
31095,Don't take it.,jim,3
31096,"No, I have to take it, or it'll seem suspicious.",michael,10
31097,"If you talk to her, you're gonna tell her about Stanley, and that's gonna seem more suspicious.",pam,17
31098,"No, no, I can do this.",michael,6
31099,You can't do this.,jim,4
31100,"Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won't talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over.",michael,47
31101,That sounds terrible.,jim,3
31102,"Michael, please don't.",pam,3
31103,"[picking up phone] Hey, what up, Cynthia? [lowers phone, looking terrified]",michael,11
31104,"[gets up to leave room, Michael gestures for him to stay]",jim,11
31105,"Hold on a second, Cynthia.",michael,5
31106,"[hangs up Michael's phone, leaves room]",jim,6
31116,[knock at Michael's Office door] Yeah?,michael,6
31118,"Yes, Oscar come on in.  Close the door if you would.  Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me.",michael,22
31120,I'm going in for a procedure today.,michael,7
31122,"Yeah, it's routine.  I'm just a little bit scared.",michael,10
31124,It is a colonoscopy.,michael,4
31126,"In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions? [Oscar looks irritated and frustrated] Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?",michael,36
31128,"My main concern, should I have a safe word?",michael,9
31131,"Abso... you know what? I'll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night.",michael,12
31133,"Ho, Hol, hold on big guy, I'm gonna put it in the mail Sunday night and you'll get it Weds.",michael,20
31135,Sure.,jim,1
31136,"Hey, Good luck.",pam,3
31137,"Oh right, this thing. I remember now.  [whispers to Jim]  What's this about?",michael,15
31138,"Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay.",jim,10
31139,It's okay with me but he's gonna want me in there.,michael,11
31141,Really?,michael,1
31143,"Alright, do you mind if it sit this out?  I have so much work to do, I feel like I'm gonna blow my brains out.",michael,26
31145,"Am I worried that Jim and David are having a meeting without me?  No, because we are the Three Amigos.  And once in awhile one of the Amigos will go off... to the bathroom... while the other two have a secret meeting.  [shrugs]",michael,46
31146,Hey let me escort you to your desk.,michael,8
31147,"Okay, it's just three or four steps but thank you, thank you.",pam,12
31148,"You and Jim are close, huh?",michael,6
31149,"Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together.",pam,9
31150,"Hey, what do you think he and David are talking about? What do you...",michael,14
31151,"Ummm, I don't know.",pam,4
31152,"Well, you said good luck to Jim as he walked in.",michael,11
31153,"Did I?  Doesn't sound like me, not very superstitious.",pam,10
31154,"If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar.  That's how it works.  They inherit things through the breast milk.",michael,30
31155,Please don't talk about my breast milk.,pam,7
31156,I just don't want you to lie to me.  I don't want you to ever lie to me.  Have I ever lied to you?,michael,26
31157,Yeah.,pam,1
31158,I just don't want you to.,michael,6
31162,"Hmmm, interesting.  How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?",dwight,19
31164,"Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country.  I didn't know we were in communist Sweden.",dwight,20
31166,"Nnnnn, that's not... okay.",dwight,4
31168,I'm talking about... hmmm.,dwight,4
31171,"So long Darryl, feel better... [to Toby] He's lying.",dwight,9
31173,"Oh? From who, Dr. J?  Look, you really need to investigate this.  People don't just fall off of ladders.",dwight,21
31175,Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake?  [imitating Darryl]  Y'all having birthday cake?,dwight,28
31177,Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?,dwight,11
31179,It just doesn't add up.,dwight,5
31181,"[walks into conference room on his cell phone, interrupting David and Jim] Uh huh, well if he doesn't like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired.  Sorry, I'm going into a meeting right now.  I will... I love you too.  Bye.",michael,47
31182,Who was that?,jim,3
31183,Sorry about that.  What'd I miss?,michael,7
31185,"Do not mind!  Yes, I do!  No, I don't.  Yes, I do!  No, I don't mind.  Catch you guys on the flippity flop.  Oh this... call waiting.  [answers his phone] Yeah, uh huh,  well you tell the Mayor he just lost six votes.",michael,51
31187,Yeah.,michael,1
31189,Nope.,michael,1
31191,"No, I think they're talking about me.",michael,7
31194,Hey Kelly.,pam,2
31196,"Thank you.  Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine.",pam,25
31198,"I don't know, he hasn't RSVP'd yet.",pam,7
31201,What can I do for ya Hoss?,andy,7
31202,[staring into the conference room] How are your sales doin'?,michael,10
31203,"How are my sales doin'?  Busted.  My numbers are down a little bit and it's 'cause of the economy.  You're not buying it, you're good.  Okay the truth is, I have been having trouble focusing lately.  I'm in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and it's a total mind effer.",andy,59
31205,"Oh, I'm sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay.   'Hey Andy let's go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha.'",andy,24
31206,"Shhh, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on in that room, okay?",michael,14
31207,Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that I'm completely overwhelmed.,michael,15
31208,"You know when they say it's so crazy it just might work?  Well, I don't believe that.  I say go for the air-tight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart.  It is just elegant.",michael,50
31209,[in the cheese cart] Be my eyes.,michael,7
31210,You got it.,andy,3
31212,"Oh, just backing up and turning around.",andy,7
31214,"Dit, dit, dit, dit, it's not for you. [enters the conference room]  Pardon moi, Messieurs.  I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room.",andy,41
31218,"No, I won't.   Alright, thanks for giving me your time,  I appreciate it.",jim,16
31222,"[crawls out of the cheese cart unseen] Hey, hey, you must have walked right past me.  How you doin'?",michael,20
31224,"Yes, definitely.",michael,2
31226,"Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched.",dwight,10
31228,I have been my whole life.,dwight,6
31230,I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.,dwight,13
31232,Yeah.,dwight,1
31234,"Yeah, it's just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime.",dwight,13
31236,"Wa... wa... wait , someone's coming.",dwight,6
31238,"Here, get down! He's not using crutches!  Get the camera!",dwight,11
31240,"Oh, worker's comp, my ass!",dwight,5
31242,Toby...,dwight,1
31244,Ooohhh... [crashes car into garbage cans]  Oh man!  You okay?,dwight,12
31246,Hey Ryan.,pam,2
31248,"So, I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to my wedding.",pam,13
31250,It costs about $75 per person.,pam,6
31252,Can you just tell me now if you're coming or not?,pam,11
31254,"Okay, Ryan Howard, yes.",pam,4
31256,"Kelly Kapoor, yes.",pam,3
31258,Look who you're talking to.,michael,5
31260,"Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever.",michael,23
31262,[looks at Jim]   Permission to speak on the record?,michael,11
31266,"Very much, Jim is my best friend. But it's his performance report... right here.  Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable.",michael,28
31268,"It's not very well written, but you get the gist.",michael,10
31270,I can just continue to run it myself.,michael,8
31272,This was Jim's idea?,michael,4
31274,"Wow.  Ummm, well I'd have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block.",michael,19
31276,"I didn't tell Michael because I thought he'd try to help.  Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.",jim,26
31278,Sure.,jim,1
31279,"[after talking to David, Jim looks dejected] I can't help but feel partially responsible.",michael,14
31280,[shakes jelly beans] Little pick me up?  [Jim accepts] Oh those are the best.  Little sugar rush.,michael,19
31281,"When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?",jim,16
31282,Well we did talk about how handsome you are.,michael,9
31283,Why don't we head in your office to talk?,jim,9
31284,"Oh what a week, God.  We said... I know there were certain things we said...",michael,16
31285,"Michael, look I'll just be honest with you.  Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion.  I actually think that talk went really well.  And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.",jim,44
31286,"Hmmm, that's weird, that's weird... it's kinda weirding me out.  Did you know that Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy.",michael,20
31287,"Michael, did you say anything?",jim,5
31288,"Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion.",michael,27
31289,Really?,jim,1
31290,Yes!,michael,1
31291,You will?  Wanna do it right now?,jim,8
31292,Yes.,michael,1
31293,I tried to keep Michael in the dark.  I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.,jim,24
31294,I need to see your pupils.   I need to see if they're dilated.,dwight,15
31299,We thought that she was you.,dwight,6
31301,Are you... are you serious?  Be... cause you look exactly alike.  Am I the only one?  Are you getting this?,dwight,23
31304,"Aww, Darryl.",dwight,2
31308,"Hey David, this is Michael Scott.  [Jim pushes speaker phone button]  Michael Scott here.",michael,16
31310,Just wanted to talk to you about  Jim Halpert.  I understand that he did not receive the promotion.  And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.,michael,37
31312,"Absolutely, [turns speakerphone off] not. [turns speakerphone back on]  Like I said before, Jim is fantastic and he deserves this job.",michael,22
31314,"Wha... here's the thing, Jim is the best man for this job, I think you should give it to him.",michael,20
31316,"Well, nnnn, that... that was an anomaly.  That file had been falsified.  Toby Flenderson is doing drugs.",michael,19
31320,Wait!  They're using the lift as their own personal elevator.,dwight,11
31322,"He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed.",dwight,23
31324,Really?  Then why is there new wood only on one railing?  Hmmm?   We should check the security tapes Toby.,dwight,23
31327,Yes!,dwight,1
31329,"Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form.",dwight,18
31331,Phhhht.  No judge is gonna believe that...,dwight,8
31334,"Hey, hey Jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face.  Alright,  Just do it.",michael,27
31335,How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.,jim,16
31336,"I never recommended you because I didn't want to lose you and I didn't want to lose Pam, [starts to choke up] and now I don't wanna lose the baby.",michael,30
31337,"So instead, you screwed me?",jim,5
31338,That's what she...,michael,3
31339,No.,jim,1
31341,Kind of in the middle of something here.,michael,8
31343,"I, yeah... no, I'll tell him myself.  Let's both.",michael,10
31344,[on phone] Hello.,michael,3
31346,"No, it's just us.",michael,4
31348,"Oh, oh, well here he is right now.  [Michael knocks on desk]  Come in.  [Makes sound effects for door opening and footsteps and points to Jim to answer]",michael,31
31349,Hi David.,jim,2
31351,Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager.,michael,11
31353,"Wow, that sounds pretty cool.",jim,5
31354,"I like that, so manager and co-manager.",michael,7
31356,Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.,michael,15
31358,"Okay people,  listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed...",dwight,14
31359,"Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make... whoa do you have an announcement?",michael,14
31360,I'm... I was making it.,dwight,5
31361,"Everybody, David Wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager.",michael,19
31363,"Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts.",michael,15
31365,"What's happening to me?  I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together.  Jim Halpert, welcome.",michael,21
31366,[shakes Michael's hand] Thank you. [Dwight looks disappointed and angry behind them],jim,12
31367,AHHHHHHHHHHHH!,dwight,1
31369,Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?,pam,11
31371,"Well, you have to choose a food option and there's information in there about directions and lodging...",pam,17
31373,"You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding.",pam,11
31375,To ask for directions..,pam,4
31377,And you will eat whatever is fanciest?,pam,7
31380,"So rude, right?",pam,3
31382,"[sits down] Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day.  It's incredible.",pam,16
31384,[in Michael's office] Could you please sign my expense report?,dwight,10
31385,"No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic.",michael,20
31386,[in Jim's office]  Sign this.,dwight,6
31387,"Ah, ah, ah. Where's the 'please'? We're not animals.",jim,9
31388,Sign it.,dwight,2
31389,"No, not without a 'please.'",jim,5
31390,Idiot.,dwight,1
31391,[in Michael's office] I have a complaint about Jim.,dwight,9
31392,That is not big picture.,michael,5
31393,"I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.",dwight,17
31394,... Okay.,michael,2
31395,Jim won't sign my expense report.,dwight,6
31396,That is not-- okay-- that is day-to-day.,michael,7
31397,"No, that is huge.",dwight,4
31398,You're trying to trick me.,michael,5
31399,This has to do--,dwight,4
31400,"Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.",michael,10
31401,[in Jim's office] I'd like to lodge a complaint.,dwight,9
31402,I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?,jim,10
31403,You!,dwight,1
31404,Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?,jim,17
31405,One minute ago.,dwight,3
31406,Okay. And how do you feel?,jim,6
31407,Angry.,dwight,1
31408,All right. Did he hit you?,jim,6
31409,No.,dwight,1
31410,Did you cry?,jim,3
31411,No.,dwight,1
31412,Did you feel like crying?,jim,5
31413,No.,dwight,1
31414,I'm just gonna write 'held back tears.',jim,7
31415,"Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.",dwight,8
31416,"If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it.",jim,8
31417,I'm not cr-- uhh!,dwight,4
31420,"Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I'd like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while.",michael,40
31421,Michael...,jim,1
31422,Yes?,michael,1
31423,Can I talk to you in my office for a second?,jim,11
31424,"Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?",michael,12
31427,I have noticed that we--,jim,5
31428,Welcome.,michael,1
31429,Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings.,jim,13
31430,Mm-hmm.,michael,1
31431,"And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--",jim,10
31432,Disruptive.,michael,1
31433,Yes.,jim,1
31434,"No, I don't think they are. I think the meetings are very important.",michael,13
31435,"Okay, maybe we should talk specifics.",jim,6
31436,Let's do.,michael,2
31437,"Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.",jim,8
31438,"N-- well, to be fair, Jim... James... Jimothy... To be fair, Jimothy, the-- ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim?",michael,24
31439,I am.,jim,2
31440,"Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn't about planets...",michael,10
31441,Right.,jim,1
31442,"At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.",michael,53
31443,"Yes, I agree.",jim,3
31444,"Because it's a big universe, and we're all just little, tiny specks of dust.",michael,14
31445,I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day.,jim,12
31446,"You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea.",michael,37
31447,You mean on a weekend?,jim,5
31448,Yes.,michael,1
31449,How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential.,jim,17
31450,Alright. No more meetings this week.,michael,6
31451,Really? You just agreed to that?,jim,6
31452,I can be very suprising.,michael,5
31454,"I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant.",pam,12
31457,"We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We're also accepting other gifts not on the registry... However much.",pam,20
31458,"It's awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn't Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash?",pam,26
31460,"Oh, good.",pam,2
31462,"No, we're not.",pam,3
31464,Mm-hmm?,michael,1
31465,"[walks in, see's Oscar, Stanley, Creed and Kelly sitting in Michaels office] Okay, I thought I saw people missing.",jim,19
31466,"Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each.",michael,14
31467,"Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?",jim,16
31468,"Stanley, you don't need to answer that.",michael,7
31469,Stanley?,jim,1
31471,"Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these.",jim,16
31472,What do you mean by 'these people'?,michael,7
31473,"Michael, this is a conference room meeting.",jim,7
31474,"Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.",michael,20
31475,That's not what I meant.,jim,5
31476,"Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want.",michael,20
31477,I disagree.,jim,2
31478,What do you guys think? [all start talking at the same time],michael,12
31479,"Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?",jim,11
31480,"No, no, no, you don't need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people.",michael,27
31481,"That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.",jim,24
31482,That is not what Wallace told us.,michael,7
31483,That's exactly what Wallace told us.,jim,6
31484,That is not the way I heard it.,michael,8
31486,"It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around.",michael,18
31487,"I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.",jim,24
31488,"No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace. [Michael pulls out his cell phone] I will call David Wallace.",michael,21
31490,Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why don't we just--,michael,13
31491,"Hey, David. You got Jim here.",jim,6
31492,"Hey David, this is Michael, senior co-manager.",michael,7
31494,"Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision.",michael,9
31495,Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.,jim,10
31497,Which is it more of?,michael,5
31499,"David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.",jim,20
31501,I thought maybe we could talk after this is over.,michael,10
31503,"Nope, not at all.",jim,4
31504,"No, it will not be. I am on top of it.",michael,11
31506,"Alright, thanks alot, David.",jim,4
31507,"Talk to you later-- [Jim hangs up] Okay, you didn't let me say good-bye. [sighs, and claps hands once] Alright, I am looking forward to this.",michael,26
31508,You don't have to lie.,jim,5
31509,"I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don't see you anymore.",michael,31
31510,Right.,jim,1
31511,All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.,michael,15
31512,Alright. Let's get started.,jim,4
31515,"You know, there's no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it.",michael,23
31516,"Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?",jim,17
31517,"No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, Jim.",michael,16
31518,Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.,jim,15
31519,"Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?",michael,15
31520,It's hard to tell so far.,jim,6
31521,You use your brain too much.,michael,6
31522,"I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?",jim,10
31523,Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all.,michael,8
31524,You just came up with that.,jim,6
31525,As I was saying it.,michael,5
31526,"Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit.",jim,13
31527,[in nerdy voice] Con-- you look like a nerd.,michael,9
31528,Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.,jim,11
31529,Pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.,michael,14
31530,Pro-- no favoritism.,jim,3
31531,"Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there.",michael,14
31532,"I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart-- [pulls out a pie chart] How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.",jim,53
31534,I don't think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.,pam,10
31536,Mm-hmm.,pam,1
31538,Yeah.,pam,1
31540,Okay.,pam,1
31542,Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. [looks down at the check] oh look! 'Mrs. Pam Halpert!' That's the first time I've seen it in writing!,pam,29
31543,"You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.",jim,19
31544,That will not go over well.,michael,6
31545,"I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us...",jim,31
31546,"Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna kill myself.",michael,16
31547,I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking.,jim,9
31549,Michael.,jim,1
31550,And then another--,michael,3
31551,"Look, you have a lot of strengths.",jim,7
31552,"Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are.",michael,8
31553,I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.,jim,12
31554,Ha! That-- I am not known for that!,michael,8
31555,But there is a reason why I'm here!,jim,8
31556,Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!,michael,8
31557,"No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!",jim,11
31558,"Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don't you enliven me?",michael,16
31559,I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!,jim,9
31560,Ah.,michael,1
31561,"At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision.",jim,18
31562,"Okay, here's a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?!",michael,17
31563,"But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.",jim,37
31564,"Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don't you run yourself out there and tell them? [laughs] You call it.",michael,19
31565,[leave the conference room to address everyone],jim,7
31566,[to the camera] This had better be terrible.,michael,8
31569,"Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults.",jim,19
31573,"Ooh, easy. That's not it at all.",jim,7
31575,"Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.",jim,15
31581,This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!,dwight,10
31582,"Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--",jim,11
31583,"What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!",dwight,12
31591,"Her kid needs shoes, Jim!",dwight,5
31593,"Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so... [imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles, Michael comes over by Jim laughing]",jim,23
31597,My plan-- a man-- panama.,michael,5
31598,That's not how that goes.,andy,5
31600,"Thank you, Meredith.",jim,3
31603,"Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise? [all say yes] Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we're going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do.",michael,38
31606,What about a raise based on merit?,michael,7
31607,Rank each person individually?,jim,4
31608,"Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best.",michael,8
31609,"[sarcastically] Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started. [starts to write on a piece of paper]",jim,23
31610,Are you making a--,michael,4
31611,Nope. I'm numbering the paper.,jim,5
31616,[out the side of his mouth] And Jim!,dwight,8
31618,I think it was Creed.,dwight,5
31620,"[to camera] It's going really well, actually.",jim,7
31621,"[to camera, holds up a bean] Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture [walking around the table] of who you think deserv-- who's that? [picture that Michael drew of toby, looks like a monster]",jim,52
31622,Toby.,michael,1
31623,He's not a part of this. You know that.,jim,9
31624,Just wanted to draw a picture of him.,michael,8
31625,"Okay, your move.",jim,3
31626,Alright! Who to pick? [walking around the table] Who to pick?,michael,11
31627,Here we go.,jim,3
31628,I... will skip a turn.,michael,5
31629,"Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.",jim,12
31630,I need more time.,michael,4
31633,"Come on in. [everyone looking around at all the pictures and beans on the table]   That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.",dwight,34
31635,Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager.,dwight,10
31636,"Hey, what are you guys doing in here?",michael,8
31638,"Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?",pam,13
31640,Jim?,pam,1
31641,I was just trying to be unbiased.,jim,7
31647,"There's no way that Stanley gets more beans than me. [starts to take Stanley's beans, Stanley swats Andy's hand with his crossword puzzle] That is ridiculous. This is how it works. [everyone continues to argue]",andy,35
31649,"Thank you! That is exactly-- by the way, I would also like a raise.",andy,14
31653,"No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? [all groan] Okay.",dwight,13
31654,"[leaving his office, hurrying to Jim's office]",michael,7
31656,[in Jim's office] How you doing?,michael,6
31657,"Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four.",jim,14
31658,"Oh, what are you usually?",michael,5
31659,Six. You?,jim,2
31660,"Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero.",michael,9
31661,"I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?",jim,11
31662,"I know, I know.",michael,4
31663,We tried to find the fairest way to do it.,jim,10
31664,"Yes, we did.",michael,3
31665,I just-- what?,jim,3
31666,"Um, nothing. I just... I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you. [leaves office]",michael,29
31670,[to camera] Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?,jim,18
31672,[Michael give Jim a 'World's Best Boss' mug] Thank you.,jim,10
31673,You're welcome.,michael,2
31674,What's in here?,jim,3
31675,"Gin. [toast, sip]",michael,3
31676,Ooh!,jim,1
31677,[someone knocks] Just pretend we're not here.,michael,7
31679,"Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you.",pam,10
31681,$100 now for sure.,pam,4
31683,"Yeah. No, no, I'll um-- the hundred. I'll just take the hundred.",pam,12
31685,How sure is this?,pam,4
31686,The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.,pam,15
31687,"I'm sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomach's a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less perfume... and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room?",pam,38
31688,We would really appreciate it.,jim,5
31689,Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed. It's amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It's so bad ass.,dwight,34
31690,"Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy.",pam,20
31692,"Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.",dwight,33
31694,I don't think I'm asking for too much. I guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace.,pam,19
31696,[standing next to a car decorated for leaving a wedding] What do you think? I spent all morning on it.,michael,20
31697,It is really special.,jim,4
31698,"Yeah, but aren't you supposed to do that to our... no. It's great.",pam,13
31699,It's just a really important day for me.,michael,8
31700,"Well, congrats.",jim,2
31701,Thanks.,michael,1
31703,"Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don't column.",jim,12
31705,No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.,jim,8
31707,Come on. You've got to be kidding me.,dwight,8
31708,Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.,pam,25
31709,Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.,jim,11
31711,"Well, we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned.",pam,14
31713,That's nice.,jim,2
31714,"You know, Angela, you don't have to come to the wedding.",pam,11
31716,Yes she does. Yes she does. We're all gonna go and we're gonna have a good time. [hugs Angela],michael,19
31718,No.,michael,1
31719,Next time we're all in this room Jim and I will be married.,pam,13
31720,We'll see.,dwight,2
31721,"Thank you, Dwight.",pam,3
31722,Good-bye.,jim,1
31723,See you later. [others say good-bye],pam,6
31724,"And, hey, don't embarrass me when we go to Niagara.",michael,10
31725,"What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara. [laughter]",andy,8
31726,Don't. Don't. Don't. You stole my joke. Don't steal my joke.,michael,11
31727,No... I didn't steal your joke.,andy,6
31728,Yes. I said that yesterday.,michael,5
31729,But you can say that about anything.,dwight,7
31730,Dwight...,michael,1
31731,"What happens in accounting, stays in accounting.",dwight,7
31733,"No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that's my joke.",michael,9
31734,It's easy. That's what I'm saying.,dwight,6
31736,Pam and Jim's wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe.,michael,18
31737,I stole the guest list from Jim's desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.,dwight,20
31738,Get out of here.,michael,4
31739,Yes.,dwight,1
31740,"Oh, my God, Dwight.",michael,4
31741,"For instance, Pam's cousin, Jocelyn Webster.",dwight,6
31742,There's... a name.,michael,3
31743,Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.,dwight,9
31744,"Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn.",michael,6
31745,Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.,dwight,12
31746,Ok.,michael,1
31747,"She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.",dwight,18
31748,Is that all you have on her?,michael,7
31749,"Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.",dwight,14
31750,You're an idiot.,michael,3
31752,"[in Andy's car, Andy driving] Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to?  It's like a five hour drive-ish, you know.",andy,34
31754,Mmm-hmm. Erin?,andy,2
31756,Not only is Erin really sweet and cute... she smell's like my mom.,andy,13
31757,"[in car] Hey, my aunt told me something neat.",pam,9
31758,Yeah?,jim,1
31759,She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.,pam,21
31760,"Oh, wow. That's cool.",jim,4
31761,Yeah.,pam,1
31762,"[aims imaginary camera at Pam] Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever.",jim,17
31763,Oh.,pam,1
31764,Lousy Picture.,jim,2
31765,We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.,pam,11
31766,"[in car, Michael driving] Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep.",michael,11
31767,What? No way!,dwight,3
31768,Those glasses are super dark.,michael,5
31769,Oh. God.,dwight,2
31770,"Alright. We need some tunes, I think.",michael,7
31771,You know what? I made you a cd...,dwight,8
31772,You did?,michael,2
31773,Mmm-hmm.,dwight,1
31774,That was nice of you.,michael,5
31775,This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.,dwight,14
31776,"Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in.",michael,14
31777,"You're gonna like this. [Dwight's voice on the cd] 'Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. 'What's next?', you're probably wondering. Don't be scared of you're night in heaven--' [Michael turns off cd]",dwight,51
31778,Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?,michael,16
31779,Yeah. It's practical.,dwight,3
31780,No. No. That's not how it works.,michael,7
31781,"Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It's really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.",jim,30
31783,And Beesly. Tonight we're in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.,jim,15
31785,"I know. We're pretty excited, too.",jim,6
31786,Can we take a look at the suite now?,pam,9
31788,Oh... is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend?,pam,10
31790,Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. I'll break in the bed. [laughs],andy,16
31791,I don't like that.,jim,4

32118,She's-- okay.  Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist?  You have to take x-rays.  You have to scrape the plaque off of people's teeth.  You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they're not scared when the dentist comes in.  It-- it--,michael,54
32119,You should ask her out.,dwight,5
32120,[stands up and walks away]  I already have my European girlfriend.,michael,12
32127,Oh cause of last night?  No way.  Reports have been exaggerated.  Weddings make me very emotional.  I um--I just have that side to me.,andy,28

32175,"There.  Now we're even.  [Pam laughs and mimes taking a picture, they kiss]",jim,15
32176,[sighs] Everyone's driving me crazy.  I know way too much about Andy's scrotum.  [Jim chuckles] And my mom won't stop freaking out about my dad's new girlfriend.  [sighs] This is supposed to be our wedding day.  Why did we invite all these people?,pam,47

32257,"Okay, okay. God. What you people don't know about business, I could fill a book with.",michael,16
32259,What?,michael,1
32261,"[into mini recorder] The fundamentals of business by Michael Scott. Over one billion sold. More than the Bible, I'm not surprised. Chapter one. The businessman...",michael,25
32263,"Oh hi. I'm sorry, just a sec. [whispers] Erin, you're supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?",michael,25
32265,Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon.,michael,13
32267,Push free play til tomorrow morning. [to Grotti] Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. You're seeing how the sausage gets made.,michael,19
32269,Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage.,michael,13
32271,Mmhm.,michael,1
32273,Yep.,michael,1
32275,Okay.,michael,1
32276,"There is nothing more insulting to a great salesman, than having to listen to a bad salesman. It's like a great basketball player having to listen to a bad basketball player.",michael,31
32278,What do you think?,andy,4
32279,I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.,dwight,16
32281,"Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up.",michael,9
32283,"Mmhm, I hear you. The truck.",michael,6
32285,"Okay, well.",michael,2
32287,Do your worst. [they shake hands],michael,6
32288,"[Grotti knocks over coat stand grabbing his overcoat] Oh, great.",michael,10
32290,Mmhm.,michael,1
32291,What happened in there?,andy,4
32292,"Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.",michael,15
32293,Did he threaten you?,dwight,4
32294,"No Dwight, not everything is a threat.",michael,7
32295,Mobsters are!,andy,2
32296,There is no such things as monsters.,michael,7
32297,He drives an SUV!,andy,4
32298,"I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space.",dwight,12
32300,"No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.",dwight,16
32301,"Wait, when did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance.",michael,17
32302,"All mobsters have a front, sometimes it's selling insurance, sometimes it's waste management or sanitation.",andy,15
32304,"I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance.",michael,14
32305,"Yeah, buy my insurance or I'll burn your warehouse down!",andy,10
32306,Exactly.,dwight,1
32307,He did talk about a fire in the warehouse...  and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer.,michael,19
32311,"[over chatter] Hey, hey hey, calm down. Calm down. Calm down.  Ryan, you lived in New York, what do you think?",michael,22
32313,Okay.,michael,1
32315,"Um it is, Grotti.",michael,4
32318,"It's John Gotti, you idiot!",andy,5
32321,Yeah. It's pretty close.,andy,4
32323,No I disagree. 'R' is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it 'murder.' And not 'muck-duck.',dwight,20
32324,Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.,michael,13
32325,Lock your door!,dwight,3
32326,I'm not gonna lock my door.  [door closes. Then clicks locked],michael,12
32327,Hello?,jim,1
32329,"Oscar! Uh, what is going on?",jim,6
32331,"Look, We're in Puerto Rico, so-",jim,6
32332,Hey Oscar.  It's Pam. Hey. We're on our honeymoon.,pam,10
32334,"Unless someone very close to us is in immediate physical danger, you should not be calling us.",pam,17
32336,It's Grotti. He's following up.,michael,5
32337,"Already? This, this guy is persistent!",andy,6
32338,[reads email] 'I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business.',michael,16
32339,That's bad.,dwight,2
32340,Yeah.,michael,1
32341,That's bad.,dwight,2
32342,"Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or?",michael,12
32343,Yeah right! You heard him! He's gonna burn down the warehouse or run one of our trucks off the road.,andy,20
32344,"Okay, I'm calling the police.",michael,5
32345,"[hangs up, rips cord from phone] That is the stupidest thing you could do right now!",andy,16
32346,He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported.,dwight,12
32347,All right.,michael,2
32348,"Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed!",andy,21
32349,Shh!,michael,1
32350,You know what?,dwight,3
32351,That's not gonna happen.,michael,4
32352,That's an exaggeration.,dwight,3
32353,That's how it works!,andy,4
32354,What am I supposed to do here?,michael,7
32355,"When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back",andy,24
32356,I was thinking exactly the same thing.,michael,7
32357,"No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat.",dwight,23
32358,Dwight...,andy,1
32359,"The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.",dwight,22
32360,"I don't know, I don't know about that.",michael,8
32361,"Wait let's hear him out, this is interesting.",andy,8
32362,"Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent.",dwight,26
32363,Okay.,andy,1
32364,Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.,dwight,27
32365,[snaps fingers] I like this plan. I'd like to officially withdraw my plan.,andy,13
32366,"Hold on, hold on! Just-",michael,5
32367,"No, no, no. My plan is out! We do this the hard way.",andy,13
32368,"All right. I will meet with him, but I'm not going alone.",michael,12
32369,Well you're gonna have to. [overlaps] Dwight: We'll be right beside you.,andy,12
32370,What?,andy,1
32371,"[Andy dressed as a mechanic, Cornell hat on] What are you wearing? Who's Pat?",michael,14
32372,"Well if I'm gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I'm a mechanic with a tire thing.",andy,29
32373,Do you know how to use it?,dwight,7
32374,"To change tires, no. But it's metal, I can hit somebody with it.",andy,13
32375,"Let's go, come on. [whispers] God!",michael,6
32376,Should I change?,andy,3
32377,You're wearing loafers!,dwight,3
32378,Forget it! Forget it!,michael,4
32379,[Andy is playing with the tire iron] Take that thing off the table! Please!,michael,14
32380,Well then I can't use it. I'm just gonna hide it.,andy,11
32381,Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.,dwight,14
32382,Oh! God! [smacks roaches],andy,4
32383,Oh my God!,michael,3
32384,You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-,dwight,15
32385,"Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is.",michael,10
32386,Hello.,michael,1
32388,Mr. Grotti we meet again. These are my associates.,michael,9
32390,Hi.,andy,1
32391,Hello.,dwight,1
32393,Yes.,michael,1
32395,Well.,michael,1
32398,Okay.,michael,1
32415,Oh he's not that nice.,dwight,5
32416,That's not true.,michael,3
32417,Hmm. Very true.,andy,3
32418,Okay shut up.,michael,3
32422,I will have the gabba-gool.,michael,5
32424,The gabba-gool.,michael,2
32426,"[with Soprano's inflection] You know, gabba-gool.",andy,6
32427,"I don't, I don't have to have that.",michael,8
32428,"What he's trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.",dwight,8
32429,"Guys, guys-",michael,2
32431,That's okay.,michael,2
32432,Bring him the gabba-gool!,dwight,4
32433,"Shh. I will have the spaghetti, with a side salad.",michael,10
32435,"If the salad is on top, I send it back.",michael,10
32444,I don't think our company actually needs any more insurance. So I am out.,michael,14
32446,Maybe we have a plan for you?,andy,7
32449,Yeeeeah.,andy,1
32451,Yes I can.,andy,3
32452,"No, no no, no. Come on. I'm sorry, we're having our salad.",michael,12
32454,Okay!,andy,1
32456,"Hey, do you need any help?",michael,6
32458,He's a good mechanic.,michael,4
32460,I don't...,michael,2
32461,He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.,dwight,11
32462,"Okay, okay okay.",michael,3
32463,So we're choosing...,dwight,3
32464,"Yep, all right.",michael,3
32465,Check out Dental?,dwight,3
32466,Put it down.,michael,3
32467,"Black goes on the red. With the... If we... Positive... Mo- it being a motor drive, it's probably down.",andy,19
32469,"You want to do this junior? I didn't think so. Sorry. It's kind of a long day at the... mechanic store. [Andy places connections wrong, smoke and explosion set off] Aaaah!  You got a leaky spark tube.",andy,38
32471,"So your car's totaled. Uh, you're just gonna want to get a refund on that. Or my guy could do it. He's great. But uh, I can't do that for you. I work exclusively on motorcycles. [Andy walks away, woman is exasperated]",andy,42
32473,"Yeah. Just thinking about how, uh, I had this car, this Italian car, and I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil, but I wouldn't give it any oil. And then, one day it exploded and it killed everyone and that's what I'm afraid of.",andy,51
32475,"It was before, my tech- my technical training.",andy,8
32476,Don't do it!,dwight,3
32477,Do it.,andy,2
32478,Don't.,dwight,1
32479,Just do it.,andy,3
32480,Okay.,michael,1
32482,Yes.,dwight,1
32483,Okay.,michael,1
32484,"I don't understand, why would you buy a policy?",dwight,9
32485,It's just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.,michael,11
32486,"You were man enough to back down Michael, I'm proud of you.",andy,12
32487,I had to make a snap decision Dwight.,michael,8
32488,"It wasn't a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.",dwight,12
32489,It was a lot of snap decisions.,michael,7
32490,Do you know what 'snap decision' means?,dwight,7
32491,Yes!,michael,1
32492,It means like this. [snaps fingers],dwight,6
32493,Just get in the car.,michael,5
32494,Hello?,jim,1
32495,Jim?,michael,1
32496,Michael?,jim,1
32497,Oh thank God.,michael,3
32498,"How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran.",jim,11
32499,"It wasn't easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I'm in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier.",michael,49
32500,That sounds bad.,jim,3
32501,"Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I'm turning to you my friend.",michael,20
32502,I'm gonna help you through it all right?,jim,8
32503,Okay!,michael,1
32504,All you're gonna need to [faking a bad connection] and-  it- and then go to--,jim,16
32505,Jim? Are you?,michael,3
32506,And then you'll be saved.,jim,5
32507,"What? Wait, I didn't hear a thing you just said.",michael,10
32508,Just [drops] and then you'll be saved.,jim,7
32509,"No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again!",michael,10
32510,A- ah--,jim,2
32511,No!  Oh my God!,michael,5
32512,And you'll be saved.,jim,4
32513,"No, Jim please, repeat what you're saying! I can't understand you!",michael,11
32514,I [drops out] at the Bermuda Triangle. An-  M-  please don't call again.,jim,15
32515,Jim?!? [dial tone] Oh my God.,michael,6
32516,"Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can't afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away?",michael,33
32518,Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing?,michael,10
32520,"All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks.",michael,8
32521,"We have let Michael down, and it's 85 percent your fault.",dwight,11
32522,He's alive.  So you're welcome.,andy,6
32523,"Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.",dwight,19
32524,"Yeah, some of that existed before.",andy,6
32525,"Not the living in fear, that's new.",dwight,7
32526,"You're right, that is new.",andy,5
32527,Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy.,dwight,10
32528,Well I don't see that happening.,andy,6
32529,Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?,dwight,19
32530,Are you saying-,andy,3
32531,Yeah...,dwight,1
32532,That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain?,andy,10
32533,What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia!,dwight,16
32534,That seems a little far-fetched.,andy,5
32535,Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown?  And that happened.,dwight,19
32536,Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean.,dwight,6
32537,No. He's not. He's just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still don't understand how this works.,michael,17
32538,"No, Michael. What we're trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who's a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy.  His background is perfectly clean.",andy,38
32539,"It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.",dwight,45
32540,Class act. Boy scout.,andy,4
32541,But Grotti acts like he's mafia though.,michael,7
32542,He's trying to intimidate you to close sales. He's just a pushy salesman.,andy,13
32543,And he made us all look like chumps!,dwight,8
32544,[grunts],michael,1
32545,"If there is one thing I hate more than the mafia it is a liar. I wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars. Bury them in my yard. And I wouldn't tell the cops a thing. Not that I would be lying per se. But I would just get really quiet, all of a sudden.",michael,59
32547,This is Scott.,michael,3
32549,Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me?,michael,8
32551,Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I'm actually kind of PO'd.,michael,14
32553,"I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance.",michael,16
32555,I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk.,michael,21
32556,Whoa. Okay.,andy,2
32557,You suck!,michael,2
32558,Okay that's-,dwight,2
32559,And I'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance.,michael,8
32560,"That's good, let's wrap it up.",dwight,6
32561,"How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it?",michael,22
32563,Doubt it. [disconnects call],michael,4
32565,What a tool. [Dwight and Andy exchange looks] What?,michael,9
32566,"Next time you look in the mirror, you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia!",andy,19
32567,No. What do you mean?,michael,5
32568,"We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared.",dwight,12
32569,What?,michael,1
32570,You successfully backed down the mob!,dwight,6
32571,You made the mafia apologize to you! You made the mafia be polite!,andy,13
32572,Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But I'm not.,michael,12
32573,"So I looked him in the eye and I said, 'Not today Grotti, Not today. And not tomorrow, and not the next day. Or the day after that. And you can tell all your friends that if I see them, then they're already dead.' I said something like that.",michael,49
32574,Very close.,dwight,2
32576,Erin?,michael,1
32578,Coffee?,michael,1
32580,"Not from the kitchen. Stop and Shop. If it's not Stop and Shop, I send it back.",michael,17
32582,Large. If it's a medium I send it back. If it's an extra large I send it back.,michael,18
32584,Go.  Any questions?,michael,4
32585,[on phone] Are you kidding me?,pam,6
32587,"Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really can't handle the fact that you're calling us here!",pam,26
32589,Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.,pam,13
32595,It was.,jim,2
32596,It really was.,pam,3
32597,Really was.,jim,2
32599,Puerto Rico was awesome.,jim,4
32600,"Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot.",pam,25
32601,[goofy voice] Frank and Beans. [laughs] Always makes her laugh.,jim,10
32602,[goofy voice] Frank and beans!,pam,5
32603,"Is there someone there? Who is there? I hear voices, is somebody there?",michael,13
32604,Yeah!,dwight,1
32605,Is someone there? I can't see you because I'm blind.,michael,10
32606,"Its Jim and Pam, Michael.",dwight,5
32607,[gasps] It is?,michael,3
32608,Yeah...,dwight,1
32609,"They're back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam! [reaching out with hands at chest level]",michael,13
32610,Nope.,jim,1
32611,"And oh, Jim...",michael,3
32612,"Hi, Michael.",pam,2
32613,"Oh, I haven't see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy.",michael,25
32614,Blind-guy McSqueezy. How do I describe it? It is a character I've been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improve class absolutely hate him. [groans],michael,35
32616,Some candy.,pam,2
32618,That's it.,pam,2
32620,"[behind Pam, acting out blind-guy, groaning]",michael,6
32621,It's good to be home.,pam,5
32622,This conversation has two items on the agenda.,dwight,8
32623,Do we have a conversation scheduled?,jim,6
32624,"Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say... [high voice, holding up wooden mallard] con-quack-ulations!",dwight,56
32625,"Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.",jim,9
32626,"[duck voice] You're welcome! [quacks, laughs]",dwight,6
32627,"I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing.",dwight,53
32628,I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years.,dwight,10
32629,It's a real handsome duck.,jim,5
32630,"Mallard. Okay, I'll get out of your hair.",dwight,8
32631,Hey!,pam,1
32633,"Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy.",pam,8
32635,Awesome! I'll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it.,pam,11
32637,[laughs] I think it'll be okay.,pam,6
32639,Great.,pam,1
32641,I have recently taken a lover.,michael,6
32642,"Well, that's great. Congratulations. Who's the lucky lady?",jim,8
32643,Pam's mom.,michael,2
32644,What?,jim,1
32645,"Pam's mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding?",michael,7
32646,You're messing with me.,jim,4
32647,About what?,michael,2
32648,You did not have sex with Pam's mom.,jim,8
32649,"Oh, big time.",michael,3
32650,What kind of car does she drive?,jim,7
32651,She drives a green camry.,michael,5
32652,[expletive],jim,1
32653,And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.,michael,12
32654,Oh my God. [Michael bangs the table] Oh my God.,jim,10
32655,[laughs] What?,michael,2
32656,"Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-",jim,6
32657,"Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright?",michael,24
32658,Oh my God.,jim,3
32660,"Not now, Toby, my God!",jim,5
32662,"Get the hell out of here, idiot.",michael,7
32664,"Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.",jim,20
32665,"I think you're underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.",michael,16
32666,"No, not more than anything.",jim,5
32667,"Okay, I have a good thing with the mom-",michael,9
32668,Don't call her 'the mom.',jim,5
32669,She's right on my way home from work.,michael,8
32670,"Then take a different way home, man!",jim,7
32671,"I di- alright, I'll take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam.",michael,22
32672,"Okay, so we're good.",jim,4
32673,Yeah.,michael,1
32674,Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two?,michael,11
32676,Sure. Thanks for asking.,michael,4
32678,Frank and beans!,jim,3
32679,"Frank and beans! [both laugh] So what'd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?",pam,20
32680,You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?,jim,10
32681,"Bottle of rum it is. [takes package out of bag] Alright, shall we?",pam,13

33093,And I'll just watch him.,pam,5
33095,Yes.,pam,1
33096,Yeah. We are thrilled.,andy,4
33097,Mmm-hmm.,pam,1
33098,"In fact, we spent the whole weekend researching various birthing coaches. Wasn't that fun, honey?",andy,15
33099,"It was, sweetie.",pam,3
33101,Yeah. On Clearview Avenue.,andy,4
33103,Yeah.,andy,1
33107,It's a fish.,michael,3
33109,It could've died of natural causes. So...,michael,7
33112,"Do not mock, Oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want?",michael,12
33114,What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm.,michael,12
33116,"Ok. Great meeting, everybody. That's it.",jim,6
33117,"No, no.",michael,2
33118,Thank you. [everyone begins to leave],dwight,6
33119,No. We are not done here. This-,michael,7
33120,"One of the baby books suggets the best birthing posture is on all fours, like an animal. I just wish I had a special telephone so I could find out exactly wht the little soy bean wants. Right? Hey, little soy bean. What do you want? Right. How do- It- I felt it kick!",andy,54
33122,"Oh, my gosh. Like a little magical foot just high-fived me.",andy,11
33123,"Yeah, well, that'll happen.",pam,4
33124,"Oh, my gosh. It's like he's trying to say, 'I love you, too, Daddy'. I love you, too. [leans over and kisses Pam's belly]",andy,24
33125,Sometimes we're so excited we forget where we are. Like at a business meeting.,pam,14
33126,"Message received, little soy bean.",andy,5
33127,"I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.",jim,10
33128,"No, Jim. You don't understand. Things like this don't just die. Kids in high school still call me 'Ponytail'.",michael,19
33129,"No, they don't.",jim,3
33130,"Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail.",michael,17
33131,Maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away.,jim,11
33132,I want to make fun of you right now.,michael,9
33133,"Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.",jim,9
33134,No. Don't do that. You're not. You're not stupid.,michael,9
33135,See?,jim,1
33136,"Oh, my God.",michael,3
33137,"Hey. I- I just wanna say that I cannot believe that I walked into a Koi pond. I mean, seriously. Walk much? [everyone starts laughing] Oh. I should wear a snorkel to the next business meeting that I go to.",michael,40
33139,"Well, you know what? You're right, Phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That's the problem.",michael,29
33140,"Michael, please. Stop it now. You're embarrassing yourself.",dwight,8
33147,Hey. Who wants to watch Michael's pond dive? My roommate's friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he's bringing it over.,michael,29
33148,"Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so...",jim,30
33150,"Well, that went pretty well.",andy,5
33151,"Yeah, I guess.",pam,3
33152,"We got a maybe. It was our first maybe. Going by the Nard Dog curve, I'd say we nailed it.",andy,20
33153,"If I'm being completely honest, I could've done without the belly kiss.",pam,12
33154,You know what? I'm sorry. 'Cause in that moment I knew I was kissing your belly too much.,andy,18
33155,Yeah. Way too much.,pam,4
33156,Yeah.,andy,1
33157,"I mean, what the hell was that?",pam,7
33158,What the heck was that?,andy,5
33159,When you cried?,pam,3
33160,"Agh- try almost cried, ok? I just got caught up in the fantasy.",andy,13
33161,You're fantsy involves comparison shopping birthing classes?,pam,7
33162,"No. I know I'm gonna go with Miss Janet. I just- I don't know. It was fun to role play, right?",andy,21
33163,Hmm.,pam,1
33164,"I mean, it was fun for me. Having a wife and a little baby. Agh, I'm so sick of being single.",andy,21
33165,"Well, are you dating anyone?",pam,5
33166,What do you think of Erin? I mean- she's- I- She's kinda cool.,andy,13
33167,Ah.,pam,1
33168,You think I can do better?,andy,6
33169,Ah.,pam,1
33170,Gotta get my goin' out on.,andy,6
33172,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this.",jim,9
33174,What happened to 'Do Not Mock'?,jim,6
33176,That will inevitably lead to mocking. So...,jim,7
33178,Is this the tape of me falling?,michael,7
33183,Guys. Michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it.,jim,15

33185,What are you doing?,jim,4
33186,It's alright. I can handle it.,michael,6
33187,No.,jim,1
33188,"I am a grown-up, Jim.",michael,5
33192,See what?,jim,2
33194,"Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.",jim,11
33196,Play it again. [everyone has the same reaction as before] He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.,dwight,19
33197,Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.,jim,17
33198,I don't think you froze.,michael,5
33199,It's a killer new dance move. [re-enacts leaning back] Do you wanna talk in your office?,jim,16
33201,I didn't ask you. [back to Michael] Would you like to talk? [walks away],jim,14
33202,Judas.,dwight,1
33203,"Jim is my enemy. But it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So, Jim is actually my friend. But... because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy. So, actually Jim is my enemy. But-",dwight,54
33204,"I should've grabbed you. I'm sorry. Look, I thought I could've done today's sales call alone. I mean, I may never be as good a salesman as you are, but I at least need the chance to do the job.",jim,40
33205,Jim is jealous of me? Jim is jealous of me.,michael,10
33208,Oscar's a douche.,michael,3
33209,[laughing] He's alright.,jim,3
33210,"No. He's a- yeah, he's alright. Ok. [holds door open as they exit]",michael,13
33211,Thanks Michael.,jim,2
33212,You're welcome. Whoa! [leans back] Almost fell. [they both laugh],michael,10
33213,"Hey, Erin. Do you mind faxing this for me?",pam,9
33215,Ok.,pam,1
33217,Mmm-hmm.,pam,1
33219,"No. It was a total waste of time. Um... it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. He's really cool.",pam,26
33221,"Yeah, he is.",pam,3
33223,That's... right. He's like Marlon Brando.,pam,6
33225,I actually do mean Marlon Wayan. Yeah.,pam,7
33226,Good morning everybody.  Who would like an authentic New York bagel?  Hmmm?  Stanley?,dwight,16
33228,"No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you.",dwight,11
33229,Wow. H & H.  You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels?,andy,18
33230,"Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?",dwight,10
33232,Thanks.,andy,1
33233,"Oh, don't mention it.  You owe me one.  You all owe me one.",dwight,15
33234,Good morning Michael.,dwight,3
33235,Morning Dwight.,michael,2
33236,Hungry?,dwight,1
33237,No.  I had a fish stick sandwich.  Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches.  My girlfriend didn't want hers.  Because I guess I'm the only aphrodisiac she needs.,michael,32
33238,Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.,dwight,6
33239,"Well, yeah...",michael,2
33240,You're thinking of deer penis.,dwight,5
33241,It worked.,michael,2
33242,Regardless.  That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry.  [holds up tray] Bagel?,dwight,24
33243,I don't mind if I do.,michael,6
33244,K. I brought cheese too.,dwight,5
33245,I'm taking one for my lady friend.,michael,7
33246,Excellent.,dwight,1
33247,Brain food. Thank you very much.,michael,6
33248,Okay. [walks out of Michael's office] You owe me.,dwight,9
33249,Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore?  Geez.  When did everyone get so cynical?,dwight,41
33250,"Pam, would you care for a bagel?",dwight,7
33251,"Oh, no thank you.",pam,4
33252,"That's right.  You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time.  I'll try again.  Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.",dwight,27
33253,I have an early lunch.,pam,5
33254,"Michael's been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom.  I don't know.  I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he's planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go.  No way out.  No way out.",pam,55
33260,Hey!  [gets up to greet Helene] Hey. Happy birthday.,pam,10

33266,Yeah--,michael,1
33268,I think everyone has meet Helene.  Shall we?,michael,9
33272,"No, that wouldn't be--",michael,4
33274,Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to-- inappropriosity.,michael,12
33276,Hey--,michael,1
33277,Kevin!,pam,1
33278,"Please, Kevin.  You're fired.  [Kevin looks at Jim; Jim shakes his head]  Sorry, sorry.  Work with a bunch of idiots.  Shall we go?",michael,28
33279,"Yes, let's go. [looks at Erin and nods]",pam,8
33281,"Oh, you guys.  Just one second.  [picks up phone] Oh my gosh!  Are you serious?  Shipping emergency.  I don't think I can go to lunch.",pam,30
33282,"Oh man, that's crazy.  Right as we were on our way out too.",jim,14
33283,I know.  Isn't that always how it goes?,pam,9
33284,Rarely.  If ever.  Let me give it a whirl.  I'll talk to them.,jim,16
33285,I want to handle it.,pam,5
33286,That's okay.,jim,2
33287,I feel like its--,pam,4
33288,It's my pleasure. [takes phone from Pam] Hello?  Well that's great. [hangs up phone]  Turns out the paper was there all along.,jim,24
33292,Yeah-- it's exciting.,pam,3
33294,Pam's sales are fine actually.,jim,5
33295,"Just want you to succeed Pammy.  You know what, we shouldn't even be talking about business today.",michael,18
33296,Thank you.,pam,2
33297,Today is about family.,michael,4
33298,Why did I get in the car?  I could of struggled.  I have a whistle in my purse I didn't even blow it.,pam,25
33299,"Oh, Dwight.  I have a little surprise for you.",andy,10
33300,Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.,dwight,13
33301,"Yes! [they laugh] And I wanted to return the favor.  I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and she's polished right up, back up to her former glory.",andy,51
33302,Wow--,dwight,1
33303,Feel it against your cheek.,andy,5
33304,I will.  [Andy rubs the briefcase against Dwight's face],dwight,10
33305,You give me a gift-- Bam!  Thank you note.  You invite me somewhere-- Pow! RSVP.  You do me a favor-- Wham!  Favor returned.  Do not test my politeness.,andy,33
33306,Let me get that door for you--  [runs to open door],dwight,12
33307,Whoa--,andy,1
33308,There you go!,dwight,3
33309,Thank you very much.  Now I've got it for you. [holds open door],andy,14
33310,"Oh... goodness... thanks.  You know, here's a healthy fitness tip.  If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.",dwight,29
33311,Is that right?,andy,3
33312,Observe. [walks towards desk],dwight,4
33313,Huh. [laughs; follows Dwight],andy,4
33314,Right?,dwight,1
33315,That really works.,andy,3
33316,"Yeah, feel free to use that.  Anytime.  Okay.",dwight,10
33317,"Hey-- oh, hold on a second.  Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus.",andy,15
33318,[straightens Andy's tie]  And that needs to be straight as an arrow.,dwight,13
33319,Whoa--  thank you very much.  [takes off Dwight's glasses and blows on them]  Oh boy.,andy,18
33320,Thank you very much for that.,dwight,6
33321,[puts Dwight's glasses back on Dwight's face]  You are very welcome.,andy,12
33322,[pulls out Andy's chair] Have a seat.  Allow me.,dwight,10
33323,[pulls out Dwight's chair] Have a seat yourself.,andy,8
33324,You know what?  I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse.,dwight,16
33325,Not necessary.,andy,2
33326,"No, no, no! [takes mouse and runs away]",dwight,8
33327,You didn't have to do that.,andy,6
33328,Andy is complicating things.  But I'm not worried.  This will only up my game.,dwight,16
33329,Hello.  Scott.  Table for four.,michael,7
33331,"I use to love coming here.  The chicken parm is good.  Big part of my childhood.  Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too.",pam,27
33332,What table should we take?  So many to choose from.,michael,11
33333,Wow.,jim,1
33335,"What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations.  Oh, wait a second!  You mean this one?  Wow!",michael,24
33336,"Michael, you did all this?",pam,5
33337,Not about taking credit.  Let's just say we all did it.,michael,12
33339,"Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place.  Really makes me want to go to Italy some day.",michael,23
33341,Oh. Thank you.  Thanks for lending me the books.,michael,10
33342,"So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year?",pam,9
33344,49 again? That's nine years in a row.  This is now our longest family tradition.,pam,16
33345,That's funny.,michael,2
33347,"Oh, burn.  Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too. [they laugh]",jim,15
33348,You're 54 years old.,michael,4
33350,You're 58 years old?,michael,4
33352,Congratulations.,michael,1
33353,The only time you should care about a woman's age is if she is too young for you and I am not robbing the cradle.  If anything I am robbing the grave.,michael,33
33354,"Mom, have you decided what you want to be called?",pam,10
33356,Please be Grandma.,pam,3
33357,Definitely Grandma.,jim,2
33358,I want you to be Grandma.,pam,6
33360,[nods uncomfortably] That--,michael,3
33361,"Yay, Grandma!",pam,2
33362,"Hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think?",michael,11
33363,Maybe.,pam,1
33364,Helene?,michael,1
33366,"I am.  I'm definitely going to do it.  I've already got the run and the bike thing down.  Just need to learn how to swim.  Come on, you in?",michael,33
33368,"So it's a matter of interest.  Good, okay.  It's not anything you would have ever done.",michael,18
33370,Well there's no jumping in a triathlon.,michael,7
33372,You're thinking of the broad jump.  Would you try-- bungee jumping?,michael,12
33374,Snowboarding?,michael,1
33376,I might.,michael,2
33378,[sighs] Nothing.  Just life-- and doing things-- before you die. I don't know.,michael,14
33379,Do I really want to go snowboarding?  No.  But I would like to if I wanted to.,michael,19
33380,[singing fanfare] Aye-yi-yi! [lifts covers off trays of food],andy,9
33381,What's going on in here?,dwight,5
33383,Oh... no... really?,dwight,3
33384,"Yep, yep.  Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness.",andy,15
33385,There is no book.  There's only a survival guide.,dwight,10
33386,"You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone.",andy,11
33387,"Okay, well, allow me.  You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make.  I will make everyone's tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!",dwight,23
33388,So we should get the check?,michael,6
33389,What about your gift Michael?,pam,5
33390,"Oh, no, no, no. No.  It's stupid.  You'd hate it.  I hate it.",michael,16
33392,Yes you will.,michael,3
33393,He locked himself in his office all morning working on it.,pam,11
33395,Aww--,pam,1
33396,I literally-- I put no thought into the wrapping at all.  Might as well of been toilet paper.,michael,19
33398,That's just an arbitrary title.,michael,5
33400,Penny for your thoughts.,jim,4
33402,Wow.,jim,1
33403,That's amazing.,pam,2
33404,"It's not amazing... at all.  It's sort of weird that I went and did that.  And now your wish won't come true, so that blows.",michael,27
33406,Oh that I plagiarized I think.,michael,6
33408,[whispers to Pam] Shel Silverstein.,jim,5
33409,Yeah.,pam,1
33411,That's really nice Michael.,pam,4
33412,I think it sucks.,michael,4
33414,"Well, that's because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things.  It's a generational-- sort of gap between us.",michael,24
33416,Home run Michael.,pam,3
33417,You set the bar so high.,jim,6
33418,That was a bunt.,michael,4
33419,"Whoa, whoa Dwight.  I'm going to do this.",andy,9
33420,"Hey, hey, hey--  relax I got it covered.",dwight,9
33421,"No, I insist.",andy,3
33422,"No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist.   [pushes Andy out of the room and locks the door]",dwight,20
33423,"Ok, Dwight this is ridiculous.",andy,5
33424,Don't worry about it.  You can just owe me.,dwight,10
33425,Hey. Where'd you go?,pam,4
33426,"Oh, just went to the bathroom.",michael,6
33427,And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?,pam,11
33428,I got thirsty.,michael,3
33429,"Okay, weirdo.  Come on.  It's time for cake.",pam,10
33430,"Honestly, for a long time I thought I was going to grow old with Holly.  And then I met Helene.  And she is great and she already knows and has done everything  that I have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it.  But, I think I want to do those things myself.",michael,59
33431,Cakes really good.,pam,3
33433,"Finish your cake, Helene.",michael,4
33435,"I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible  I need to tell you.  I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing.",michael,34
33436,"Helene I think you're a wonderful person and I-- God-- I've enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much.  But I have to consider Pam's feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her.",michael,53
33437,"Michael.  Michael ,it's okay.",pam,5
33438,No it's not.,michael,3
33439,"I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy.  And that makes me happy.",pam,36
33440,Wow.  That just-- you've really grown.,michael,7
33441,Well--,pam,1
33443,"Okay, so--",jim,2
33444,"And I want kids.  And you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.",michael,18
33445,Michael.,pam,1
33446,It's not my decision.  It's mother nature.  And mother has very strict rules about fer--  [waitress comes over to pour water; long pause] -- tility.,michael,28
33449,"Well, hobbies--",michael,2
33450,Stop.,jim,1
33451,[reaching for something on the top shelf]  Ahh.,andy,9
33452,What's going on?,dwight,3
33453,Stupid things wedged up there.  No one in this office will help me.,andy,14
33454,"Alright, move it.",dwight,3
33455,What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something?  That is a recipe for a ghost.,andy,18
33456,"Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time.",dwight,9
33457,It's like a little envelope-- there you go.,andy,8
33458,Got it. [looks at envelope] To Dwight. Wha--  [opens envelope] Starbucks gift card.,dwight,14
33459,Surprise! [laughs]  It's from everybody.  $15 value.,andy,9
33460,Dammit.  I am no closer to taking Jim down.  What a waste of a day.  I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now. [bends over and hold hand about 1/2 an inch from the floor]  They're mushrooms.  They don't get that high.,dwight,53
33461,Pamela Beesly Halpert--,michael,3
33462,What?,pam,1
33463,May I have a word with you in my office please?,michael,11
33464,I am working.,pam,3
33465,"Well, this is a work related matter.",michael,7
33466,Really?,pam,1
33467,Yes.,michael,1
33468,Really?,pam,1
33469,"Yes.  Join me please, won't you? [Pam gets up and follows Michael into his office]  I am going to give you a raise.",michael,25
33470,Why?,pam,1
33471,Because of all the good work you've done.,michael,8
33472,I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.,pam,9
33473,"That's-- no, no-- it's not about numbers, Pam.  It's about attitude.",michael,12
33474,I have the worst attitude of any person here.,pam,9
33475,Do you want the raise or what?,michael,7
33476,"Yeah, I'll take it. [turns to leave]",pam,7
33477,"Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached.  [Pam sighs]  And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.",michael,26
33478,You're bribing me?,pam,3
33480,I want to hit you.,pam,5
33481,What?,michael,1
33482,I want to hit you.  I'll do that.,pam,9
33483,"[nervous laughter] Oh-- okay , what? I don't-- Are you kidding?",michael,11
33484,No.  Are you kidding?,pam,5
33485,Ye-- No.  Alright.  I'll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just--,michael,18
33486,No.  I don't think I can hit you in the office.,pam,12
33487,Okay.,michael,1
33488,"So, um... we'll do it after work.  In the parking lot.  In front of everyone.  I'm going to hit you as hard as I can.",pam,28
33489,Okay.,michael,1
33490,Okay.,pam,1
33491,Okay.,michael,1
33492,See you then.,pam,3
33493,See you.,michael,2
33495,Hey.,michael,1
33499,Never.  About what?  A little-- what are you talking--,michael,11
33501,What punch?,michael,2
33503,I'm pretty sure we said slap.,michael,6
33506,I-- mmm-- I'm good.,michael,4
33508,Hey.,michael,1
33509,Hey.,jim,1
33510,Do you and Pam ever get frisky?,michael,7
33511,Inappropriate.,jim,1
33512,I mean-- do you ever wrestle with each other?,michael,9
33513,All the time.,jim,3
33514,Really?,michael,1
33515,Yeah.,jim,1
33516,She strong?,michael,2
33517,She wants it bad Michael.,jim,5
33518,Can you stop this?,michael,4
33519,I can.,jim,2
33520,Okay.,michael,1
33521,And I don't support her choice to hit you.,jim,9
33522,I don't either.,michael,3
33523,But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.,jim,14
33524,Mmm-hmm.  I know.,michael,4
33525,I just need some time.,jim,5
33526,You gotta do something--,michael,4
33527,I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.,jim,14
33528,How much time do you think you'll need?,michael,8
33529,No more than a week.  Maybe two weeks.,jim,9
33530,"Come on, man!",michael,3
33532,Oh...,pam,1
33534,Right.,pam,1
33536,Okay.,pam,1
33538,[stands up; gets into stance] Okay wait-- it's-- you're saying it comes from the foot.,pam,15
33540,Okay. [punches Toby's hand],pam,4
33542,Wow!,pam,1
33550,Am I scared of getting hit in the face?  No.  Everyday weirdo's pay dominatrix's hundreds of dollars for that very privilege.  I'm scared I'm gonna love it.  [claps hands] Let's do this.,michael,36
33551,It's okay guys... I can handle this.  Everybody can go home.,michael,12
33553,You're just a bunch of voyeurs.  Are you eating popcorn?,michael,11
33555,Are you ready?,pam,3
33556,Yes.,michael,1
33557,"[goes to punch Michael; he flinches] You have to keep your hands down, Michael.",pam,14
33558,I know. [sighs] Okay.  Alright.  [Pam goes to punch him again] Oh-- God!,michael,15
33559,"Michael, you have to put your hands down.",pam,8
33561,"Okay! [braces himself] Pam, Pam-- I'm really sorry.  I'm sorry.",michael,11
33562,What are you sorry for?,pam,5
33563,So many things.  I don't know.  It's hard to choose.,michael,12
33564,How about for dating my mom?,pam,6
33565,Maybe that--,michael,2
33566,And dumping her on her birthday.,pam,6
33567,Yes.,michael,1
33568,Okay-- just-- don't ever date a member of my family again.,pam,11
33569,Okay.  I promise.  [Pam starts to walk away] For the record your mom came on to me. [Pam turns around and slaps him; he gasps],michael,27
33571,Are you okay?,pam,3
33572,No!,michael,1
33573,You're okay.,pam,2
33574,Feel better?,jim,2
33575,No.  You were right.,pam,5
33576,"[walks with Michael back into the office; Michael is clutching is face and limping] Wait, why are you limping?",dwight,19
33577,I don't know.,michael,3
33578,Let's get some raw meat on that face.  I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.,dwight,17
33580,Ahh... [Dwight is holding a frozen chicken to his face],michael,10
33581,"Good, good.  Keep it on there for another five minutes.  Just let the swelling go down.",dwight,18
33582,Oh thank you.  Thanks.  I owe you one Dwight.,michael,11
33583,Fire Jim.,dwight,2
33584,No.,michael,1
33585,I'm cashing in the favor.  Fire him.,dwight,8
33586,What are you talking about--,michael,5
33587,Do it.  Promote me.  Tri-managers.,dwight,7
33588,Forget that.,michael,2
33589,Can I have an office?,dwight,5
33590,No.,michael,1
33591,You know what you can keep your stupid favor.  It's worthless.  And this is my dinner on your face.  I'm keeping it.,dwight,25
33592,[pats face] Oh that feels better.,michael,6
33593,"[screaming, Phyllis and Dwight wrestling]  Got you!  Broken arm!  Boom Boom Boom!  Broken Nose! Boom Boom Boom Boom!  Broken Nose!  Boom!  Ha, gonna flip you!",dwight,32
33594,"Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change.",jim,36
33596,"OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know.",jim,10
33597,"No, there is a defense for that.  Let me demonstrate.  Someone attack me.  Kevin, go!",dwight,18
33599,False.  I did choke you with your shoelace.  Now come at me!,dwight,14
33600,"OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.",jim,18
33601,That is correct.  Unless there happened to be measles present.,dwight,11
33602,"So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?",jim,23
33603,Easy.  Allow me to demonstrate.  I am attacking myself with a throat punch.  Here it comes. [gives himself a fake throat punch]  Block.  Grasp wrist as such. [grasps wrist],dwight,34
33604,"And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.",jim,16
33605,"Good point.  Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. [gives himself another throat punch and proceeds to both attack and defend himself]  Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut.  Uh oh, up to the nose.  No, you're not.  Ow!  Oh!",dwight,46
33606,"Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool.",jim,11
33607,"He really is, but not for long.  [steps on foot]  Ow! Instep, oh, not again.  [more screaming] You let go, you let go.  Oh, you're right, I can't hold on.",dwight,34
33608,You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.,jim,20
33609,The important thing to remember Jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise. [hits himself in the groin and moans],dwight,23
33610,But I would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy.,michael,17
33611,I did stand up comedy once.,andy,6
33612,You did?,michael,2
33613,"Yeah, I killed.",andy,3
33614,That sounds like it was hilarious.,michael,6
33615,It was hilarious.,andy,3
33616,Michael?,dwight,1
33617,Yes?,michael,1
33618,What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?,dwight,10
33619,"You'll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day.",michael,14
33620,"This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin.",dwight,9
33621,"Woo hoo, shout out!",michael,4
33622,Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal.  I just want to stress that it's all conjecture.  If there's any concrete news you will know ASAP.,dwight,33
33623,"Erin, do we have the journal?",michael,6
33625,Did you?,michael,2
33626,"Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online.",pam,8
33627,"Oh, the Wall.",michael,3
33629,It's $1.99 to finish the article.  I wonder what it was going to say? [no one makes a move to pay for the article],michael,25
33630,Are you serious? [starts typing on the computer and Andy begins to lean in toward the computer],jim,17
33631,"I got it, I got it... Oh, Tuna beat me to it.",andy,12
33633,"No, no, that doesn't make any sense.",michael,7
33636,"Oh, that sounds awful.",michael,4
33638,"Oh God.  Well, that's an interesting theory.",michael,8
33639,You know what?  You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows.  It doesn't pay much and you can't unionize.,dwight,24
33641,"Ah, well maybe you should spy on him.  [in Valley Girl voice] Oh my God, wouldn't that be hilarious! [laughs]",michael,21
33643,"OK, OK.  Good.  I'll catch you on the flippity flip.  Bye. [hangs up phone]  He's busy, he'll call me back when he's free.",michael,27
33645,"No, I'm just poopin'.  You know how I be.",michael,10
33647,Crazy world.  Lotta smells.,michael,5
33649,"I like Erin. There, I said it.  I was kinda hoping she would ask me out, but things have not panned out on that front, so... it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws.",andy,41
33650,"[Michael in his office playing music loudly, Jim walks in and turns the volume down, Michael trailing off on singing]  We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen.",jim,38
33651,"OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody.  Anything new on YouTube?  Doesn't even need to be good.  Oh God, I can't think, need more Mullins.",michael,30
33652,"Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine.  So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they'll follow along.",jim,37
33653,"Monkey see, monkey do.",michael,4
33654,That's it.,jim,2
33655,Monkey pee all over you.,michael,5
33656,"That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?",jim,10
33657,We have a monthly staff meeting,michael,6
33658,"Alright, let's conference room it up! [everyone is now in the conference room]  Here's the deal guys.  There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.",jim,35
33659,"Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better.  I only slack off when things are good.",jim,23
33660,"Customers have to use the coupon code from the website.  And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.",jim,36
33661,[Michael leaves] He needs me.  Seat saved infinity. [leaves],dwight,10
33662,"OK, great.",jim,2
33663,"[walks back in, on cell phone] What? Oh my God!  [everyone starts asking questions]  There has been a murder.  There's been a murder in Savannah. [runs back to his office]",michael,33
33664,"Games have the power to distract people from stressful situations.  Battleship got me through my parents' divorce.  Operation got me through my vasectomy, i.e., my operation.  I don't think I would have been able to endure my breakup with Holly had it not been for Toss Across.",michael,50
33666,"It is so much fun.  Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it...",michael,23
33667,"Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.",jim,11
33668,"This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, it's about murder.",michael,11
33669,I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this.,jim,11
33670,"Tube City, you owe me one.",michael,6
33671,"Co-managing is a give and take.  You have to pick your battles.  One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them.  He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one.",jim,55
33674,"There will be food. You leave, you do not get food.",michael,11
33676,Sandwich platters.,michael,2
33678,Baby carrots. [Angela sits back down],michael,6
33681,"OK, use your imaginations.",michael,4
33682,Who'd you get?,andy,3
33684,"Oooooo, saucy.",andy,2
33686,"Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local bartender and Nellie's brother.",andy,8
33688,It's not scary.,michael,3
33690,Who are you?,pam,3
33692,"Well how do you think I feel?  I mean I have to play Caleb Crawdad, handsome playboy.  Every night, a different woman.  Being oogled.  Having to hug and kiss and spoon, I make them feel beautiful.",michael,40
33693,"[looks at Oscar who is using his phone, grabs it] Well, well, well.  What is this contraption, I do declare?",michael,21
33695,"Who's Michael?  I'm Caleb Crawdad, I do declare.",michael,9
33697,That is the way Southern people talk.,michael,7
33698,And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?,jim,9
33699,"Delta Burke, I do declare.  Now, shall we get to the mystery?",michael,13
33700,"I'll go.  [stands up, begins speaking with a southern accent]   My name is Deborah U. Tante.   Deb for short.",pam,24
33701,"That's clever, Debutante.",andy,3
33702,Bill Bourbon was my uncle.  I would have never hurt him any more than I'd hurt a June bug.,pam,20
33704,I do not.,pam,3
33705,"Well, you do actually.  You've got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin' out of your mouth.",andy,37
33707,"Uh, not familiar, what province is he from?",andy,8
33710,"Wait a minute, wait a minute.  I'm the butler.  You were listening in on that?  You rich people.  You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!",dwight,34
33711,"No, no, no. Don't turn this into a political thing.",michael,10
33712,I will poison your food.,dwight,5
33713,"I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if'n she don't mind.",andy,15
33714,"Oooooo, doggie, we got a party now!",michael,7
33715,I do believe that the game is a big hit. People are really diving into their characters.,michael,17
33718,"[accent] Sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect.",michael,12
33720,"Very good, very good.  Now, no one was there in the wine cellar. [Creed gets in his car and drives away]",michael,22
33721,[in character] Hey there young lady.,andy,6
33723,I would be remiss if I did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend.,andy,20
33725,"Alright, a plan it is.",andy,5
33726,"Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts.",dwight,10
33728,I know you did it!,dwight,5
33729,"I know she didn't do it.  It's never the person you most suspect. It's also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most.  Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect.",dwight,51
33735,"I'm a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin.  Which would be a whole lot less appealing, because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone.  And she might be a murderer.",andy,37
33739,"[accent] Whoa. What's this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son?  This here's Savannah.",michael,17
33741,"OK, I'm going back to work.",jim,6
33742,No no no no no no no. [accent] I'm going to skip forward to a relevant clue.  Here we go.,michael,21
33745,"[accent] Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- that's a misdirection.  We still don't know who the murderer is.  [everyone leaves] Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here.  I can't do this myself.  Voodoo Mama Juju... what am I gonna do?",michael,47
33746,"OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.",jim,8
33749,"Alright guys, it's a work day and you guys work here, so let's go do some work.",jim,17
33752,"[Michael walks in] Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets.  Do you want to-",jim,18
33753,"[accent] I do believe you have me mistaken, my name is Caleb Crawdad. Y'all skedaddled way too soon.  We need to reopen this case.",michael,25
33754,"No, you're not reopening the case.  The case is closed.",jim,11
33755,No it ain't.,michael,3
33756,"Frankly, I'm not surprised.  A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns.",dwight,16
33757,"Just thinking about Weekend at Bernie's.  It's funny, the guy's dead the whole time.",andy,15
33759,"Speaking of weekends, you excited about our date this weekend?",andy,10
33761,"Yeah, OK.",andy,2
33763,"[accent] Well, finest steakhouse in all Savannah.",andy,7
33765,Did you mean a real date?,andy,6
33767,Totally... not. [Erin gets up and walks away],andy,8
33769,"You're sure it was water, it couldn't have been acid?",dwight,10
33770,"I already declared you, it was too dark to tell.",michael,10
33771,"Stop playing games with me, Crawdad.",dwight,6
33772,"This is not a game, this is my life.  You are out of order, sir.",michael,16
33773,Answer me.,dwight,2
33774,You are out of order.,michael,5
33775,You are out of order.,dwight,5
33776,You are-,michael,2
33777,I think Michael may have snapped.,pam,6
33778,Or maybe he's just stuck in character.,jim,7
33779,"Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck?",pam,7
33780,Both.  They're both worse.,jim,5
33781,"It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out.  We're not going under.",jim,18
33782,"Jim, what if we both lose our jobs?  I'm trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can't think of one.",pam,28
33783,"[comes into Jim's office using accent] Deb, what in the world - do you have the vapors?",michael,17
33784,"Michael, not now.",jim,3
33785,"Can't wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now.  Come on.  Come on.",michael,19
33786,I should just go.  [accent]  Where to now Caleb?,pam,11
33787,To Mama Juju Boo Boo.,michael,5
33788,"Michael, can I... OK, I'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why.",jim,17
33789,Because this is the recreation of a crime scene.,michael,9
33791,Hey shut up.  You're dead.,dwight,6
33792,"Michael, can I talk to you in your office?",jim,9
33793,"No Michael here, my name is-",michael,6
33794,Caleb!,jim,1
33795,Today of all days...,jim,4
33796,"No, you shut up.  They need this game, Jim.  Let us have this stupid little game, alright? [Jim nods]",michael,21
33797,"[accent] Oh, you startled me.  My stars, my heart nearly leapt out of my chest.  What can I do you for?",michael,23
33799,Detective Wallace?,michael,2
33801,"Aw, shucks, tell him I'm not here.",michael,7
33803,"No, I only answer to Detective Wallace 'cause I got a warm body in the other room.",michael,17
33804,I'll take it.,jim,3
33805,Hey David.,jim,2
33807,"Oh, OK.",jim,2
33809,"Sure.  Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-",jim,32
33811,OK.,jim,1
33813,See ya.,jim,2
33814,[Jim comes out of the office]  What's the news?,pam,10
33815,Nothing yet.,jim,2
33817,Well there is some bad news.  [accent] There has been another murder.,jim,13
33818,"A murder, you say?  I do declare.",michael,8
33819,Conference room everyone.,jim,3
33821,No.,jim,1
33823,"Oh, this could be a juicy one.",dwight,7
33824,Get in there!,michael,3
33826,"There has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue.  My little heart can barely take it no more.  [regular voice] Today is the hardest I have worked in a long, long time.",michael,37
33827,"[Andy, Michael, and Dwight are pointing imaginary guns at each other] I didn't do it!",andy,15
33828,"OK, everybody just calm down.",dwight,5
33829,I am calm.,andy,3
33830,On the count of three we're all going to put down our guns.,michael,13
33831,I have crossbows.,dwight,3
33832,"We'll put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?",michael,12
33833,"OK, I'm ready.",dwight,3
33834,"One, two, three.. [all scream]",michael,5
33835,"Andy revealed himself to be a double agent.  At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent.  And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent.  Oh, and it is 6:00.",jim,44
33836,"[Michael, Dwight, Andy and now Pam are in the circle and training their 'weapons' on each other, Jim walks in]  Really?",jim,22
33837,[accent] It wasn't me.  I'm not goin' down for this!,pam,11
33838,"Yeah, I want to go home.",jim,6
33839,"Get the keys out of my purse, start the car. [Jim and Pam slowly back out of the office, Pam has her weapon trained on everyone and then they run out]",pam,31
33841,Bow down before Recyclops.,dwight,4
33842,"Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.",jim,34
33843,"Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?",dwight,24
33844,The next year he really stepped things up.,jim,8
33845,Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?,dwight,12
33846,A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.,jim,10
33847,Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.,dwight,8
33848,Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember.,jim,18
33849,Recyclops will have his revenge.,dwight,5
33850,I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.,jim,21

33852,Recyclops destroys! [starts tearing through the office],dwight,7
33854,Yes.,dwight,1
33856,Polluticorn wishes. [starts spraying the office with something],dwight,8
33857,That's aerosol spray. It's terrible for the environment.,andy,8
33858,Humans are terrible for the environment.,dwight,6
33859,The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child.,pam,17
33860,Mmm.,jim,1
33861,A world where you truly can be anything you want.,pam,10
33862,"God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart. [Dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses]",jim,20

33864,That's great.,pam,2
33865,"I want it to be better than 'Great', Pam. How 'bout I remain seated... and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing. [demonstrates]",michael,30

33871,Don't do the twirl.,pam,4
33873,The twirl sucks.,dwight,3
33875,[still doing the voice & spinning in his chair] Hate the twirl!,andy,12
33876,Ok. Obviously I'm not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave.,michael,18
33878,"I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? It's not even a twirl, it's a spin. I might do the spin.",michael,22
33880,"Ok, Oscar, I don't need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.",michael,12
33882,"Well, could you condense it please?",michael,6
33885,"It's not a limo. It's a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling.",michael,18
33888,They sent a limo.,michael,4
33889,Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when they're in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration. And in this case I think we are celebrating me.,michael,39
33890,"[everyone is rushing down the stairs to see the limo] Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that.",michael,21
33891,What kind of mileage does this baby get?,dwight,8
33894,Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs.,michael,13
33895,Calves. Calves all the way.,dwight,5
33896,I'm so jealous right now.,andy,5
33897,"Hey, you know who you should be jealous of? Yourself. Because you're invited and you're invited and you're invited and you and you and you and you and you and you-",michael,31
33899,What?,michael,1
33901,The limo seats eight. Ok. Then Jim and Pam and Ryan plus a guest.,michael,14
33904,[others  start raising their hands to be picked] Mmm... whoa.,michael,11
33906,"[in the limo with Dwight, Andy and Oscar] I wish the windows weren't tinted so people could see us in here.",michael,21
33907,"Hey, guys, do you think anyone might have had sex in here?",andy,12
33908,Definitely.,michael,1
33909,Smells like it.,dwight,3
33910,Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. That's bigger than my bed.,michael,11
33911,Word.,dwight,1
33912,Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!,andy,3
33913,[the limo driver raises the divider window] Who's playing with the button?,michael,12
33914,"Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?",jim,12
33916,But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program.,jim,17
33918,Could go either way.,jim,4
33920,Maybe we should just wait and find out.,jim,8
33922,Ok.,jim,1
33924,Nah. Might as well do it now.,jim,7
33925,"Michael, what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting? Are you just gonna wave, or what?",andy,18
33926,I will have to answer.,michael,5
33927,I'll ask you a question.,dwight,5
33928,"Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park.",andy,13
33929,Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?,dwight,16
33930,"No, no. That's too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, 'Well, we're sort of on thin ice.' [they all laugh] I won't say that. I'll something like that.",michael,33
33931,This is your big day. Come on.,andy,7
33932,"Oh, my god. This is it.",michael,6
33934,Yes.,michael,1
33936,"Oh, hi.",michael,2
33938,"Well, thank you and, and please call - continue to call me Mr. Scott.",michael,14
33940,"Well, I guess this is as far as I can take you guys. So -",michael,15
33941,Kay.,andy,1
33942,"Good luck, Michael.",dwight,3
33943,See you later.,michael,3
33944,[walking past bodyguards at the door] Officers. Thank you.,michael,9
33946,Thank you.,michael,2
33948,Hello.,michael,1
33950,Thank you.,michael,2
33952,"Oh. It was awesome. Very, very sublime.",michael,7
33955,"It's nice to meet you, too. It's an honor and a privilege.",michael,12
33957,Ah. [bows] Your eminence.,michael,4
33959,"Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che. [spots microphone and gets in line, sees an empty mic and attempts to get there first] Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. [a line appears from nowhere] Ah. Damn it. [ heads back to the original line which is now even longer] Wha- okay [grunts]",dwight,55
33960,"I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy.",dwight,31
33962,"Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get in line.",andy,9
33964,"Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the - America's biggest financial crisis?",andy,23
33965,How is he gonna have grandkids?,dwight,6
33966,You guys ever protect the president?,michael,6
33968,What about Madonna? Or Obama twins? Anybody famous?,michael,8
33971,Rock and roll. [they walk into convention room and are booed by everyone],michael,13
33973,[to David] This is not as much fun as I thought it would be.,michael,14
33975,"[accidentally into his microphone] We're going bankrupt, you think? [angry jeering from the crowd] They are really angry.",michael,18
33979,No. You will not.,dwight,4
33981,"Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences?",dwight,12
33983,Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.,dwight,15
33985,[loudly applauds] Yes.,dwight,3
33987,"Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?",jim,10
33989,Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me.,jim,19
33991,I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael. [Stanley laughs] What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.,jim,22
33994,"Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?",jim,11
33998,Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael? [everyone raises there hands - including Pam],jim,24
33999,Stuff gets around. I don't participate.,pam,6
34000,Who here heard it from Ryan?,jim,6
34002,Yes.,jim,1
34004,"I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright?  Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael? [Pam, after a moment,  is the only one who raises her hand]",jim,45
34005,I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.,pam,12
34007,You should get up and say something. You've got to be true to what's in there. [points to Oscar's heart] Don't be a wuss.,andy,24
34008,"I've always been the guy who can rally other people to rebel. In high school I organized a walk out over standardized testing. Got over 500 students to just skip the SATs. At the last second I chickened out, took it anyway, got a 1220, always regretted it. I feel lachrymose .",andy,52
34011,"Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. These are not criminals. They are nice. They invited me to come here today. They invited me to their hospitality suite where I  had free food and it was delicious. Get this. Know how nice they are? The sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in Scranton. That's -",michael,59
34013,Yes.,michael,1
34018,I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?,jim,13
34019,Can you actually fire people?,pam,5
34020,"To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.",jim,18
34021,"Well, I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone.",pam,9
34022,"Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.",jim,8
34023,"Oh. Ok. I've heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, 'Hey, look. We parked over here!'.",pam,17
34024,"Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.",jim,29
34025,"Well, you'll figure it out.",pam,5
34028,"[board of directors has started to exit] Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen. We'll be back with some answers. [a few murmurs from the crowd of 'What answers?'] I - ok. I know that you're mad at me and you're mad at all them -",michael,49
34031,"Hey, Ryan. How's it going?",jim,5
34033,Mmm-hmm.,jim,1
34035,"Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it.",jim,13
34037,You know what?,jim,3
34039,I think I know the problem.,jim,6
34041,I think you seem distracted.,jim,5
34043,"But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help.",jim,16
34045,"I am, too. Let me show you.",jim,7
34046,Wow. Things are really picking up.,michael,6
34048,What?,michael,1
34050,I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.,michael,10
34052,"We tell them the plan, right?",michael,6
34054,"Here's what we're gonna do. The 45 day thing that I outlined, we go with that. Day 45, company saved. Day 44, go. What do we got? We have 15 minutes.",michael,31
34056,Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.,michael,8
34058,I am the guy who roused that crowd.,michael,8
34060,Got them on their feet.,michael,5
34062,They were so happy down there.,michael,6
34065,"Ok. Alright. Well, I know a guy. This Mexican guy. He is a math whiz. He knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and I am going to call in a little favor.",michael,35
34067,"Well, I'm texting him, so.",michael,5
34069,"It's done. [Oscar, sitting in the lobby, receives a text]",michael,10
34071,"I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. [addresses the whole office] Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention. [turns back to Ryan] I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.",jim,53
34073,"Let me show you what I mean. [Jim opens the closet door to reveal a work station] Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.",jim,33
34075,Right.,jim,1
34077,[laughs] You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it. [shuts the door and walks to his office],jim,25
34080,Tell them what you told me. This is genius.,michael,9
34082,Tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and - this is all -,michael,17
34084,It's all good. It's all good stuff. Lay it on them.,michael,11
34086,That wasn't what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better.,michael,19
34088,"O-kay. Oh... hey, hey. [follows Oscar into the hall] What are you doing?",michael,13
34090,"Wow, man. That -",michael,4
34092,That was embarrassing.,michael,3
34094,"For me, too. You embarrassed me.",michael,6
34096,"Well, that was a waste of a text. Let's get down to brass tacks. I think that we might be in trouble. We don't seem to have a plan so I'm thinking I go down there. Maybe rattle off a few jokes. Congressman could follow.",michael,45
34098,"Uh, I'm not a moron. Time after time my branch leads in sales. I have personally won over 17 Dundie awards. So, I am not a moron and I am just trying to help, you know? So... you're the moron.",michael,40
34099,[zipping through the hall while texting],michael,6
34102,"[running out of the building with Oscar, Andy, and Dwight] Oscar! Oscar! Come on!  There he is! There he is! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!  Scranton! Scranton! Scranton! Dunder Mifflin!",michael,34
34106,Yeah.,dwight,1
34107,You wanted to see me?,andy,5
34108,"Yeah, Have a seat.",michael,4
34109,Is it serious? [Michael stares]  Wow.  Andy's a wittle scared.,andy,12
34110,"Okay, right there is the problem.  There have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk.",michael,21
34111,Why would people say that?,andy,5
34112,I have it on good authority that you said the following. [hands Andy a notecard]  Can you read that back to me?,michael,23
34113,Andy have a boo-boo tummy.,andy,5
34114,Mmm-hmm.,michael,1
34115,"Would you rather me say 'Hey guys, my irritable bowel syndrome is flaring up?'",andy,14
34116,Okay.,michael,1
34117,Crazy diarrhea happening right now?'  Cause things can get real adult real fast.,andy,14
34118,"You are also on record as saying 'wittle-ittle,' 'footy-wutties,' 'nummies,' 'jammies,' 'make boom-boom,' 'widiculous,' and 'wode iwand.'",michael,17
34119,"Do I sometimes replace Rs with Ws? Yes.  Do I sometimes repeat a word to get my point across?  Well if I do, Andy's sowwy.",andy,27
34120,You can't be a baby in the office.  It makes me look like I hire babies.,michael,17
34121,"Well if I we're complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying.",andy,15
34122,"Okay, who said that?",michael,4
34123,"I don't-just people.  For the record, I think it's pretty fantastic.",andy,12
34124,"[Elvis voice] Well, thank you... thank you a lot.  And for what it's worth I think your baby voice is tops.",michael,22
34125,[baby voice] Tank you Mr. Elwis.,andy,6
34126,"[as Elvis] You're welcome, baby.",michael,5
34127,"Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news.",andy,8
34128,"Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?",jim,8
34129,The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays.,andy,13
34130,"Wow, what do you put our chances at?",jim,8
34131,"0%, unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant, stat!",andy,10
34132,"Hmm, sounds risky.",jim,3
34133,Don't worry.  There is a surefire cure.  Employee of the Month.  Every awesome place I've worked has had one.,andy,22
34134,"Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, my summer at Enron.",andy,9
34135,"Wow, that's not such a bad idea.",jim,7
34136,Great! [sits down],andy,3
34137,Anything else?,jim,2
34138,Nope! [stands up and leaves],andy,5
34140,Keep.,michael,1
34142,I want to keep those so I can see what I sent.,michael,12
34144,Keep.,michael,1
34146,For what?,michael,2
34148,Oh okay.  I don't know how those got on there...,michael,11
34150,Must be hackers.,michael,3
34151,Hey.  What's up?,jim,4
34152,"What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?",michael,20
34153,Did you murder someone?,jim,4
34154,Worse than that.,michael,3
34156,Lurk much?  [Erin leaves] I miss Pam.,michael,8
34157,I think she's okay.,jim,4
34158,Is that what we're going for now?  'okay?'  We used to go for 'pretty good.',michael,17
34159,"Great.  Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?",jim,15
34160,"Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better.  I'm not in this for the trophies, but...",michael,20
34161,"You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager.",jim,17
34162,"Well, technically, I'm a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month.",michael,34
34163,It would look bad.  Sorry.,jim,6
34164,"It would look good, on my mantle.",michael,7
34165,Jim's talking to Michael right now.  They totally went for our idea!,andy,13
34166,Yeah!  Your idea.,dwight,4
34167,"My idea.  I just need Andy to think it's his idea.  So it won't get traced back to me.  In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace.  He will be fired.",dwight,40
34169,[glances at it] Looks great.,pam,5
34171,Okay. [picks up and reads sheet]  The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence?,pam,15
34172,There you are.  I don't think we have finished with my Inbox.,michael,13
34176,"Michael, why did you promise that?",pam,6
34177,To change lives.,michael,3
34178,"No Michael, why would you promise that?",pam,7
34179,"Yeah, okay.  Call the school, cancel.  I can't go through with this.",michael,14
34181,"Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you've done.",pam,9
34182,Well...,michael,1
34183,It's terrible.,pam,2
34184,No.,michael,1
34185,"Just terrible.  And the longer you put it off, the worse it's going to get.",pam,16
34187,"Just tell me it is going to be okay, all right?",michael,11
34188,No!,pam,1
34189,"I'm not a bad person, I bring good news.  Like when I promised those kids I'd pay for college.  Okay, all right.",michael,24
34190,You have to tell them.,pam,5
34191,"Would you come with me?  You know, like old times, instead of... [makes yuck face at Erin]",michael,18
34193,"It's fine.  Erin, you're going to go.  And you're going to make sure Michael tells the truth.",pam,19
34194,"Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse?",michael,11
34195,"Hey Jimmy, what's up?",dwight,4
34196,Not much.,jim,2
34197,"Cool.  Very cool.  I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.",dwight,21
34198,[laughs] Thanks Dwight.,jim,3
34199,That laugh is so infectious.,dwight,5
34200,You're creeping me out.  I'm gonna go.,jim,8
34201,I didn't mean any of those things I just said.  And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud.  Make it about the work.,dwight,42
34202,"Let me guess, you think you should get it.",jim,9
34203,"This encompasses all available data.  Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation.  Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency.  Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.",dwight,35
34204,"Well, in an ideal world...",jim,5
34205,"In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.",dwight,25
34206,"Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away 'Survival Skills' and 'Self-defense.'",jim,18
34207,I'm going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.,dwight,15
34208,"That's okay, I'll do it.",jim,5
34210,"Hey, Mikela Lasker, how are you?",michael,6
34212,Good to see you.  Where's your saxaphone?,michael,8
34214,"Eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of When The Saints Go Marching In that would blow your freaking mind.",michael,20
34216,"Well, you didn't even hear it.",michael,6
34218,"Oh, good.",michael,2
34220,Sure.,michael,1
34223,"Oh, yeah.",michael,2
34225,"No, not at all.  Nope, come on.",michael,8
34226,"Oh, you know what?  You know what?  I shouldn't go in there.  I'm pretty busy, I should just...",michael,21
34228,Oh.,michael,1
34234,Wow!,michael,1
34235,"Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-",dwight,13
34237,So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.,dwight,22
34239,He thought you were doing an incredible job last month.,dwight,10
34241,You seem suprised.,dwight,3
34243,"Hey buddy, so every-",dwight,4
34245,Five minutes ahead of schedule.  Right on schedule.,dwight,9
34248,"[crying] Oh, God.  Oh, God.",michael,6
34249,"Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome.  I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes.  And the winner is, employee number nine.  And that is?",jim,45
34250,"Number nine, number nine.  Jim Halpert.",andy,7
34253,"Oh, no!",dwight,2
34254,"Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-",jim,8
34256,"Guys, listen.  This was anonymous, all right?  There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here.  I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.",jim,41
34258,"Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it.  A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out.  Second of all, there was no cash prize.",jim,34
34260,Dwight?,jim,1
34261,"Yeah, you said 'In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize.'  Isn't that what you said?",dwight,19
34262,"No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money.  But-",jim,15
34269,"Well Zion, I am not going to be paying for your college tuition.  Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybody's tuition.  I'm so, so sorry.",michael,40
34270,I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.,michael,9
34276,"Hey, hold-hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  They're lithium.",michael,12
34277,"Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it.  Okay?  This was your idea anyway.",jim,20
34278,Correction.  It was my idea.,andy,6
34279,Okay.,jim,1
34280,My idea!,dwight,2
34282,"Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesn't Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we'll move on.",pam,34
34284,"Excellent idea, Pam.",dwight,3
34285,Thank you.,pam,2
34286,"That would be employee number three, which would be... son of a bitch, Pam Halpert.",andy,15
34288,There must be some reasonable explanation for this.,dwight,8
34289,"No, wait, come on.  I didn't miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month.",pam,24
34290,"Oh, really? From what, two to four?",andy,7
34291,Yup.,pam,1
34292,"Guys, this isn't some elaborate scam, okay?",jim,7
34294,"Okay.  That is me, but I didn't order the cake.",jim,11
34297,He knew all along!,dwight,4
34300,"[imitating Kevin] This is Kevin Malone, is David there?",dwight,9
34302,"Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam.",dwight,15
34303,[imitating Stanley] This is Stanley Hudson.  Jim Halpert is a menace.,dwight,12
34304,"[imitating Toby] It's Toby Flenderson.  Listen, things are getting really bad down here.",dwight,14
34306,"Erin, can you give us a second?",michael,7
34308,"Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I'm sorry.",michael,10
34310,What can I do?,michael,4
34312,"I can give you an extra laptop battery.  Not everyone took one.  How about this?  If you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay?",michael,36
34314,"Yeah, well, I owe you that at least, right?",michael,9
34316,Really? Wow.  That's over $200 a year.,michael,8
34318,"For-okay, okay here's what I'm gonna do.  I'm going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each.  I'm going to date them one year apart.  Now, you are to use one check a year.  And please call me before you cash the check?  Cause I've got monies to move around.",michael,54

34378,Merry Christmas. Good.,dwight,3
34379,My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph! [laughs] Not really! I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed.,dwight,35
34380,It is time to unveil the tree.,dwight,7
34382,Yeah.,jim,1
34384,This is all we have.,jim,5

34400,"Why would you wrap it in a sheet, if you're not covering anything up?",andy,14

34407,This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas!,dwight,11
34410,I begged Dwight and Jim to give me Erin for Secret Santa. And I decided to give Erin the Twelve days of Christmas. Is it my fault that the first eight days is basically thirty birds? [six geese are inside Erin's car],andy,42
34412,Hey Santa!,dwight,2
34418,"So Santa, what can we expect from this party?",pam,9
34423,"Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!",jim,8
34425,"For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself... in jail!",dwight,55
34426,"You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if it's a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box!",pam,27

34436,Phyllis?,michael,1
34437,Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.,jim,12
34438,Take it back. That is absurd.,michael,6
34439,"No, I'm not gonna do that.",jim,6
34440,No? No! Jim! Come on!,michael,5
34441,I think she's doing a good job.,jim,7
34442,"It's insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesn't it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on!",michael,35
34443,I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can't be Santa.,jim,11
34444,"Fine! Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can- I -you know what, I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those.",michael,31
34446,"[santa voice] Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap. Phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, I'm the real thing. Sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!",michael,48
34448,"No it's not, not like penis-wise. [as Santa] Hello little boy, what's your name?",michael,14
34450,"Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well.",michael,27

34460,"Damn it Kevin, come on.",michael,5
34462,"Okay get off, get off! [pushes Kevin off] Oh! Oh, God!",michael,11
34464,Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesn't have to go through this again.,michael,24
34467,I'm trying Phyllis. You're Santa.,jim,5
34469,That's what I want.,jim,4
34471,What would Bob do?,jim,4

34503,Can I just talk to you for a second?,jim,9
34504,"Whoop! Okay, what?",michael,3
34505,"You can't yell out 'I need this, I need this' as you pin down an employee on your lap!",jim,19
34506,"Okay. You know what Jim, there are two Santas in the room. Things get ruthless!",michael,15
34507,Yup.,jim,1
34508,"Do you understand, you forced my hand?",michael,7
34509,"Michael, it's Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.",jim,8
34510,"Oh, do we? Do 'We?' Is that what 'we' want? Why don't 'we' take a vote on it?",michael,18
34511,Great!,jim,1
34512,Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are--,michael,20
34513,Who wants Phyllis as Santa? [most everyone raises their hand],jim,10
34514,"No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we --[Dwight counts the raised hands] Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me?",michael,29
34516,"And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand. [Michael, then Dwight raises hand]  Can I get you some punch?",jim,22
34517,I'll get some punch. That looks delicious. [shoves Santa hat into punch],michael,12
34519,"Excuse me. Whoever has been sending me the parts to this gun, I think you sent me a gear instead of a trigger.",dwight,23
34521,What else does it look like?,dwight,6
34523,Well I don't have all the pieces yet.,dwight,8
34525,Not a gun. [crosses gun off his 'what could it be' list],dwight,12
34528,"Behold! [extends his arms] Jesus Christ. And I bring to you glad Christmas tidings. I want to remind everyone the true meaning of Christmas.

34530,Oh the Anti-Christ!,michael,3
34532,Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what you're saying?,michael,13
34534,"Well you have to pick one or the other. Your choice. Pick your poison. Get back to me. In the meantime, I am going to spread my goodness all over this company!",michael,32
34535,"Hey Phyllis, could you not reveal to Erin that I'm her Secret Santa?",andy,13
34537,Okay.,andy,1
34539,Have you talked to him?,pam,5
34541,Matt?,pam,1
34543,"Mmm! Good pate, right? [Matt nods yes] Oscar made it. Have you met Oscar?",pam,14

34558,"[on microphone] Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adultery's a sin, look it up in the Bible people. What'd you get?",michael,22
34560,"[on microphone] Oh, that's appropriate. Lot of fire where you're going. Better get used to it. You're going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. You're going to Hell Stanley.",michael,28
34563,"[on microphone] I can't see from here people. Somebody shout it out, don't make me get up.",michael,17

34572,No. [Michael gets up and walks into his office],jim,9
34574,"David, guess who I'm sitting here dressed as.",michael,8
34576,I'll give you a hint. His last name is Christ. He has the power of flight. He can heal leopards.,michael,20
34578,"I'm Jesus, David, and you know why? Because Phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as Santa.",michael,17
34580,What?,michael,1
34582,Really? What's going on?,michael,4
34585,What the hell? How rude! Does she do that all the time?,michael,12

34593,All of us?,michael,3
34595,Oh my God.,michael,3
34596,"Earlier today this office needed a Santa. And then it needed a second Santa. And then it needed a Jesus. And now, it needs a Michael. And that's one suit Phyllis cannot fit into.",michael,34
34597,Hey. How's everybody doing?,michael,4
34598,Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.,jim,11
34599,That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus.,michael,17
34601,"You know what's even more offensive, is baling on this party because some...  jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Here's my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room.",michael,46

34638,I'll call him. I'll call David.,michael,6
34639,"No, you won't, because he's not picking up his phone.",jim,10
34640,"Yes, I will. Because I always know how to get through to him.",michael,13
34641,"He told me where his kids go to school. I call the school, I tell them I'm a pediatrician. They patch me through to his secretary. I use my little girl voice. Badda bing, badda boom.",michael,36

34841,"Dunder Mifflin was recently bought by an electronics company named Sabre. [mispronounced 'sob-ray']  They stepped in at the 11th hour, and they saved our asses.  Although David Wallace said that we were the one branch that was actually working right, so we probably could have saved our own asses. We didn't need them touching our asses.",michael,58
34842,"Oh! [rips open cardboard box] Wow. Awesome. [distributing items] For accounting, a brand new printer. And for the sales staff, a new fax machine. This cord has Creed written all over it. And whoever would like a brand new scanner can come visit it in my office. Thank you.",michael,49
34843,Here we go. [scans stuffed animal] Oh! Wow.,dwight,8
34844,Cool. What next? [Dwight puts his face on scanner],michael,9
34846,"Okay, everybody, listen up. I have some bad news. Due to circumstances beyond my control -",michael,16
34847,Impulsivity and inattention to detail.,dwight,5
34848,"Hey, hey. I have opened a box, which should not have been opened...",michael,13
34849,Terrible mistake.,dwight,2
34850,And distributed things which should not have been distributed.,michael,9
34851,Undistributable.,dwight,1
34852,"Well, maybe we can put the box back together.",pam,9
34853,Impossible. He opened it like an ape.,dwight,7
34855,"[Pam and Oscar are trying to repack cardboard box] Yep, yep.",pam,11
34857,Yep.,pam,1
34859,Yes.,pam,1
34861,"And - [Jim seals box with tape, rips covered with stickers] Wow. Really nice job. This group of people, when they put their minds together, they can do something great. And I think that you should all be proud of yourselves. [cell phone starts ringing from inside box]",michael,48
34862,"Oh, Michael.",pam,2
34863,"Alright, relax. We can do it. We just did it. So we can do this again. Erin, scissor me please. [Erin tosses open scissors across Jim and Pam]",michael,28
34864,"No, don't!",pam,2
34865,[fumbles] Thank you. Oh! Got it. Ok.,michael,7
34866,"Alright, he's on his way up. Okay. Are we ready?",michael,10
34867,What do you want us to do?,pam,7
34868,Why do I have to explain everything?,michael,7
34869,Because we're usually not on the same page.,pam,8
34870,Okay. [starts round of applause],michael,5
34872,Gabe seems tall. Hope we get along. Had a very good thing going with David Wallace. He was a good guy. He was somebody I could trust. Here he is. [holding up photo of him and Wallace] You can really see that he is ok taking a picture with me. Even though I was there for disciplinary reasons.,michael,58
34873,Welcome. Scranton hot dog from Scranton?,dwight,6
34874,"You know what, Dwight? Let's give him a minute to settle in, shall we? Ok?",michael,15
34876,"Hello, Gabe. I am Michael Scott, co-manager. This is my protege, Jim Halpert.",michael,13
34877,"Co-manager, actually.",jim,2
34878,In training.,michael,2
34879,Trained. Loving it. Good at it. So...,jim,7
34881,"We're very excited too, aren't we guys? Right?",michael,8
34882,So excited.,dwight,2
34883,We have a little song prepared for you.,michael,8
34885,Sabre. Say-ber. Sabre.,michael,3
34886,Oh. Of course.,dwight,3
34887,"Yes, say-ber. Good. Take it away guys.",michael,7
34888,Ok. [playing guitar to the tune of Miley Cyrus' Party in the USA],andy,13
34890,Saber.,michael,1
34891,"Saber. [sings] Dunder Mifflin and Saber. So yeah, yeah, yay, yay.",andy,11
34893,You sure it's saber?,andy,4
34894,Hey.,pam,1
34895,"Thank you. Hey, we should be fine if we leave around 11:20.",jim,12
34896,"Oh, you mapquested it. It's four blocks away.",pam,8
34897,"Well, now we won't get lost. Or we could drive. And that takes one minute.",jim,15
34898,We found a great local daycare. It's rated really high by all the local parenting websites. But that means it's also really hard to get into.,pam,26
34899,"Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That's weird.",jim,15
34900,We're hoping our interview seals the deal.,pam,7
34901,"But if not, there's always the army. The infantry.",jim,9
34902,Okay. Okay. Yeah.,pam,3
34905,"[Christian Slater impression] So you've been shown a nonsensical video. You're probably wondering, 'What's going on?' Well, you're not alone.",jim,20
34906,Wow. Really terrific.,michael,3
34908,Perfect.,michael,1
34909,No. Don't like that.,michael,4
34917,"Mm, nope. Don't like that.",michael,5
34919,"We'll still get to use the little cups, though, right?",michael,10
34921,I don't know what they're made of.,michael,7
34922,They're 2 ounce paper cups dipped in plastic. He goes through 20 a day.,dwight,14
34924,"You know what can't fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everything's running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley.",michael,43
34927,[in line to fill up water bottle behind Kevin and Toby] Really? You don't have enough water in there? Your stomach?,michael,21
34929,What?,michael,1
34931,I miss the old Dunder Mifflin. Too much change is not a good thing. Ask the climate.,michael,17
34932,I don't want to appear ungrateful for everything Sabre's doing for us.,michael,12
34934,"Well, you should have a little. But it's great that you don't, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I'm - I'll be honest, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of 'em.",michael,39
34936,All of them.,michael,3
34938,So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I'm good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?,michael,21
34940,"[after entering daycare] Ok, this is officially the cutest thing I've ever seen. Cubbies. I totally forgot about cubbies.",jim,19
34941,There's a finger-painting station and a curly slide. Am I too old to go here?,pam,15
34942,"Oh. Adorable, right? [opens kiddie bathroom, sees man on toilet] I walked in on someone in the bathroom.",jim,18
34943,What?,pam,1
34944,I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.,jim,9
34945,Who? The -,pam,3
34946,I don't know. I don't know.,jim,6
34947,The guy we're meeting with?,pam,5
34948,"I don't know, I don't know.",jim,6
34949,"I am telling you, there are no strawberries in here.",andy,10
34951,"Well maybe they ran away, because the pizza was like, [imitating Italian accent] 'Hey, get out of here, you stupid strawberries.'",andy,21
34953,The ball's totally in Erin's court. After the whole drum line thing.,andy,12
34960,Hello. No. My name's Michael Scott. Hello.,michael,7
34962,Nice to meet you. We are very excited about the merger with Sabre. I think you have a great accent.,michael,20
34964,"Well, I am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank. I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and -",michael,33
34966,Ok. I feel very strongly that you can't just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever. Is Christian Slater back there? Because... he knows. He'd know what to do.,michael,34
34968,"I have already told him, but I will tell him again if you think that will help.",michael,17
34971,Hi Jerry.,pam,2
34972,Jerry.,jim,1
34974,"This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -",jim,21
34976,"No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular.",jim,30
34977,It's lovely.,pam,2
34979,Do it.,jim,2
34981,"Ok, you've got to pull it together.",pam,7
34982,We should just go. He's really uncomfortable.,jim,7
34983,He's uncomfortable because you're acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.,pam,13
34984,What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?,jim,15
34985,That's the weirdest possible solution to the problem.,pam,8
34987,All right.,jim,2
34988,"I have come here today to talk to Mr. David Wallace about this whole thing going on with Sabre. [rings doorbell] He will know exactly what to do. He is not a big fan of me dropping by announced. But then again, who is? [loud drumming as door opens] Hey. Hi, sorry.",michael,52
34990,I hope you're not busy doing something.,michael,7
34992,You sure?,michael,2
34994,You look great too.,michael,4
34996,"Oh, yeah, that sounds good.",michael,5
34999,Hey. Wow.,michael,2
35001,Really loud.,michael,2
35002,"Wow. Oh, yummy. [David spreads marshmallow fluff on bread] You have got the life, my friend.",michael,16
35004,Can I just stay here and never go back?,michael,9
35006,"Oh, man. How much time do you have?",michael,8
35008,Yeah.,michael,1
35013,"Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd come by, see...",michael,13
35015,I don't know.,michael,3
35017,"There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.",jim,30
35019,"Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.",jim,28
35021,Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?,pam,12
35022,What?,jim,1
35024,Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.,jim,13
35026,No.,jim,1
35027,"Maybe, because it doesn't seem to be going super well.",pam,10
35029,Nope. 'Cause we're really nice people but you don't seem to like us.,pam,13
35031,"Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?",jim,20
35033,Anybody could have walked in.,jim,5
35035,"Sabre is changing everything. [Michael and David sitting in hot tub] Site blockers. They don't let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? David Wallace would know what to do. What should I do, David Wallace?",michael,46
35037,Exactly. What are you thinking?,michael,5
35039,It is a tough one.,michael,5
35041,Yeah. But one would be good.,michael,6
35043,Okay.,michael,1
35045,Okay.,michael,1
35047,So the kid's making the noise to pick it up.,michael,10
35049,"Oh, okay.",michael,2
35051,"No, I think it is-",michael,5
35053,Yep.,michael,1
35055,"Hey, any fun weekend plans?",andy,5
35057,"Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to?",andy,18
35059,Okay.,andy,1
35060,That's as hard as I can hint.,andy,7
35062,The what?,michael,2
35064,"Oh, okay.",michael,2
35066,Like it.,michael,2
35067,There are very few things that would make me not want to team up with David Wallace. And Suck It is one of 'em.,michael,24
35068,See you later. [hugs Wallace],michael,5
35070,Bye now.,michael,2
35072,Thanks for having me.,michael,4
35073,"Well, that's not the David Wallace that I remember. [reverses out of driveway, Wallace follows him] That is some sort of weird creature that lives in David Wallace's house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here.",michael,39
35074,"Hello. [comes in carrying 4 gallons of orange juice and his water bottle] Is anybody home? Oh, thank you, Erin. Now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so I can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of Gabe's homeland, and then propose a toast. Here we go.",michael,49
35075,You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That's the best thing? Really? Ugh.,michael,28
35076,"Well, I'm not really one for making speeches.",michael,8
35078,But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you.,michael,21
35080,No. This is my toast.  I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it.,michael,26
35082,"Here's my toast. Orange juice is in here. And, like Saber, it is from Florida, and it is good.",michael,19
35084,Here's the toast. I'm gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.,michael,16
35086,"Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. That's like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesn't it? Okay, anyway, welcome.",michael,23
35102,"Hello Vancouver, this is Michael Scott calling from the United States of America!  I have a reservation in your fair city from February 12th to the 19th, first week of the Olympics.",michael,33
35104,Okey doke.,michael,2
35106,What?,michael,1
35107,[looking through Michael's email] I'm not seeing anything under 'confirmation.',dwight,10
35108,No.,michael,1
35109,Could it be under 'affirmation?' Cause you have thousands of those.,dwight,11
35110,No. [to hotel employee on phone] We're trying to look it up right now.,michael,14
35111,You [i]did[/i] get the e-vite to my barbeque!,dwight,8
35112,"Um, come on.",michael,3
35113,Michael...,dwight,1
35115,"Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I've always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation.",michael,33
35116,"Wait, I got it! Confirmation code: XV2RDM!",dwight,7
35118,Oh.,michael,1
35119,Thank you.,dwight,2
35121,That's it!,michael,2
35125,"Alright, I would like to cancel my reservation, please.",michael,9
35127,"Okay, put it on my card.",michael,6
35128,"Today, Jo Bennett, the CEO from Sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time. She bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so she's gotta be kinda nervous. I mean, are we ugly? Are we smart? Are we cool? Are we too cool? Do we speak English?",michael,51
35129,"[Jo Bennett enters with two humongous dogs, everyone stands to welcome her except Dwight] Why hello!",michael,16
35131,"Pleasure to meet you, Miss Bennett.",michael,6
35133,[Jo's dogs are sniffing at his crotch] These sure are pretty dogs...,andy,12
35135,They sure do.,andy,3
35137,"Oh, I do!",andy,3
35139,Hello.,dwight,1
35141,"I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy.",dwight,24
35152,Got some Valentine's cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers.,andy,10
35155,"Valentine's Day, right around the corner. Erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a Valentine's Day card, but I didn't wanna seem 'too eager,' so I got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit.",andy,47
35156,"[throwing a card at Meredith, which skims her throat]: Look alive.",andy,11
35159,"Jo, I don't know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job.",michael,44
35160,"Whoa, whoa.",jim,2
35161,"Whoa, whoa!",michael,2
35162,"I'll take over. Um, what we're doing here: Michael handles more of the 'big-picture' stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together...",jim,25
35164,Alright.,jim,1
35166,No.,jim,1
35167,And sometimes I can hardly handle that!,michael,7
35169,I don't think so.,jim,4
35171,Forget the question...,michael,3
35173,I humbly accept the management position.,michael,6
35174,I... Why would you just say something like that?,jim,9
35175,"Because, well, Jim. Where I'm from, two types of folk: those who ain't, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain't you ain't? Ya'll come back now.",michael,30
35176,Do you even know what that means?,jim,7
35177,Yes.,michael,1
35179,Um...,jim,1
35182,"[almost running into Erin] Whoa-oh, traffic jam!",andy,7
35184,[imitating car noises] Beep-beep! Beeooop-beep!,andy,5
35186,"There's blood everywhere! Um, I got you a Valentine's card.",andy,10
35188,"Yeah, well it's Snoopy and Woodstock.",andy,6
35190,"Uh, Charles Schultz did. I thought it was relevant cause I got you all those birds for Christmas, remember?",andy,19
35192,"Oh, look at that. They sure do. I hadn't noticed.",andy,10
35194,"Yeah! It's Roger Federer for men, I sprayed some in there.",andy,11
35196,It's got pheromones in it.,andy,5
35202,"No, we know. Texas!",michael,4
35204,I could manage my way around that.,michael,7
35206,I will try to manage my excitement!,michael,7
35207,"I have been saying the word 'manager' a lot, so whenever Jo thinks 'manager' she thinks of me. Camel cigarettes did the same thing with Joe Camel by making him look like a penis. I can't even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a penis. And vise-versa.",michael,49
35209,"[Jo leaves] I, uh...",dwight,4
35212,"So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.",pam,33
35213,This is way more than I make now.,jim,8
35214,"I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.",jim,43
35215,"Hey, you got a second?",jim,5
35216,Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?,michael,25
35217,"Actually, yeah.",jim,2
35218,What?,michael,1
35219,Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.,jim,15
35220,What? Really?,michael,2
35221,Yeah!,jim,1
35222,Wow!,michael,1
35223,"La la la, hello Oscar!",michael,5
35225,What are you reading?,michael,4
35227,"Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again.",michael,40
35229,"Why, is there an untapped gay market?",michael,7
35231,...Where did you get that information.,michael,6
35233,Manuel who?,michael,2
35234,"Well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled.",michael,15
35235,Son of a bitch. [enters conference room] Pardon me.,michael,9
35237,Okay.,michael,1
35239,"Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales.",michael,28
35241,Really.,jim,1
35242,"Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you can't take the sales out of salesman.",michael,19
35244,"No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.",jim,15
35245,"No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people.",michael,19
35246,Why would you do that?,jim,5
35247,I'm turning myself in right now!,michael,6
35249,Thank you.,michael,2
35251,"Great! That's great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss.",michael,11
35252,"[pointing to the window in Michael's office] Oh, Michael marked his heights. He's grown!",pam,14
35253,Mm!,jim,1
35254,"[on phone] Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds. [hangs up phone] 89... 88...",dwight,32
35255,You're twenty minutes late!,dwight,4
35257,Just admit you lost track of time.,dwight,7
35258,Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair.,dwight,28
35260,Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.,dwight,11
35262,"Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw.",dwight,12
35264,I like where you're going with this. Continue.,dwight,8
35266,I have an old barn!,dwight,5
35268,"It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?",dwight,12
35270,"Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!",dwight,22
35272,He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think!,dwight,8
35274,Think!,dwight,1
35277,How is that possible?,michael,4
35279,"No excuses Erin, come on! Make it happen.",michael,8
35281,"Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers? [Michael's phone rings] Michael Scott, head of sales.",michael,31
35282,"[on phone] You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there.",jim,12
35283,The new IT guy. Nick.,dwight,5
35285,"I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.",dwight,30
35287,"Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?",dwight,13
35289,Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum.,dwight,6
35290,I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.,dwight,11
35292,What is that?,jim,3
35294,"Oh. I'm fine. Thank you, though.",jim,6
35296,Why would I wanna do that?,jim,6
35298,"For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here...",jim,10
35300,Yeah. Thank you.,jim,3
35304,"You know, we really don't announce out loud our sales that much.",dwight,12
35305,Why not? It's part of the sales experience.,michael,8
35306,It's not really 1992 anymore.,dwight,5
35307,"Well, okay...",michael,2
35315,"Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room.",dwight,13
35317,"I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone's computer passwords.",dwight,20
35319,"Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.",dwight,43
35321,"No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert's computer.",dwight,19
35326,What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here?,michael,17
35327,"Michael, stop.",pam,2
35328,"No, I'm serious, we don't have to put up... Is it the dogs?",michael,13
35329,Michael...,pam,1
35330,"You know what, we don't have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps.",michael,17
35331,"Michael, it's Phyllis.",dwight,3
35332,"No, this is geological.",michael,4
35334,Are you kidding me?,michael,4
35336,And you guys are okay with this?,michael,7
35337,"She sent an email, so.",dwight,5
35339,[has two tissues in his nostrils] It's not cause of the smell. I'm just expecting a nosebleed.,andy,17
35340,Oh my God.,michael,3
35342,"I'm sorry, I thought you saw me.",andy,7
35344,"Cool, thanks.",andy,2
35346,...That was weird.,andy,3
35348,I don't even know what that card said.,andy,8
35350,Hey.,michael,1
35351,Hey.,jim,1
35352,"You know, it's funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I'm out there, and I wish I was in here.",michael,27
35353,"Well, the grass is always greener.",jim,6
35354,Yeah. Except there's no grass out there. It's just a farty dirt patch.,michael,13
35355,"Well, it's what you wanted.",jim,5
35356,I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.,michael,12
35357,"For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do.",jim,16
35358,"We make a poster that says 'Happy Opposite Day!' and she sees it on the way out... Nah, that's stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black.",michael,34
35359,"Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her.",jim,20
35360,Lethal Weapon?,michael,2
35361,That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.,jim,12
35363,What? What I'm saying...,michael,4
35364,"Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly.",jim,17
35365,"And weirdly I'm a good dog person, right guys? [dogs go to him] See? They love me.",michael,17
35367,Alright.,jim,1
35368,Alright!,michael,1
35370,"[Erin leaves room] Excuse me? Everyone? Please check your emails, I just sent you the following message: 'Coworkers, you may have received a Valentine from me. Please understand this does not mean that I like you in any way.'",andy,39
35372,"Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I don't like-like you.",andy,15
35374,"Please don't read into this card. Yours in professionalism, Nard dog.'",andy,11
35376,It's n-- that wasn't... I like someone else.,andy,8
35378,"It's not... Whether or not, you...",andy,6
35381,"Oh, it smells good in here.",michael,6
35383,"Erin, what about my keyboard? [Erin hits a button on an electronic keyboard, playing a beat] Aw, so good to be home. How about a little Bosa Nova?",michael,28
35385,[gesturing to Michael dancing in his office] He looks happy.,pam,10
35386,Yep.,jim,1
35387,"Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he [Jim dunks Dwight's tie in his coffee cup, Pam smiles] what? Michael!",dwight,54
35388,[entering elevator with Ryan] I can't help but think that something we did made this possible.,dwight,16
35390,"Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?",dwight,21
35392,Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.,dwight,8
35394,"It is not 'farm boy swill,' I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious.",dwight,18
35396,"[on the phone with a client] I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave...  Yeah, I'm pregnant...  Great, well, I'll write up the order.  Okay, thanks.",pam,40
35397,Wait a minute!  You can't do that.  You cannot exploit your baby for sales.,dwight,16
35398,"[on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  I'm excited.  Oh, definitely.",jim,27
35399,"No, no!  You need to come by your sales honorably!",dwight,11
35400,There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life.  People like it.,pam,13
35402,"I need a baby.  I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one.  Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life.  Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.",dwight,32
35403,"Kevin, you're such a gourmand.",pam,5
35405,Hmm.,pam,1
35408,"Mmmm, that sounds great.  What are you thinking?",pam,9
35411,"No, no.  I still have time.",pam,7
35412,"I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart.  So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor.",pam,19
35413,"Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.",jim,9
35414,"If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.",pam,16
35415,"Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.",jim,50
35416,I cannot wait for that joke to be over.,pam,9
35417,Ooh.,pam,1
35418,"Oh, oh, oh!  Contraption!  She's contrapting!  Okay, you know what?  I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why.  I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania.  I gassed up the car...",michael,46
35419,Michael.,jim,1
35420,"Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.",michael,12
35421,"Michael, you shouldn't have done that.",jim,6
35422,"Happy to do it.  Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.",michael,16
35423,"You know the baby's not going to live here, right?",pam,10
35424,"Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.",michael,16
35425,"Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.",jim,14
35426,"Oh, yuck!  TMI!  How was it?  I don't want to know.  Tell me later.  Let's go!  Let's go!  Hospital!",michael,26
35427,"Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital.  We are waiting until midnight.",pam,14
35429,Because the insurance company only covers two nights.,jim,8
35430,Everything's fine.  We have plenty of time.,pam,8
35432,"Shut up, Nick.  What a weird thing to say.  Weird I.T. nerd.  Don't get revenge on me, nerd.",michael,21
35434,"Ha, nerd.",dwight,2
35436,[with Angela in the break room]  Bare my child.,dwight,10
35438,"I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother.  If you agree, say nothing.  If you disagree, say anything...  Very well.  Let's meet at 4:00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.",dwight,47
35439,[after Pam has another contraction]  That's seven minutes.  Here we go.  This is happening.  Come on.,jim,20
35440,"Hold on, hold on.  It isn't midnight yet.",pam,9
35441,Are you serious?  Pam.,jim,5
35442,"No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.",pam,9
35443,"I...  Pam, please.",jim,4
35444,"I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.",pam,14
35445,"Yeah, no, you really should.  Because if your baby's born tomorrow, he's going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks.  My old roommate.",andy,26
35446,Did you hear that?  Butt-mud Brooks.,pam,7
35447,"Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.",jim,9
35448,Five minutes apart.,pam,3
35449,"So, the plan was seven minutes.  But we're calling an audible, because that's her call.  Because she's the quarterback.  I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.",jim,33
35450,"Okay, stop watching me.",pam,4
35451,"Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.",jim,22
35452,Mm-hmm.,pam,1
35453,"Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal.  While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?",jim,35
35454,Not until midnight.,pam,3
35455,"Guys.  Word of advice.  Speaking as a former baby.  Don't get too hung up on baby names.  I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds.",andy,42
35457,"My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him.  I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.",andy,35
35458,"You know, it's getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.",jim,24
35459,"No, no, no, no, no.  You know what?  You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.",michael,23
35460,"[as Andy and Kevin shout 'yeah!' in response to Michael] Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals.",jim,30
35461,"Actually, the distractions are good.  I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it.",pam,26
35462,"Distractions are good!  That means conference room, five minutes!  No, no, five seconds!  Right now, right now!  Conference room!  Topic, potpourri!  Let's go!",michael,29
35463,"Um, I am sort of a master of distraction.  When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class.  Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies?  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  [Michael covers his mouth and makes fart noises.]",michael,58
35464,The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam's mind off of what's going on inside of her body.,michael,19
35465,Can we do sleight of hand tricks?,andy,7
35466,I will allow that.,michael,4
35467,Yes!  Can anyone do those?,andy,6
35469,"[as Pam has another contraction]  Oh!  Oh, alright.  That's a good one.",jim,15
35470,"Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys.  Just, um, keep talking.",pam,10
35471,Okay.,michael,1
35473,"Oh, thanks, Kelly.",pam,3
35474,"Does anybody have anything?  Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?",michael,12
35475,"Yes, this is the only time I'm ever going to make this request.",pam,13
35476,"Yes, Phyl?",michael,2
35478,"[ as Pam shakes her head] Nope, nope, I don't think anybody wants to see that.",michael,16
35479,I can do the evolution of dance-dance.,andy,7
35480,"[as Pam gives the thumbs up]  That sounds good!  Do you need some music, or...?  Okay.",michael,19
35481,"Nope, actually music would just throw me off.  I need complete silence.  Okay...  [Pam begins to clap as Andy dances]  You're clapping.  I need complete silence.  Totally threw me off, so I'm going to have to start over.  Evolution of dance-dance.",andy,48
35485,Have a seat.,dwight,3
35487,"Before we conceive a child, uh, it is important that we bang out a parenting contract.",dwight,16
35489,It's been a long time since we've come down here separately.,dwight,11
35491,"Now, then.  Let's get to it, shall we?  Item one:  [speaking into a voice recorder] Child will be breast fed by the mother for exactly six months, then weaned onto a nutrient-rich winter vegetable mash provided by the father, Dwight Schrute, hereafter referred to as Morpheus.  Agreed?",dwight,51
35493,"[as Pam has another contraction]  Where are we?  We have every six minutes, ladies and gentlemen.  Another seventy five contractions and you are going to be there.",michael,30
35495,"Okay, you know what?  I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call.  He'd probably know...",jim,20
35496,"Jim, please.  Happy thoughts here.  Happy times.",pam,9
35497,"Yeah, happy times.  Come on.  Let's have happy times.",michael,11
35498,Alright.,jim,1
35499,"Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor.  And I'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor.  Erin, read the first one.",michael,40
35501,"Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples.  Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle.",michael,13
35504,"Okay, yeah, why don't you go get it?",michael,8
35506,"Okay, the opposite of that?",michael,5
35508,"Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Come on, let's go to the hospital.  Pam, let's go to the hospital right now.",jim,21
35509,"Jim, Jim, honey, I love you, but you're really distracting me from my distractions.",pam,14
35510,"Mm-hmm.  Okay, great.  Well, sorry.",jim,7
35511,Why don't you go do some work?,pam,7
35512,"Great.  I will do that.  Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.  And you know how very rarely I use that word.  Frazzled.",jim,29
35513,"I know, you don't like to be frazzled.",pam,8
35514,"No, I don't.",jim,3
35515,Okay.,pam,1
35516,"Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now.  Totally.",jim,16
35517,"Ooh, someone's freakin'.",michael,3
35518,A little frazzled.,andy,3
35519,I think he is.,michael,4
35521,Acceptable names include and are limited to:  Ebenezer.,dwight,9
35523,Jonas.,dwight,1
35525,Warf.,dwight,1
35527,Okay.  Fine.,dwight,3
35529,"Irrelevant question.  Section 5A, child shall be male.",dwight,9
35531,Yes you can.,dwight,3
35533,"It's as simple as keeping the womb extremely warm for two days after sex, and then extremely cold for five months.",dwight,21
35535,[Pam approaches as he sits in his car]  Hey.,jim,10
35536,"Hey.  I'm not going to get in the car, because I know if I do you'll try to drive me to the hospital.",pam,24
35537,"Ah, you know me too well.",jim,6
35538,"Okay, Jim.",pam,2
35539,Yeah?  ...  Oh.,jim,5
35540,"Everything is fine.  You don't have to worry.  Try not to think about it.  She's not coming out for a while, okay?",pam,25
35541,Did you say 'she?',jim,4
35542,"I called the doctor like a week ago.  I couldn't wait...  Oh, God, don't be mad.",pam,18
35543,Mad?  How could I be mad?  We're having a little girl.,jim,13
35544,Mm-hmm.,pam,1
35545,"Wow, we're having a little girl.  Oh, man.",jim,9
35546,I know.,pam,2
35547,"Woo, alright.  Well, I definitely feel better.",jim,8
35548,Good.,pam,1
35549,Yeah.,jim,1
35550,Okay.,pam,1
35551,"Alright...  Hey, did you change?",jim,6
35552,"Oh, yeah, my water broke.",pam,5
35553,Oh.  Oh...,jim,3
35554,"[enters the office and has another contraction]  Oh, whoa.  Ha.  Wow.",pam,14
35555,"Pam, Pam!  Okay, alright, okay, it's time.  Time to go to the hospital.  Somebody get Jim, please!  Is it midnight yet?",michael,25
35557,"4:35.  Alright, almost made it.  Almost made it.  Too bad you didn't have sex like seven and a half hours later.  But you had to have the afternoon delight.  I understand.  Sometimes you have to go for it.  Let's go to the hospital, shall we?",michael,52
35558,"No, not yet, Michael.",pam,4
35559,We can do...,michael,3
35560,"Oh, wow, it's almost time for ultra feast!  Where's Kevin?",pam,11
35561,Oh.  What?  You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?,michael,18
35563,What is October feast?,michael,4
35564,"There is no rush to get to the hospital.  I am fine.  I'll get there.  And if I don't get there, I don't get there.",pam,28
35566,"Mm-hmm.  Yes, I'm fine.  Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.",pam,25
35567,"Okay, okay, Jim.  I think this feast is over and it's time to go to the hospital.",michael,18
35568,Alright.  Time to go.  Okay.,jim,7
35569,"That's right, let's do this.",michael,5
35570,Let's give it a shot.,jim,5
35571,"Nope.  No, no, that's better.  That wasn't even the worst of them.  I'm fine.",pam,17
35572,"Hey, come on.  Let's go to the hospital.",jim,9
35573,"They're not that bad still, babe.",pam,6
35574,"Pam, Pam, it's time.  Let's go to the hospital.",jim,10
35575,"No, it's passing, it's fine.  It's okay.",pam,8
35576,"Come on, Michael says we should go now.",jim,8
35577,"Let's go, Pam.  Yeah, I think we should head out.",michael,11
35578,"No, it's passing, it's fine.",pam,5
35579,Pam.,jim,1
35580,"Ah, no, it passed.  It's good.",pam,7
35581,You know what?  Let's go.  We got to go to the hospital.,jim,14
35582,"Okay, I'm not going.  I'm not...  It's fine.   [Jim, Michael and Kevin try to help her up] Okay, come on, come on.  No!  I am not going!  I am not going, okay!?  I'm not going today because I can't do it, I don't think I can do it.",pam,56
35583,"Hey, are you kidding me?",jim,5
35584,Are you kidding?,michael,3
35585,"If anyone can do this, you can do this.",jim,9
35586,You can do this.  You can do this.,michael,9
35587,"Pam, I'm scared.  I'm real scared.",jim,7
35588,"I'm scared, too.",michael,3
35590,"The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.",jim,11
35591,Yeah.,michael,1
35592,A really awesome baby.,jim,4
35593,We're going to have a baby.,michael,6
35594,So let's have it at the hospital.,jim,7
35595,Let's do that.,michael,3
35596,How are we doing on contractions?,jim,6
35597,Two minutes apart.,michael,3
35598,Two minutes...,jim,2
35599,"Oh, God.  Oh, no.",pam,5
35600,"Michael, I told you.",jim,4
35601,It's okay.,michael,2
35602,"No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.",jim,10
35603,"Jim, we waited too long!",pam,5
35604,"I know, I know, I know.  It went by too soon.",michael,12
35605,"We waited too long!  Two minutes doesn't do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?",jim,21
35606,"We're okay, Jim!  Okay, Pamela.  You know what time it is?",michael,13
35607,I don't want to have my baby here.,pam,8
35608,You're not going to.  You know where you're going?,michael,10
35609,The hospital.,pam,2
35610,"Yes, you are.  And you know what you're going to have?",michael,12
35611,A baby.,pam,2
35612,Yes!  We're going to the hospital and we're going to have a baby.,michael,14
35613,"I got it!  I got it!  Everybody it's go time!  At your stations.  Stanley, man the phones.  Meredith, please, get bottled water.  Erin, call an ambulance, please!",michael,33
35614,"No, no, no.  Ambulances are emergencies only.  You call an ambulance, I call the cops.",dwight,17
35615,"Alright, we're driving ourselves, actually.",jim,5
35616,"No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive.  I will drive you.  Check!  Got it.",michael,19

35620,Go bag! Where's my go bag?  Where's my go bag?,michael,11
35622,"You are telling me now that there is nothing in it.  Okay, great!  Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?",michael,27
35624,Has anyone checked how dilated she is?  This is ridiculous!,dwight,11
35625,"Dwight, get away!",pam,3
35626,"No, no, no.  Dwight, let Jim do that, please.",michael,10
35628,[as he holds up the tape measure with his initials on it] 'We' don't.,dwight,14
35629,"Okay, I can't find my keys!  I cannot find my keys!  Found 'em.  They're here.",jim,18
35633,Thank you!  Wish me luck!,michael,6
35636,[entering the elevator] Here we go!  Here we go!  On our way!,michael,14
35638,"Come on, Stanley!  Okay.  We're going now!",michael,9
35640,"No, no, no, no!  Out, out!  Idiot.",michael,9
35641,"Dwight, what is the traffic like?",michael,6
35642,Doesn't matter.  I'll escort you!,dwight,6
35643,Alright.,michael,1
35644,Let's go!,dwight,2
35645,"Geesh, Dwight!",michael,2
35646,[as he peels out of the parking lot and stops] Michael!,dwight,11
35647,What!?,michael,1
35648,This is where I saw that deer last week.,dwight,9
35649,Where?,michael,1
35650,Right over by that fence.,dwight,5
35651,By the bushes?,michael,3
35652,"Okay, Michael!  Focus!",jim,4
35653,"Okay, go, go, go, go!",michael,5
35654,Let's go!,dwight,2
35655,"I love escorting people.  In fact, a few years back, I put an ad in the paper starting an escort service.  I got a lot of responses.  Mostly creeps.  Made a few friends.",dwight,37
35656,"Alright, here we go!  You're doing great!  She'll be here soon.",jim,13
35657,"Okay, just breathe...  She?  You found out?  Come on, guys.  I wanted to be surprised.",michael,19

35661,"Michael, come on!",jim,3
35662,"I'm texting about you, okay!?",michael,5
35663,"Ugh, alright.  [as he puts a police siren on top of his car]  Let's move!  ...  What?",dwight,21
35665,Are you kidding me?,dwight,4
35667,"Wait, wait.  My iPod's not in here!",pam,8
35668,Okay.,jim,1
35669,It has the birth song on it!,pam,7
35670,"Okay.  I know, I know.  But my iPod is in the go bag.  We'll be fine.",jim,19
35671,"Jim, I don't want the first thing the baby hears to be the 8 Mile soundtrack.",pam,16
35672,"Okay, so what do you want to do?",jim,8
35673,I don't know!  Let's go by the house and get it.  It's only twenty minutes past the hospital!,pam,20
35674,"Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  We're going to the hospital now.",jim,13
35675,"Guys, guys!  Stop fighting, come on.  Come on.  Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer?  Right?  Okay, you know what?  I am all over this.  Here we go.  [as he calls Dwight]  Ready?",michael,45
35676,Dwight Schrute.,dwight,2
35677,"Hello, Dwight.  Pam left her iPod at her house.  I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital.  We need it yesterday.",michael,31
35678,Why didn't you ask me to do it yesterday?  I kept IM'ing you how bored I was.,dwight,18
35679,Okay.,michael,1
35680,Dwight!  Go to my house.  Get my iPod.  I think it's on the kitchen table.  Do not touch anything else.  The key is under...,pam,29

35689,"Michael, just go park the car.",jim,6
35690,"Okay, alright.  [he parks in an ambulance zone]",michael,9
35692,Dunder-Mifflin.  It's okay.  [he throws the keys into bushes across the street]  I just did.,michael,18
35695,Okay.,jim,1
35696,"Where is my little nibblet?  Halpert, room D1.  Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you.  Here we go.",michael,22
35697,"[as Pam screams]  Doing great, push again.",jim,8
35699,"No, don't push.  Pull.  Pull.",jim,7
35701,"No, Jim, stay!",pam,3
35703,Okay.,pam,1
35704,"[looking horrified as he walks from the room back into the lobby]  Okay, not yet, not yet.  I'm going to go wash my eyes.",michael,26
35705,That kid's going to have a lot of hair.,michael,9
35706,"Hey, have you guys seen her?",andy,6
35708,What?  God damn it.  She was supposed to come out yesterday.,andy,13
35709,"I decided to give baby Halpert a newspaper from the day she was born.  This frame set me back fifty five bones.  But she decided to take her sweet time, so now I have to switch it with today's paper.",andy,42
35711,I think it's going to be any minute now.,michael,9
35713,"Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?",michael,8
35715,"Oh, my God.  Go, go, go!  Are you insane?  Alright.",michael,13
35716,"[Pam screams as he approaches the door to their room]  Guys?  Hello?  Um, sorry to be a bother, but if we could have an ETA when this is gonna...",michael,32
35717,This is happening!,pam,3
35718,"You're starting, you're kinda losing them.",michael,6
35719,"Oh, my God!  Look at her!  baby, she's so beautiful!  Oh, my God.",jim,16
35720,"Oh, my God.",pam,3
35721,"[smoking a cigar]  Yeah, that's right.  It's a baby, see?",michael,12
35723,Okay.  You can't smoke anywhere these days.,michael,8
35724,"[with Jim, holding the baby]  She's incredible.  Want to count her fingers and toes again?",pam,17
35725,"No, let's let her rest.  I'm sure there's still twelve on each.",jim,13
35726,Okay.,pam,1
35727,"Guys, guys!",michael,2
35728,Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.,jim,6
35729,Eleven pounds...,michael,2
35730,"She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches.  Mother and daughter are doing great.",jim,14
35732,Thank you!  Thank you!,michael,5
35735,"Hey, grandma's back.",jim,3
35737,Great.,jim,1
35738,"Oh, thank God.  I haven't had caffeine in nine months.",pam,11
35740,Oh.  Let me get it.,jim,6
35741,I am a diapering master.  I have done little else in the past two months.  There is nothing I cannot diaper.  Go ahead.  Try to think of something.  I dare you.,jim,36
35742,"Where's the baby?  I want to see the baby.  Oh!  Oh, Helene, hi.  Oh, my goodness, what are the odds of this?  Congratulations on being a grandma.",michael,32
35744,"Hello.  Oh, good for you.  I worry about you.",michael,11

35748,"Love you, as a friend.",michael,5
35749,"Love you, mom.",pam,3
35750,"Ooh, I want to hold the baby!",michael,7
35751,"Okay, you just have to use the hand sanitizer first.",pam,10
35752,Alright.,michael,1
35753,"Again, no pants.",pam,3
35754,"Oh, okay.",michael,2
35755,Ready?,jim,1
35756,"Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Ooh, wow.  Michael.  Michael.",michael,10
35757,"It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.",jim,12
35759,"There she sat.  Her name was Pam.  She was a receptionist.  She was engaged to an animal.  There sat Jim.  He was a gawky, tall salesman.  The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able.  I made a family!  I got these two together, and I made a family.",michael,56
35760,This man has a gift!,andy,5
35761,Who else here is single?,michael,5
35763,"I am offering up my services to you all.  You saw what I did with Pam and Jim.  I can help you, too.",michael,25
35765,"Okay, show of hands.  Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any?  [Stanley raises his hand]  Who else?  Come on!  People, I know models!",michael,38
35767,"Ha ha, you got that right!  Meredith?  Come on, you're obviously single.",michael,14
35770,"Andrew, what about you?",michael,4
35771,"Torn scrotum.  Still on the mend, so not good timing.",andy,11
35772,"Yes, I'm going to ask out Erin.  I'm just waiting for the stars to align.  Literally.  I have a small skylight in my bedroom, and I'd like for the moon to be visible.",andy,36
35773,"Well, when you least expect it, expect it.  I am going to fill the empty voids in your life with love.  I am going to fill that empty hole in your body with another person.  And, like Cupid, I am going to shoot you with love.",michael,49
35774,Remember yesterday when we were terrified of being parents?,pam,9
35775,We were just kids.  What did we know?,jim,9
35777,Great.,jim,1
35778,Good.,pam,1
35780,Doesn't she sleep here?,pam,4
35782,I think we'll be okay.,jim,5
35784,"[as the baby yawns]  Oh, big yawn.",pam,8
35785,"Ready?  One, two, three...",jim,5
35786,"One, and then wrap around.  It's okay.  Hold that arm down.",pam,13
35787,"I can't.  She's too strong.  She's, careful, though.  You don't want to break it.",jim,17
35788,She's not gonna...  Just...,pam,5
35789,I got it.  Alright.,jim,5
35790,Go.,pam,1
35791,Nurse!,jim,1
35792,How you doing?,jim,3
35793,"I don't know.  I just, I can't tell if she's getting anything.",pam,13
35794,Really?,jim,1
35795,Doesn't feel right.,pam,3
35796,"Well, you're pushing the milk out, right?",jim,7
35797,How does one do that?,pam,5
35798,Wasn't it...  It's kinda like a...  Like that.,jim,10
35799,"Do you want to try it, Jim?",pam,7
35800,I think you're good.  Doing a good job.,jim,9
35802,"Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.",jim,10
35803,I can't tell if she's getting anything.  It just doesn't really feel right.,pam,14
35805,Even if she's not getting anything?,pam,6
35807,No.  I read in the book about nipple confusion.,pam,10
35809,"She's just, she's really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.",pam,17
35811,Alright.,jim,1
35813,It's going to be alright.,jim,5
35814,Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.,pam,14
35815,"Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.",jim,9
35817,"What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?",michael,16
35820,I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.,michael,9
35824,"Okay, hold on.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You got to let the cookies cool before you pop 'em in your mouth.  Why don't you guys get to know each other?  Maybe have lunch together?",michael,37
35827,Good!,michael,1
35830,"Sure.  Kevin, please leave.",michael,5
35832,Bye.,michael,1
35834,Okay.  This is going to kill Kevin.,michael,8
35836,"I'm not so sure.  Kevin has an enormous heart.  Literally, he has an elephant heart.  He had a transplant when he was seventeen.  Had some problems, blah blah blah.",michael,33
35838,"No, Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart.  But he is very sensitive.  And it won't kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him...  I bet his heart is enlarged, though.",michael,43
35840,Just don't let him sit on you...  I'm kidding.  You'll have fun.  It'll be good.  It'll be good.  There he is.  Go to him.,michael,30
35845,"Oh, hi.",jim,2
35848,"Careful...  Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.",jim,11
35849,I know.,pam,2
35850,You see that?  I'm pretty sure she's...  Hi.,jim,10
35857,Yes?,pam,1
35859,"Um, yeah, that would be great.",pam,6
35860,Yup.  Really great.  When's she available?,jim,8
35862,"So, uh, biggest thing, besides not being able to get her to latch...",pam,13
35864,"Oh, thank you.  Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing.  I don't know if she's getting anything.",pam,22
35866,Okay.,pam,1
35868,Okay.,pam,1
35870,"No, I mean, it feels...  pressure.",pam,7
35872,Are you sure it doesn't hurt?,jim,6
35873,No.  It just feels like pressure.,pam,7
35875,Yup.,jim,1
35877,Yeah.,jim,1
35879,Perfect.,jim,1
35881,I think she will.,jim,4
35882,"Okay.  So, I'm just not sure if I'm releasing, though.  I'm not sure if...",pam,16
35883,We'll figure it out.,jim,4
35885,"Okay.  Aw, thank you.",pam,5
35887,Thank you.,jim,2
35889,Okay.,pam,1
35890,Please do.,jim,2
35891,"Oh, shoot.",pam,2
35892,What?,jim,1
35893,"Shoot, she fell off.",pam,4
35894,"Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing.",jim,6
35895,"Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?",pam,9
35896,No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.,jim,13
35897,"Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it.",pam,14
35898,"Okay, I'll just go get the other guy.",jim,8
35899,"[on the phone]  Hey, what's up, kid?",dwight,8
35901,"Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts.  Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?",dwight,24
35903,Very well.,dwight,2
35905,"[trying to sleep as the baby cries]  Jim, Jim, get her.",pam,12
35906,Hmm?,jim,1
35907,Get the baby.  Get her.  Come on.,pam,9
35908,Okay.  Sshh.  I know.  [hands the baby to Pam],jim,12
35909,I got her.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay...  Jim!  She latched!  She latched.,pam,17
35910,That's amazing.,jim,2
35911,"Oh, my God.  I didn't even have to do the 'C thing.'",pam,13
35912,That's awesome.,jim,2
35913,"Aw, we're doing it.",pam,4
35914,that's great.,jim,2
35915,We're really parents now.,pam,4
35916,Mm-hmm.,jim,1
35917,Kevin.  Erin would like a few words with you.,michael,10
35930,"Oh, my God, this is agonizing.  Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?",michael,19
35932,"Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin.  And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place.",michael,30
35934,No.,michael,1
35936,Lynn was as hot as Erin.,michael,6
35938,"This isn't about me, and that is debatable.  And I have a personality, where as you...  Yes, Andy?",michael,20
35939,[he hits his head on the desk after ducking out of the way from hiding behind a plant]  Ow.,andy,20
35940,Kev...  Nice.  Going.,michael,5
35943,"Oh, hey, Isabelle.",pam,3
35944,Hey.,jim,1
35946,"Yes.  She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down.  Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her.  I don't want her to spit up on you.  Come here, sweety...  Oh, my God!  Wrong baby!",pam,45
35947,What?,jim,1
35948,Wrong baby!  This is not our baby!  Sshh.,pam,10
35949,"Okay, okay.",jim,2
35950,"Oh, my gosh.",pam,3
35952,"No, not at all.",pam,4
35953,Perfect.,jim,1
35956,"Well, I feel like she needs to eat, but she won't latch on, which is weird, because the other baby di...",pam,21
35957,Ha ha ha.,jim,3
35959,"We definitely are.  At 3:00, right?  You said we could stay until 3:00?",jim,15
35961,Half hour.,jim,2
35963,"Yes, car seat's right there.",jim,5
35965,"Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.",jim,10
35967,"Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be...  Can we get a late checkout?  I don't...  I don't think she heard me.",jim,30
35969,"Isabelle.  Hello...  Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so...",dwight,11
35971,Yup.,dwight,1
35973,"Oh, it's...  In the backyard.  I'll take this.",dwight,10
35975,"Hey, listen.  I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning.  You know, just for fun.",dwight,26
35977,"Are they now?  Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right?  Ha ha.",dwight,16
35979,"Alright.  I'll call you, kid.",dwight,6
35981,Are you really sure we should be leaving?,jim,8
35983,"But you hear the baby crying, right?",jim,7
35985,"Uh, it's in the lot.",jim,5
35987,"Right, okay.  Yes, that would be the smart thing to do.  Uh, Pam, I will be right back.",jim,20
35988,"Okay, please hurry.",pam,3
35989,"Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately.  It's really important, so I'm going to stand here and wait for the confirmation.",andy,25
35991,"The fax says 'Erin, will you have dinner with me?' from Andy, and the number is our office fax number.",andy,20
35993,"Sorry, that's unacceptable.  I need you to send it immediately, or you're fired.",andy,14
35995,"Oh, God, no.  I'm...  Just read the fax.",andy,10
35997,I'm...  I'm asking you out.,andy,6
35999,"So, it's a date.",andy,4

36008,"Oh, yeah, sorry.",pam,3
36010,"Okay, alright, thanks...  Okay, do you want to eat?  You want to try eating?  Okay...  Okay, let me...  Just you and me.  Come on.  There we go...  Yeah...  Oh, yeah.  Like that.  There we go.  You got it.",pam,50
36011,Five tickets on the windshield...  Hey.,jim,7
36012,Hi.  We did it.,pam,5
36013,"You used my move, didn't you?",jim,6
36014,I used a variation of your move.,pam,7
36015,"[smoking a cigar]  There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love.  And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today...  I think I'm going to be sick...",michael,50
36016,"Two forms of ID, please.",dwight,5
36018,Nothing.,dwight,1
36020,Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice.  I feel sick...  [Jim and Pam walk in to their house with the baby]  I couldn't find the iPod...  Give me a couple days.  I'll be out of your hair.,dwight,43
36021,Hello hello. Top of the morning to you!  Ooh ooh! Green M&Ms! Nature's Viagra! [Grabs and pours Kevin-esque scoop of M&Ms into his coat pocket] Two of my favorite joke areas combined. It'll be a good day.,michael,38

36045,Okay. Come on! Jim!,dwight,4
36046,"Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But ...

36048,Morning!,jim,1

36055,Yes it is!,michael,3
36057,"No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal.",michael,18

36064,Thanks. It's actually my sister's old field hockey skirt.,andy,9

36067,Great.,dwight,1

36080,Pretty amazing.,jim,2

36084,Is that what happened to you?,jim,6
36085,"I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.",dwight,33
36086,That's a common mistake.,jim,4
36087,"Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending.",dwight,12

36129,"All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.",michael,11
36130,Let's follow the chain of events. Jo likes Michael. Jo invites Michael to house. Jo doesn't like Michael anymore. Hmmm.,michael,20

36172,She should go home. It's not the end of the world. We'll go on our date next week. She's still gonna like me in a week. Right?,andy,27
36174,I was just working at my desk and I wanted to run some new leads by you. [Turns feint],andy,19
36176,"No, no, no, no, no.",andy,5
36178,I have some good ideas...,andy,5
36180,You sure?,andy,2
36182,Very nice.,michael,2
36184,"A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo's eye. How'd you make that happen?",michael,22
36186,"Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?",michael,8
36188,"How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?",michael,19
36190,Okay. All right.,michael,3
36192,Hey there. So I think I'm done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier.,michael,20

36196,Right. What?,michael,2
36198,Mm. mm. Oh well.,michael,4

36210,Yeah. Maybe next year.,michael,4
36213,Hi!,andy,1
36215,"That's okay, I'm in my 'worky-works.' You look amazing!",andy,9
36222,"Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. [Jim is silent] No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working. [Whistles 'Cat's in the Cradle' song]",dwight,52
36223,"Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening [phone rings] I have...",dwight,13
36225,"Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.",jim,41
36227,"You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!",jim,14
36229,Okay.,jim,1
36231,"Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week.",dwight,19

36252,"Are we rotating seats, or?",andy,5
36256,"So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-?",andy,16
36258,All right. Formative years. [She laughs],andy,6
36260,"Yeah, it's a kilt.",andy,4
36264,How late do we have to work tonight?,michael,8
36266,Why does she do that? Why doesn't she just tell you what your schedule is?,michael,15
36268,"Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would've turned thirty. That's just - that's just depressing.",michael,38
36269,Hello Jo.,michael,2
36271,"There is, as a matter of fact. It's getting sorta late. It's 8:30. And it's St. Patrick's Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I'm going to dismiss my employees.",michael,34
36273,"I'm thrilled with the work they've done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around.",michael,22

36286,Drinks are on me!,michael,4
36288,Oh -hoh! All right.,michael,4
36291,"Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever. [Meredith joins behind Packer] What the hell is going on back there?",michael,19
36292,Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. [Reveal Jim behind Quad-Desk] Thank you.,jim,23
36293,What the hell is this?,dwight,5
36294,Oh!,jim,1
36295,This is not Mega-Desk.,dwight,4
36296,"No, it's not. They call it Quad-Desk.",jim,7
36297,"That's ridiculous, this is made up of three desks.",dwight,9
36298,Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we? [Dwight's phone rings. He crawls into nook under Jim's Quad-Desk],jim,23
36299,"Hello, Dwight Schrute?",dwight,3
36300,"Hey Jim, Jim. Come here. [holds up photo] Do you know who that is?",michael,14

36305,Where did you take that?,jim,5
36306,In my condo complex.,michael,4
36307,"Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.",jim,20
36308,"I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie.",michael,16
36309,Sure. That they should do one.,jim,6
36310,"[feigning accent] Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl?",michael,14
36311,Who's that?,jim,2
36312,"Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.",michael,7
36313,John Dillinger.,jim,2
36314,No. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.,michael,5
36315,Captain Crunch.,jim,2
36316,"Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it's not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you'd seen Roger Clemens?",michael,25
36317,At the Yankees game. Yeah.,jim,5
36318,"Yeah. Well, it wasn't him.",michael,5
36319,"I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp...",jim,20
36320,"I know, I know.",michael,4
36321,...in your condo complex.,jim,4
36322,I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.,michael,14
36323,M. Night Shulman?,jim,3
36324,"[speaking at a staff meeting] First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don't have a pet, please don't feel like -",michael,43
36326,"Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?",dwight,11
36327,"Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet. But will be.. [muttering, people rise to leave] No, no, meeting's not over.",michael,35
36329,No sales topic per se.,michael,5

36331,Dwight?,michael,1
36332,"Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make.",dwight,7
36333,"I would like your undivided attention, please.",michael,7

36336,"Listen, Michael - about what happened earlier.",dwight,7
36337,Yeah.,michael,1
36338,When I was asking about the leads.,dwight,7
36339,M-hmm.,michael,1
36340,... is there any news on the leads?,dwight,8
36341,Is that all you have to say to me?,michael,9
36342,"Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! [leaves office] Alright, Dwight out!",dwight,52
36343,"Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?",dwight,33
36346,"Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It's a big cheque. [Jim stands in corner, texting]",michael,13
36347,"Oh, sorry, wait one second.",jim,5

36349,"This is actually a big potential sale, so...",jim,8
36350,You writing your memoirs over there?,michael,6
36351,You writing your name over there?,jim,6
36352,"Well, it's a pretty big check.",michael,6
36353,"That's good. You know, with the kid.",jim,7
36354,Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people.,michael,13
36355,"Alright, here we go. [taps page] Michael...",jim,7
36356,"I'm just saying, that -",michael,5
36357,Michael - [Michael signs] Great.,jim,5

36365,You saw who did this and you didn't stop them?,michael,10
36367,The sales department smashed my sandwich.,michael,6

36371,That's what she said.,michael,4
36373,Yeah.,michael,1
36375,Thank you very much.,michael,4

36377,"Ah, just the stupid leads.",michael,5
36378,Alright!,jim,1
36380,Me likey!,andy,2
36385,"Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.",michael,48
36387,They act like I have no power.,michael,7
36391,"Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that.",michael,16
36393,Exactly that.,michael,2
36395,Exactly that.,michael,2
36397,"Hello. May I have everyone's attention, please? Gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads, so I'm going to give the leads to... King Creed! [hands him a lead]",michael,30
36399,- and to King Meredith! [hands her a lead],michael,9
36401,And to King Angela! [hands her a lead] Because today we are all kings. And queens [pats Oscar's shoulder].,michael,19
36403,"I'm giving them the leads, Phyllis.",michael,6
36404,Hey.,jim,1
36405,Hey.,michael,1
36406,"So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?",jim,27
36407,Mm-hmm.,michael,1
36408,"Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls?",jim,19
36409,Okay. [passes Jim some index cards],michael,6
36410,"Hey, alright.",jim,2
36411,Alright.,michael,1
36412,"Ahh, these aren't leads. What are they?",jim,7
36414,I don't think you understand -,jim,6
36415,I do understand it.,michael,4
36416,[holds up card] This one's a map.,jim,7
36417,Or is it?,michael,3
36429,"[over phone] Hey baby, what's up?",pam,6
36430,I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?,jim,25
36431,Nothing but vomit and diapers over here.,pam,7
36432,"Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more.",jim,8
36433,Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies [holds up index cards] - that's just unfair.,jim,22

36435,"He means his mopey place, it's under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca.",pam,15
36436,I love you.,jim,3
36438,Hey. I guess you probably won't give me your leads since I'm a jerk salesman.,andy,15
36440,Where?,andy,1
36442,Are you...,andy,2
36444,Are you sure?,andy,3
36446,"What are you doing, idiot? [Jim is crouched down, peering under a car]",dwight,13
36447,Michael's stupid scavenger hunt.,jim,4

36453,"Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.",dwight,13
36454,"Well, bigshot, 'If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'.",michael,16

36475,"Okay. You know what, let's just go to the dump, start looking - Ryan, c'mon, shotgun in my car -",michael,20
36477,"Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, 'Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they're now in the city dump.'",michael,40
36479,"Well, that's not the way it's going t sound. Here's what we're going to do. We'll go to the dump, we'll look around, then we'll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you -",michael,48
36481,Really?,michael,1
36483,"Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit [looks to Jim for vocab-reassurance] Complicit. You were all successories!",michael,18
36485,You can.,michael,2
36487,"Okay fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself.",michael,10
36488,"I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up.",dwight,8
36489,[looks around dump] This place has gone to hell.,dwight,9
36490,"You know, Dwight, there was a time when you'd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.",michael,23
36491,"Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak.",dwight,7
36492,"Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you don't believe me, look in my gutters.",michael,17
36494,Phew! Can't wait for this day to be over.,jim,9
36496,Just all the - drama.,jim,5
36498,"Between the - us and you guys. It's unnecessary, right?",jim,10
36500,"Oh, good, phew,  thank god you said that.",jim,9
36502,I have new baby pictures.,jim,5
36504,"She's wearing a onesie [holds out his cell phone, Oscar leans in but Kelly grabs his arm]",jim,17
36506,Didn't we kind of start it?,jim,6
36508,Yeah.,andy,1
36510,"Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?",jim,17
36511,"All those who agree, say aye [all present - Stanley, Andy and Phyllis -  raise their hands] All those opposed -",andy,22
36512,I don't think we need opposed.,jim,6
36513,"[kicking through rubbish at the dump] You've changed, man.",michael,9
36514,"Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?",dwight,11
36515,"Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.",michael,17
36516,Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.,dwight,11
36517,"No, I'm talking about your personality, Dwight.",michael,7
36518,"When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I'd assistant managed him -",dwight,30

36520,"Oh, that's low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!",dwight,13
36521,Yeah.,michael,1

36523,You think you would have done better without me? Really?,michael,10
36524,I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.,dwight,10
36525,Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldn't have been hanging out watching karate movies with you -,michael,28
36526,Kung-fu movies!,dwight,2
36527,"You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies -",michael,24
36528,Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars.,dwight,10
36529,"That's my wife you're talking about, man.",michael,7

36532,Don't do it [lobs something at Michael],dwight,7
36533,"No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight. [they throw volleys of rubbish at each other] No, time out, time out. [Michael inspects a box, then hurls it at Dwight] Time in!",michael,36
36534,No! [lunges for a large wooden spool],dwight,7
36535,"Don't even think about that [Dwight begins rolling it towards Michael, as he reaches him Dwight kicks it and falls backward. The spool comes to a halt in front of Michael, and Michael pushes it towards Dwight.]",michael,37

36539,And I'll text Erin. She's really good at this stuff too.,andy,11
36542,Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.,jim,10
36544,"Alright. Then we're back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I'm for it.",jim,29
36546,Erin just texted me back. 'People love shells from far-away beaches'.,andy,11
36547,"Okay, Dwight. Here we go [picks up a sink, spills dump juice on his pants] oh god.",michael,17

36717,Usually means there's a battle scene coming.,dwight,7
36718,"So, what do you do?",michael,5
36720,Really?,michael,1
36722,"See, I didn't think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now?",michael,23
36724,Yes. I feel like an idiot. Awesome.,michael,7

37036,Mm-hmm. You didn't know that? Oh.,michael,6
37038,Okay.,michael,1
37041,I don't know. Probably didn't want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else.,michael,19

37120,"What? What do you mean, suspend me?",pam,7
37121,I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.,jim,16
37123,"Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.",dwight,9
37126,Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary's Day?,andy,11
37127,"Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.",michael,45
37128,"I was going to tell her, just on my own time.",andy,11
37129,"You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret.",michael,24
37130,"Who cares? I mean it's not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it... I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things.",andy,42
37139,Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.,pam,8
37141,Yeah. And he worked here too.,pam,6
37143,"No, no it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants.",pam,38
37145,Thank you. [kisses Jim on the cheek],pam,7
37147,[answers phone] Hey Toby.,pam,4
37149,Very interesting.,pam,2
37151,[Gabe walks in] Thanks Toby.,pam,5
37153,I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.,pam,24
37154,"And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.",jim,27
37155,"[gets up and walks towards Gabe] Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. [Jim and Pam get their things together and start to leave] Gabriel, I apologize.",dwight,26

37185,"No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?",michael,16
37187,Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel... I'm sorry I caused that thing.,michael,14
37191,You said butt.,michael,3
37193,"Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him: 'Hey! Hey Scott!'",michael,24
37194,"Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary's Day.",andy,16
37198,"Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.",jim,10
37199,Yeah. 'I vant to count to ten'.,pam,7
37203,That would have been funny.,pam,5

37210,"I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of North America. And... I am going on vacation next week to Cancun.",michael,47
37211,"Buenos dias, Jaime.",michael,3
37212,"Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?",jim,14
37213,"Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!",michael,5
37214,"Guten tag, Herr Michael.",dwight,4
37215,"I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.",dwight,31
37216,La telefona.,michael,2
37220,"[clears throat] Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!",michael,9
37222,"Damn it. [knock on door] Ah, Angelo.",michael,7
37224,Yo soy Cancun.,michael,3
37226,"All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.",jim,16
37227,"You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like, [vaudeville delivery] 'I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee.'",pam,26
37228,"Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.",jim,8
37229,Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.,michael,10
37230,"You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.",dwight,18
37231,I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.,michael,15
37232,"If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?",dwight,29
37233,[whispers] That's a good point.,jim,5
37234,This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together.,pam,15
37235,Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.,jim,11
37236,"We have good give and take. [vaudeville delivery] I give, he takes.",pam,12
37237,[whispering] I don't even know who you are anymore.,jim,9
37238,[vaudeville delivery] Yee.,pam,3
37240,"Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, I'm Jim.",jim,7
37242,How are you?,jim,3
37243,Did somebody order a hooker over here?,michael,7
37245,Hi. How are you?,michael,4
37246,"There's this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexter's and, right now, we're in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so...",michael,45
37247,"Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today.",michael,17
37249,"Oh, no we're actually married. We're not brother and sister.",pam,10
37251,All right.,jim,2
37254,"[explaining PowerPoint to Donna] So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate [knocking] So it's a tradeoff.",jim,22
37255,[barges in] Hi.,michael,3
37256,Hold on one second.,jim,4
37257,"Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret?",michael,16
37258,What?,jim,1
37259,Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.,michael,24
37260,None of this is time sensitive.,jim,6
37261,"Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.",michael,10
37263,"Okay, I have more of them.",michael,6
37266,What is this?,dwight,3
37268,"It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.",dwight,8
37270,How do I apply?,dwight,4
37272,"Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?",dwight,21
37274,Come here. Come here.,dwight,4
37276,"Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?",dwight,25
37279,"One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?",dwight,40
37281,"Oh, man. White people, right?",dwight,5
37283,"Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.",dwight,8
37285,"I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.",dwight,16
37287,I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.,dwight,12
37289,"I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of?",dwight,16
37291,You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.,dwight,14
37293,That's not... she's... okay. Yes.,dwight,5
37294,"I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you... there we go! [Michael's picture pops up on the PowerPoint screen] Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white.",michael,53
37296,"And that would be a display [image from a catalog of a man wearing only white boxers pops up] of the crisp, gorgeous black.",michael,24
37298,"It's subtle. That's how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. 	And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn't know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she's turned on.",michael,48
37299,This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I've never taken anybody there before.,michael,21
37301,Ryan.,michael,1
37303,And that's it. That's me. That's who I am.,michael,9
37305,"Oh, thanks. [softly] You're not bad, either.",michael,7
37307,Hmm.,michael,1
37309,Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?,michael,17
37310,"[in his office] You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?",michael,25
37311,No.,jim,1
37312,I'll have one.,pam,3
37313,"Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work.",jim,10
37314,"Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.",michael,23
37315,"Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant.",jim,6
37316,"Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here.",pam,18
37318,"Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.",michael,27
37319,What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?,pam,12
37320,What?,jim,1
37321,What was that?,jim,3
37322,Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.,pam,14
37323,"Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale.",jim,14
37324,Who cares? [Michael peeking at them through his office window] It's not that huge a sale.,pam,16
37325,"Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.",jim,16
37326,"Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. [pat's Jim's arm] Good luck, wingman. [salutes]",pam,16
37327,How as being a minority affected you?,dwight,7
37329,"Oh, good, and you resent this because...",dwight,7
37331,"Oh, no, no. That's not dorky. [Dwight wears his phone like that] Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house.",dwight,29
37338,Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.,pam,12
37341,"Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility.",jim,13
37343,Yeah. [chuckles],jim,2
37344,"So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?",michael,10
37345,What's that?,jim,2
37346,Maybe wee find some wiggle room?,michael,6
37347,I don't... I don't think so.,jim,6
37348,I think we could. [Donna giggles],michael,6
37350,"Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.",michael,16
37352,Why don't you run them again?,michael,6
37353,What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?,jim,12
37354,"If she is, it's working.",michael,5
37356,She does not like him.,jim,5
37357,You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?,pam,23
37358,cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.,jim,11
37359,I was after your money.,pam,5
37360,"Well, the joke was on you.",jim,6
37361,"Yes, it was.",pam,3
37364,Hey... what are you guys doing?,dwight,6
37368,"You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.",dwight,10
37370,Ryan? What does he know?,dwight,5
37373,We?',dwight,1
37376,"Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.",dwight,43
37377,So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller...,michael,12
37379,Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. [Donna laughing] Just kidding. Do you like mints?,michael,16
37381,I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?,michael,10
37383,They're good [Donna grabs mint],michael,5
37385,Sure.,michael,1
37387,I can't stop myself from kissing her.,michael,7
37389,"Well, why don't you just move the M&M's?",andy,8
37391,"Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time.",michael,16
37392,It is totally insane.,jim,4
37394,Okay. What do you think?,michael,5
37396,Andy?,michael,1
37397,Ehh.,andy,1
37398,"Okay, some for, some against.",michael,5
37399,Nobody's for.,jim,2
37400,Pam?,michael,1
37401,Hmm?,pam,1
37403,"Um... I think it's really, really unlikely.",pam,7
37404,Okay.,jim,1
37405,Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible.,pam,9
37406,What?,jim,1
37407,"I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.",pam,27
37408,I'm going with Pam's group.,michael,5
37409,Wait.,jim,1
37410,Here we go.,michael,3
37411,Michael. Michael.,jim,2
37412,Okay.,michael,1
37413,Michael.,jim,1
37414,"No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just... thank you for talking. Wish me luck.",michael,13
37415,No.,jim,1
37416,"What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point.",michael,48
37417,Kelly is disqualified!,dwight,3
37419,"You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America.",dwight,30
37421,"Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic.",dwight,15
37424,Kelly is the only applicant.,dwight,5
37427,"Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back.",dwight,15
37433,We should have your contract done by Thursday.,michael,8
37435,Okay.,michael,1
37437,"Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.",michael,10
37439,I don't know. I think so.,michael,6
37441,"[whispers] Okay. So... Oh, Donna?",michael,5
37444,Thank you so much.,michael,4
37446,Mmm. [Donna giggles],michael,3
37448,"[follows her out of office] Ahem. So, um... okay, if you have... if there's any other questions that you have...",michael,20
37450,All right. All right. Bye.,michael,5
37452,And have a good elevator ride.,michael,6
37454,"Oh, what's that out there?",michael,5
37456,How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?,dwight,25
37458,"I wasn't talking to you, pale-face.",dwight,6
37460,What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.,dwight,14
37462,Yes.,dwight,1
37465,"Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective.",dwight,22
37467,I can protect you from Kelly. [Erin stifles laugh] Will you get out of here? Seriously. [Erin turns and leaves kitchen],dwight,21
37469,"Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program 'print in all colors' initiative.",dwight,27
37471,Helping heal America in a dramatic fashion in the 11th hour.,dwight,11
37473,"Caucasians, am I right? [to Hide] Have a seat. I'll translate.",dwight,11
37475,You don't know what you need. Just...,dwight,7
37478,"Hey, Michael. [Michael is sitting on couch outside his office] How you doing?",pam,13
37479,I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore.,michael,12
37480,"You know what, Michael? For what it's worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.",pam,19
37481,She suckered you too.,michael,4
37482,Mm-hmm.,pam,1
37483,Was it the cleavage?,michael,4
37484,"Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts.",pam,5
37485,Yep.,michael,1
37487,"You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh... I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, and thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO. You know, she's touching around down there. It's easy to get confused.",andy,53
37489,God. She left this here?,michael,5
37491,Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.,michael,13
37492,What?,jim,1
37494,Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off.,michael,12
37496,Michael...,pam,1
37497,[hold up barrette] Well...,michael,4
37498,She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you.,pam,13
37499,"Yeah, I know. I know.",michael,5
37500,I'm sorry.,pam,2
37501,"I know. You're right. Thank you. Thanks everybody. [waves, returns to his office, clears throat, turns around and runs out of office]",michael,22
37502,Michael! [sighs],pam,2
37503,"[runs down to parking lot, sighs]",michael,6
37505,Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette.,michael,8
37512,"Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it. [Dwight extends his hand, but Kelly hugs him]",dwight,17
37514,Oh.,dwight,1
37516,Gosh. He he.,dwight,3
37518,"Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?",dwight,21
37519,You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So... there's your barrette.,michael,24
37521,Who?,michael,1
37523,About what?,michael,2
37525,"No, no. No.",michael,3
37527,No... [they kiss again],michael,4
37528,[returns to office] What happened?,michael,5
37530,"Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it! [all look at him] I kissed. We kissed.",michael,19
37533,"No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette [holds up barrette] We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did.",michael,32
37534,You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. [shouts] I did do it!,michael,22
37535,Stop it!,dwight,2
37536,Stop what?,jim,2
37537,"You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!",dwight,20
37538,"[chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.",jim,54
37539,Yup. That's exactly what we did.,jim,6
37540,"It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, 'I will when you lose the baby weight.'",pam,31
37541,Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. [Pam clacking her stapler and Jim responding with tapping his keyboard rhythmically] Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!,dwight,25
37542,Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?,michael,6
37543,It's a pen.,jim,3
37544,"Michael, come on.",dwight,3
37545,"Get back to work, Dwight. Please.",michael,6
37546,Fine. [clears throat] Hey. Tap away. [Dwight puts noise-cancelling headphones on and Pam and Jim begin to blink rhythmically],dwight,19
37547,"Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh... we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!",michael,45
37550,Okay.,michael,1
37552,"Okay, you get out of here, big dog. [high-fives Stanley] Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.",michael,22
37553,Stanley got to go.,pam,4
37554,"Yeah, well, Stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out.",michael,15
37555,Walk around apple orchards.,andy,4
37556,Oh!,michael,1
37557,Super romantic.,andy,2
37558,That's fun.,michael,2
37559,Eel fishing.,dwight,2
37560,All right.,michael,2
37563,"We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang's.",michael,22
37565,"Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, 'I wanna go to Mount Pocono,' you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.",michael,26
37567,"You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World: Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see.",michael,43
37569,You guys think Donna's cheating on me?,michael,7
37570,"No, Michael, no.",pam,3
37571,Are you nuts?,dwight,3
37572,You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...,pam,12
37573,"... and... we had sex, too.",michael,6
37574,That is right. Don't make any more of it.,pam,9
37575,How?,michael,1
37576,How what?,pam,2
37577,How do I not make any more of it?,michael,9
37578,You could start by concluding this meeting.,pam,7
37579,"All right.  [all stand up to leave] And she won't say, 'I love you.'",michael,15
37580,"Oh, no.",dwight,2
37581,How many dates have you been on?,andy,7
37582,Nine dates. I said it on the second date.,michael,9
37583,Mm.,andy,1
37587,"Yeah, she does all that.",michael,5
37589,"No, no...",michael,2
37590,"Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.",pam,8
37591,Run what?,michael,2
37592,"Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control.",pam,11
37593,"Why didn't you just say that, Pam?",michael,7
37594,"Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.",pam,10
37595,"Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world.",michael,20
37596,You do?,jim,2
37597,"Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.",michael,18
37598,But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.,jim,12
37599,That's what makes it so wrong.,michael,6
37600,"Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me.",michael,25
37601,"Oh, God, that tickles. What did...",dwight,6
37602,[whispers] I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.,michael,20
37603,I think I've got one for you. [hands Michael a business card],dwight,12
37604,This is you. How much do you charge?,michael,8
37605,"$100 a day, plus expenses.",dwight,5
37606,I'll give you $50. Money's no object.,michael,7
37607,I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find.,dwight,20
37608,Okay.,michael,1
37609,"And you might not like how I find it. [slides over table, leaves]",dwight,13
37610,"Of course. Yeah, that's terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire.",andy,32
37612,"Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It's really important.",andy,13
37614,"Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire.",andy,36
37616,What are we gonna do about this?,andy,7
37618,Let me know what they say.,andy,6
37620,What do you mean?,andy,4
37622,I don't know.,andy,3
37625,[sitting on his Firebird's hood in front of a gym] Hi stranger.,dwight,12
37627,I work with Michael.,dwight,4
37629,Dwight Schrute. [they shake hands],dwight,5
37631,"All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.",dwight,35
37632,"That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?",jim,13
37633,"It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.",michael,22
37634,Oh!...,pam,1
37635,"Oh, my God",jim,3
37636,"It's comfort food, all right? [disgustedly] God.",michael,7
37637,"You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up.",jim,17
37638,"I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what Dwight says.",michael,12
37639,Why do we have to see what Dwight says?,pam,9
37640,Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update.,michael,12
37641,"Michael, no...",jim,2
37642,"No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.",pam,8
37643,It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.,michael,20
37644,"Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.",pam,19
37645,"God, this is so disgusting.",michael,5
37646,Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.,pam,19
37647,I know.,michael,2
37648,And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in.,pam,10
37649,"That's not true. [Pam stares him down] You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.",michael,21
37650,Helene.,pam,1
37651,Helene?,michael,1
37652,My mother.,pam,2
37653,Oh.,michael,1
37654,"My mother, Helene. [Jim shakes his head]",pam,7
37655,"Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.",michael,15
37656,"You should stop this, [pulls away mayo and olives bowl] and you should call Dwight right now.",jim,17
37657,[sighs] All right. [calls Dwight],michael,5
37658,"[at gym, looks ready to work out, checks phone, and tries to grab Donna's attention] Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead.",dwight,32
37660,"It's all yours. [strains loudly to lift two dumbbells and a free weight chained to strap around his head] Ah! [after first rep, Dwight is injured]",dwight,26
37662,"Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?",dwight,16
37664,Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.,dwight,9
37665,[moaning loudly on exercise machine while staring at Donna who's next to him] Oh. Oh. Oh. [groans loudly] One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. [chuckles] You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?,dwight,48
37667,"Really? Hey, um... [Dwight gets up and walks sorely from his 'workout']",dwight,12
37669,Get out of my way. Huh!,dwight,6
37670,"Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right?",dwight,5
37672,"Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm here: to see... you... naked... while... I'm... naked.",dwight,21
37674,"Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh! [Dwight is very sore from his 'workout' and cannot chase Donna]",dwight,16
37675,You're back. What happened?,michael,4
37676,"Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.",dwight,11
37677,"No, what happened with Donna?",michael,5
37678,"Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. [near his groin]",dwight,20
37679,Ugh!,michael,1
37680,Put your fingers here.,dwight,4
37681,No. No! Are you sure?,michael,5
37682,"I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there.",dwight,11
37683,Who eats eight protein bars?,michael,5
37684,People who don't trust egg whites.,dwight,6
37685,"Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.",michael,10
37686,"Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious.",dwight,21
37687,"What? No, she didn't say that.",michael,6
37689,I am not paying for that membership.,michael,7
37690,"[sitting on the floor behind Erin's desk, sighs] Ohhh... mmm...",michael,10
37692,"No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?",michael,9
37694,That's her?,michael,2
37696,"Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. [Michael pretends to be speaking on the phone as Donna approaches] Okay, I'll talk to you later.",michael,21
37698,I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.,michael,17
37700,"Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.",michael,37
37702,"If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.",michael,9
37704,"Well, you are boner-ific. [Donna laughs]",michael,6
37706,...poop my pants.,michael,3
37708,"Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?",michael,11
37710,We are?,michael,2
37712,What's up? I got your e-mail.,andy,6
37714,Okay.,andy,1
37717,Such as?,andy,2
37719,What? You don't know what it meant? How about 'Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?',andy,18
37721,[chuckles nervously] Yeah. Hah. Hoo.,andy,5
37732,[to Pam] What?,jim,3
37733,Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing.,pam,5
37734,"Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael.",pam,24
37735,"Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?",jim,10
37736,No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.,pam,12
37738,Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this.,andy,13
37742,Wow. [Pam knocks on Michaels door and goes in] That's exciting.,michael,11
37743,"Hey, Michael.",pam,2
37744,Hey.,michael,1
37745,"I'm sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.",pam,19
37746,Well it can wait. It can wait.,michael,7
37747,I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to.,pam,20
37748,Jim is her husband.,michael,4
37750,And...,pam,1
37751,"And they are having problems, so sh...",michael,7
37752,"No, not... we're not... we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love...",pam,16
37753,Good in bed.,michael,3
37754,"Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim.",pam,15
37755,"Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?",michael,20
37756,[loudly] I need you to sign this! So bad!,pam,9
37757,"Okay, weirdo.",michael,2
37758,I love [leans over Michael's desk to look at his computer screen]... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely. [meanwhile Michael looks at the pictures Pam printed out],pam,31
37760,"[to Michael] You're gonna wanna look at the date on that.  Oh, wow. Look at... golfing. [to Donna] Are you a golfer?",pam,23
37762,"Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?",michael,13
37763,Absolutely. [both leave Michael's office],pam,5
37766,Your text said 911.,andy,4
37769,What's bad?,andy,2
37772,"Oh, God.",andy,2
37774,"I might have to go public here, but no one's gonna believe me. Uh... I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire.",andy,26
37776,Yeah.,andy,1
37778,There what is?,andy,3
37780,Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?,michael,9
37781,I don't know who he is.,pam,6
37782,God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?,michael,15
37783,What?,pam,1
37784,"I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to kill him.",michael,17
37785,You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.,pam,14
37786,I have to hear it from her.,michael,7
37787,You have to settle down first.,pam,6
37788,I need to have her tell me herself. Right?,michael,9
37789,Okay. Okay. Yes.,pam,3
37790,I need to have her say...,michael,6
37791,"Yeah, but you have to calm...",pam,6
37792,"I need to say, 'What the hell is that? What the hell is that?'",michael,14
37793,"Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.",pam,9
37794,"No, God! No, no, oh, my God!",michael,7
37795,"[in baby voice] Hi, Michael, hi, Michael",pam,7
37796,[calms down] Okay. Okay. Okay.,michael,5
37798,You know what? We should really do something fun this week.,michael,11
37800,Wouldn't that be fun?,michael,4
37802,How about Thursday?,michael,3
37804,I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?,michael,9
37806,"Oh, really? 'cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It'd be a great, great concert.",michael,27
37808,"Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by.",michael,8
37810,"Nope, that's Tuesday.",michael,3
37812,You're cheating. You're cheating on me.,michael,6
37814,"Pam told me. [looks up at 2nd floor windows and so does Donna; Jim, Dwight, and Pam are visible on conference room window, they all scramble as soon as Donna and Michael look up, Pam throwing herself on the floor]",michael,40
37815,[gasps] Did she see me?,pam,5
37816,[to Pam on floor] Nice effort.,jim,6
37817,"[in old Michael Scott Paper Company's 'office'] We're printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress. [Darryl is filming Andy's demonstration]",andy,29
37819,"Right. My name is Andrew Baines Bernard, and if you're watching this, it's because I've turned State's witness because I'm in danger because I know too much.",andy,27
37821,Higher? Okay. [speaking slightly higher] Recently certain events have come to my attention...,andy,13
37823,Make it higher? Okay.,andy,4
37825,[high-pitched] I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation...,andy,11
37827,[higher] May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger... [printer starts smoking and explodes] ah! [speaking lower] It's working. [in normal voice] It's... I knew it!,andy,27
37829,"We are blowin' the roof off! Blowin' the roof off! [Darryl discharges fire extinguisher onto printer] Nice. Nice. This is my partner, Darryl Philbin. He's been my partner through this entire thing.",andy,32
37831,Who is he?,michael,3
37833,The other man. Who's the guy? Who is it?,michael,9
37835,I'm the mistress?,michael,3
37836,"[on workout bicycle at gym] Okay, everybody, let's take this next hill.",dwight,12
37838,"You know what? You had your chance. You're no leader. Out of your seat, let's blast!",dwight,16
37840,No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side.,dwight,14
37842,"If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No! [points to those around him] You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. Good jump. You're barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate.",dwight,42
37845,Pfffffttt.,michael,1
37847,"You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?",michael,27
37849,"You know what? We're not gonna die of radon, we're gonna die of boredom.",michael,14
37851,"Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.",michael,27
37853,That's... not okay.,jim,3
37854,"Okay, alright.",michael,2
37855,"You were being really funny, and then you went too far.",dwight,11
37856,I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.,michael,8
37857,"No, hmmm... that's still...",dwight,4
37859,"Okay geniuses, how would you do it?",michael,7
37863,I don't know.,michael,3

37874,Good work. [clapping],michael,3
37875,What flavors did you get? [yawns],pam,6
37877,[reading flavors] Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?,pam,9
37879,"No, no, no, it's fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open 'em up.",pam,17
37881,"Yeah, and when Michael gets a broken heart, this whole place comes to a halt, so we're just trying to get out in front of this.",pam,26
37883,"[yawns] Yeah, or no... well... I don't know. I'm sorry. I was up all night with Cece, otherwise I'd be running this.",pam,22
37886,"And we need bodies in both these rooms, people. So please sign up.",pam,13
37888,"Oh, okay. Everyone, remember, when he get's like this, he will wallow, if you empathize. Keep conversations light and if you get stuck, and you don't know what to do, make a random sound effect okay? Farting noise, whatever. Okay.",pam,40
37890,"No, out! Get out now! Leave now.",pam,7
37891,"Leave, get outta here.",dwight,4
37892,Leave!,pam,1
37893,Right now!,dwight,2
37894,"Oh, and if he makes a joke, just laugh it up, no matter what. Okay?",pam,15
37895,[walks in] Morning everyone.,michael,4
37898,Hello!,michael,1
37899,"Michael, nice tie or something.",dwight,5
37900,"Oh, thank you. It's reversible, I think. [everyone laughs]",michael,9
37902,That's awesome. You want some ice cream?,pam,7
37903,"Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles' flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That's my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?",michael,29
37905,Okay. Well... that's random. I will dig into those later.,michael,10
37910,No.,dwight,1
37912,Alleged contract.,dwight,2
37914,"Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah! [pretends to karate chop her neck] See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it.",dwight,28
37915,"So much of this is just impossible to verify. Item five, point 'B', uh... the beet juice cleanse?",dwight,18
37917,How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.,dwight,12
37919,Eughh. [looks disgusted],dwight,3
37920,No secret crying. Hasn't even opened the tissue box in there.,andy,11
37921,Could he still be seeing her?,pam,6
37923,So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?,jim,13
37924,"Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big.",andy,8
37925,Exactly. It happened in Big.,jim,5
37926,"No, I gotta go. Text me later.",michael,7
37927,I'm really too tired to do this.,jim,7
37928,Me too!,pam,2
37929,Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?,jim,14
37930,Hey Michael.,pam,2
37931,Hey.,michael,1
37932,"We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.",pam,21
37933,We can order in from Hooters.,jim,6
37934,"Oh, Hooters to go. Nice.",michael,5
37935,We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.,pam,9
37936,Billy Joel Rock Band.,jim,4
37937,That... exists?,michael,2
37938,Yes.,pam,1
37939,"Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.",michael,14
37940,"[shouts] Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?",pam,8
37941,"Okay, Pam... she's not invisible so stop asking silly questions.",michael,10
37943,Since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?,michael,14
37944,"I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, it's wrong.",michael,31
37946,"Well, I think we all know what you're capable of Meredith.",michael,11
37949,"People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.",michael,31
37952,"I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.",michael,29
37953,How does he feel about it?,andy,6
37954,He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. [points to Andy] It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.,michael,47
37955,Now you're just being hurtful.,jim,5
37956,"I'm sorry, it... why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat...",michael,16
37958,On her diet! He's a sports guy. He's scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.,michael,13
37959,Did Donna tell you that?,andy,5
37960,Real sports with Bryant Gumble.,michael,5
37961,So you're just making a giant assumption. You don't even know the guy.,andy,13
37962,You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.,michael,30
37963,"My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I've lived the part. And let me tell you, I'd so much rather play the part on stage.",andy,47
37964,So... here's the thing about infidelity.,andy,6
37965,"Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.",michael,25
37966,How does that work?,andy,4
37967,Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.,michael,42
37968,"In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You're Ali Larter, I'm Beyonce.",andy,17
37969,I am Beyonce always.,michael,4
37970,Not this time.,andy,3
37971,"Yes, I am.",michael,3
37972,"This guy's a high school baseball coach, right? Let's go check him out, see what a horrible person he is.",andy,20
37973,I would love that.,michael,4
37974,Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let's go check it out.,andy,14
37975,I have work to do.,michael,5
37976,"Oh, really? I thought you were the boss.",andy,8
37977,Let's go. [starts walking towards the elevator] I can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her.,michael,37
37978,[humming Call to Post] Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum,andy,16
37979,"All right, Andy, please.",michael,4
37980,Baseball!,andy,1
37981,"Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him.",michael,11
37982,Where?,andy,1
37983,Right there. The coach!,michael,4
37984,Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!,andy,11
37985,"Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base?",michael,14
37986,"[announcer's voice] And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain.",andy,19
37987,"All right. Can you just-- can you just act normal for a second, please?",michael,14
37988,Whatever. I'm the one blending in.,andy,6
37990,Pam.,jim,1
37991,"Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe.",pam,5
37993,You were supposed to be the Lookout.,pam,7
37994,"Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag.",jim,12
37996,Sorry about that.,jim,3
37997,So embarrassing.,pam,2
37999,"Well, you were surprisingly restrained.",jim,5
38000,We will be well-rested tomorrow.,pam,5
38002,Excellent. Go for it.,jim,4
38004,"Right? So, uh, let's uh...",jim,5
38007,Same page. Just keep moving.,dwight,5
38009,Which we can't know.,dwight,4
38011,Unless we're unplugged.,dwight,3
38013,And wake up in the future.,dwight,6
38015,What?,dwight,1
38019,What?,dwight,1
38020,"I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it.",dwight,25
38021,Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play.,andy,9
38022,You have no idea what you're talking about.,michael,8
38023,I know it's like cricket.,andy,5
38024,"You don't. No, no.",michael,4
38025,"And it's--there's-- well, home plate is like a wicket.",andy,9
38027,Seems pretty well liked by the team.,andy,7
38028,"Okay, well, that's because he's paying their salary.",michael,8
38029,You do know that high school coaches don't pay their players.,andy,11
38030,"I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism.",michael,11
38031,"$30,000? There's gotta be another way.",dwight,6
38033,"Look, I will not pay.",dwight,5
38035,Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?',dwight,10
38037,Agreed. [shakes hands with Angela],dwight,5
38038,"Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.",dwight,13
38039,But not in your bed. It's lumpy.,dwight,7
38041,Fine. Five times. [signs contract],dwight,5
38044,No.,dwight,1
38046,Do you understand how rare is that in nature?,dwight,9
38048,"Great game, coach.",andy,3
38049,"Shh! Okay, all right. Don't, don't.",michael,6
38050,You guys are awesome! Best game I've ever seen in my life.,andy,12
38052,Ha. The other guys can go die.,andy,7
38053,[whispers] Okay.,michael,2
38054,Baseball! Go talk to him.,andy,5
38055,No. God. You go talk to him.,michael,7
38057,Shane. Great game man!,andy,4
38059,"No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us.",andy,8
38061,Ha. No. No. But we're gay for baseball. [chuckles],andy,9
38063,"But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot.",andy,12
38065,Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage.,andy,9
38067,"I mean, isn't marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let's round you out as a person.",andy,36
38069,"I get it, man. I love it. That's what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife.",andy,36
38071,Of course.,andy,2
38073,"But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!",andy,11
38074,"No, no, no.",michael,3
38075,"Come on, get over here.",andy,5
38076,"I'm good. Oh, my God.",michael,5
38077,"Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.",andy,11
38078,Sorry. I got some stomach cramps.,michael,6
38080,"Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart's still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, 'I'm sleeping with your wife.' And you know who does that? James freakin' Bond.",michael,49
38081,"Okay, orange slices. There ya go.",michael,6
38083,Don't thank me. Thank Dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!,michael,15

38091,"I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior.",andy,31
38092,Did you talk to him?,pam,5
38093,I did.,michael,2
38094,You talked to the man whose wife you're having an affair with.,pam,12
38097,No. We just talked. He's very nice.,michael,7

38137,"Well, it does and it doesn't.",pam,6
38139,A place?,jim,2
38141,You sleep in the warehouse?,pam,5
38143,Okay.,jim,1
38145,Okay.,pam,1

38152,Do you want someone to stop you? 'Cause no one's going to.,andy,12
38153,Nobody better try to stop me. Good. [leaves the office. door closes],michael,12
38154,I could have stopped him.,dwight,5

38164,Yes?,michael,1
38166,"[sighs] Umm... I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to... the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.",michael,40
38168,Oh. Okay. I was talking about... what do-- what? What's going on?,michael,12
38169,"[on Youtube video] There is nothing wrong, nor will there ever be wrong with any Sabre printers. Case closed. [phone rings, Michael picks it up] Michael Scott, as seen on TV.",michael,31

38199,"So unfair. Even if I thought that our printers killed baby seals, I would not be a whistleblower. The Bernards, for generations, have silenced whistleblowers. It's how we made all our money. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about us. [sings] Old Mr. Bernard, old Mr. Bernard, who have you silenced today?",andy,51

38254,Oh my god. Was she cute?,michael,6
38256,"Oh, god, Darryl!",michael,3
38257,"I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now he's probably going to get fired for it. And if that is not poetic justice, I don't know what is.",michael,47

38270,What was you? You were the leak?,jim,7
38271,Okay. I'm talking to this woman at daycare...,pam,8
38272,Uh-huh.,jim,1
38273,"She's telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously!",pam,22
38274,Why'd you do that?,jim,4
38275,Her husband's a reporter.,pam,4
38276,Yeah.,jim,1
38277,"So now everyone hates Andy, and it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do.",pam,17
38278,"Okay, just relax. Just need to relax.",jim,7
38279,I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael.,pam,9
38280,This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.,jim,20
38281,You leaked it?,michael,3

38284,That fast?,pam,2

38286,Two whistleblowers... two! I always thought Darryl and Pam might get me fired for something I said.,michael,17
38287,"[Michael knocks on Pam's desk] Yeah? [Michael points at Pam, himself, and Meredith, mimes drinking, driving, then points to his watch and holds up five fingers] I weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me.",pam,35

38290,[in Meredith's van] I have never seen so many parking tickets.,pam,11

38294,What do we got?,michael,4
38295,Um...,pam,1
38297,We're not going for yogurt.,pam,5

38305,"Okay, here's what we do. I say we just smash all the computers. We destroy the evidence. No evidence, no case.",michael,21
38306,Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers?,pam,9
38307,"No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers.",michael,9
38309,I don't think that's a good idea.,pam,7
38310,Just don't say no.,michael,4
38313,"That's just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let's just...",michael,14
38314,"Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.",pam,31
38315,Okay. You can count on me.,michael,6
38316,[sees Toby banging on the vending machine] Let me give you a hand.,dwight,13

38320,Basement office? You mean like a lair?,dwight,7
38321,Hey Jo.,michael,2
38325,What?,michael,1
38326,It doesn't matter what I know.,michael,6
38328,Why?,michael,1
38330,"Well, deal with this. [crosses arms]",michael,6
38332,What?,michael,1
38334,Are you going to kill me?,michael,6
38337,Okay.,dwight,1
38339,"Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make 'em an offer they can't refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don't call me 'til you have it.",dwight,35

38346,What? Based on what?,andy,4
38348,All right. Sounds good.,dwight,4
38349,"Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy.",jim,20
38350,"Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been... Jim.",andy,14
38351,Really?,jim,1
38353,I have rights.,michael,3
38355,I am not going to tell you anything.,michael,8
38357,"Well, I'm going through a little bit of a rough patch.",michael,11
38359,"Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down.",michael,8
38361,"And my new favorite restaurant sucks... I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? ... I miss Holly.",michael,54
38363,Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.,michael,29
38365,"Oh, just...",dwight,2
38367,"Gabe, I told you all about the printers.",andy,8
38368,"I mean, it could be you, Gabe. I mean, that's the point.",jim,12
38369,"Yes, it's totally obvious.",pam,4
38379,"Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally.",jim,8
38381,No... sport.,jim,2
38385,You're going to believe that guy?,andy,6
38387,"Hmm, hmm.",michael,2
38389,"You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you.",michael,15
38391,"I, I surely do, and don't call me honey. [Jo laughs] You were playing too.",michael,15
38392,"I'm about to buy this building, you know.",dwight,8
38394,"Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace.",dwight,23
38395,"Hey Phyllis, have you seen my bag?",andy,7
38397,"Look, I didn't want houses and schools to burn down, and children to die. Does that make me a hero? I...",andy,21
38399,"Well, it doesn't make me the worst guy in the world, either.",andy,12
38402,Hey.,andy,1
38404,"Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do.",andy,13
38408,That was fun.,michael,3
38410,Thanks. Today helped.,michael,3
38412,"Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua.",michael,9
38423,"Go, go, go, go!",andy,4
38424,[performs magic-tricks while lip-syncing],michael,4
38426,"Hiya! Ha! [climbs on Phyllis' desk and starts kicking things off, bites off the head of a stuffed animal]",dwight,19
38429,"[song ends] Toby, how did we do?",andy,7
38431,Whoo! We did it! [everyone starts cheering],andy,7
38433,"Brocolli Rob, obviously, will be there.",andy,6
38435,"And JC. We call him Blorville, because he looks like a black Orville Redenbacher.",andy,14
38438,Hey!,andy,1
38440,Not at all.,andy,3
38444,"Am I angry that Gabe stole my girlfriend over the summer? No. I've been through anger-management, OK? So right now, I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, it's a humpback whale. How pretty. He's eating Gabe.",andy,46
38445,[goes to change thermostat as Dwight puts a locked cover over it] Hey. What are you doing?,pam,17
38446,"From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack.",dwight,11
38448,"Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy.",dwight,15
38449,"Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people.  Oh, you did hear.",jim,29
38450,"[drinking from Camelback] Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably.  Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration.",dwight,25
38451,"Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list.",dwight,23
38459,"New guy sucks. Calls me the Nard-Man. I'm the Nard-Dog, okay? Nard-man is my father.",andy,15
38461,"That kid is the worst. Needs to be fired, Michael.",andy,10
38462,"He's not the worst, okay? He's not the worst. You know who's the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though. [starts drinking coffee] Ah! It's not cappuccino.",michael,45
38465,"It's just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I'll look into it, okay?",michael,11
38466,"Wow, that's a lot of keys.",jim,6
38467,"The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.",dwight,10
38468,"That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.",jim,13
38469,Where?,dwight,1
38470,I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these. [pulls out stethoscope],jim,37
38471,Give me that.,dwight,3
38472,"Yep. Wait, and this. [hands Dwight a hammer]",jim,8
38473,Yes.,dwight,1
38474,Go get 'em.,jim,3
38475,"What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.",jim,21
38476,"[Jim quietly takes Dwight's keychain and starts adding keys to it, Pam giggles] Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys. [removes keys and throws them at Jim] Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim.",dwight,38
38477,Sorry.,pam,1
38478,"Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but...",jim,35
38479,It was really funny.,pam,4
38480,"Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.",jim,9
38481,I love you.,pam,3
38488,"Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me.",michael,13
38490,To get some ice cream for everybody. It's national ice cream afternoon. Great.,michael,13
38491,"And another thing I did this summer, I hired my nephew.",michael,11
38493,Don't bother Luke.,michael,3
38494,Why is there a circle with a line through it?,pam,10
38495,"That means don't. Haven't you seen Ghostbusters, Pam?",michael,8
38497,"No, it... Yes, okay, right. [erases don't] All right, yep. My bad. I got it. Here we go. [writes 'Don't'  in front of symbol]",michael,25
38499,"Come on. Okay, um... [draws a circle around 'Don't' with a line through it] That's as clear as I can make it.",michael,22
38501,Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us.,michael,22
38502,Who's gonna tell on us? Gabe?,dwight,6
38504,"Nope, it won't be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke.",michael,20
38505,How close?,dwight,2
38506,"Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?",michael,12
38507,Yes. Of course.,dwight,3
38509,"No. No, Toby. He's not. Yes he is. He's my nephew.",michael,11
38511,Luke is my nephew.,michael,4
38513,"Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.",michael,20
38515,Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.,michael,45
38516,"Oh, man, so many points being made.",jim,7
38518,"God, when he needed help on Earth, who did he hire? Jesus Christ, his son.",michael,15
38520,Thank you.,michael,2
38521,But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.,jim,10
38522,"No! No. I'm just saying, why does God get to do something that I don't?",michael,15
38524,"Well, then, why aren't you bugging me to fire everybody who's bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That's reverse nepotism.  He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!",michael,40
38529,Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!,michael,3
38531,Or enough for everyone?,pam,4
38534,"Clutch cream run, bro.",andy,4
38535,"Get whatever you want, on me.",pam,6
38536,You really think you can make it up to me with food?,jim,12
38537,I don't know. That usually works.,pam,6
38538,"I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, so he's become a monster. I need to make this right.",pam,38
38540,"Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off!",michael,10
38542,"All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store.",michael,12
38543,"Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, 'I don't own an Ebay store,' so...",jim,28
38544,"Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project.",michael,22
38548,I'm reconsidering sending them back anyway.,michael,6
38549,"You get that kid to open this car, or I'm gonna do it myself... by calling Tripple A.",andy,18
38550,Wait a minute.,michael,3
38552,"Don't-all right. Well, ok, you've just committed a felony.",michael,9
38555,"This kid's costing us sales, Michael.",andy,6
38557,"No, I know they fit. It's not about the fit.",michael,10
38559,Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.,michael,13
38562,You don't have all the facts.,michael,6
38564,I love him.,michael,3
38566,No. No. He's my nephew.,michael,5
38568,"Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool.",michael,23
38570,I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump.,michael,12
38574,"Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses 'Doors closed' the doors open. Or he presses 'lobby' it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?",pam,27
38576,Dwight is about to get so Pammed.,pam,7
38577,"Hey, did you SMS text message me?",dwight,7
38578,"Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.",pam,12
38579,"[as elevator doors won't shut] Okay, that's weird. Just hitting 'door closed.' What?",dwight,13
38580,There we go.,pam,3

38615,I had to do that.,michael,5
38617,All right. Are we good? [Luke runs out crying] You're okay. He's okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.,michael,23
38622,You follow him on Twitter?,jim,5
38625,"Yes, of course. What is this in reference to?",michael,9
38626,Pam?,jim,1
38627,"Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight.",pam,11
38628,I did not do this.,jim,5
38629,"I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video.",pam,14
38630,This is impressive.,jim,3
38631,"Well, you know... they don't call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing.",pam,14
38632,Do they call you that?,jim,5
38633,They do call me that.,pam,5
38634,"Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down.",jim,10
38635,"Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there's pee on the floor.",pam,13

38637,Yeah.,pam,1
38638,Great.,jim,1

38644,[Dwight starts aggressively spanking Andy] Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Whoa. Dwight! Stop!,andy,11
38646,That's it? Really? That's nothing. All right. That's highway robbery.,michael,10

38652,Is there another option?,michael,4
38654,Wow. Late every day this week.,dwight,6
38655,We signed Cici up for this daycare. It's on the other side of town. The traffic...,pam,16
38656,Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?,dwight,22
38657,Is there really?,jim,3
38658,"Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha [laughing maniacally] Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea.",dwight,45
38659,Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers.,dwight,11
38660,Aaah!,jim,1
38662,You remember my cousin Mose.,dwight,5
38664,Were you painting in the dark?,pam,6
38665,Wait. Is this your place Dwight?,jim,6
38666,Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?,dwight,17
38667,I don't really think we need...,pam,6
38668,Oh... lets take the tour Pam.,jim,6
38669,Yeah.,pam,1
38670,Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters. [pause] I see you found out magical toy box Jim.,dwight,26
38671,These are actually forks and knives from the break room.,jim,10
38672,"Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child's imagination that's Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and... Ms. Fork.",dwight,22
38673,And a soy sauce packet.,pam,5

38679,Prove it.,jim,2
38680,What?,dwight,1
38681,"Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works.",jim,17
38682,"Oh no, no, no.",dwight,4
38683,"But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good.",jim,15

38686,This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it!,michael,18
38687,"Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It's over. It's done. But my punishment is ... um ... worse than hell.",michael,28
38689,I know what you want to ask me. 'Did your mom ever see you naked?',michael,15
38691,"So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don't think so. We're going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That's the key.",michael,32
38692,"Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!",dwight,17

38697,"Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim.",dwight,8

38699,You don't want to know.,dwight,5

38706,Tell me I'm good at sales.,pam,6
38707,You're good... you're good at sales.,jim,6
38708,"The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that's fair.",pam,29
38709,Dwight?,andy,1
38710,What?,dwight,1
38711,Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the 'F' word?,andy,20
38712,Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients.,dwight,15
38714,"Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They're 'appearance'ists!",dwight,11
38715,"Ok, Dwight. We can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened?",jim,15
38716,"Yeah, what happened Dwight?",pam,4
38717,Ok.,jim,1
38719,So what happened?,pam,3
38720,"I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough for precious heirlooms.",dwight,53
38724,"Wait, wait, wait. That's actually a really good idea Kelly.",jim,10
38727,"Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.",jim,23
38728,"No, you and I... and I. I'm going to come with you.",andy,12
38729,Ok,dwight,1
38730,Alright.,jim,1
38731,Did you assume that I would automatically side with the rich snobby shop owner? [removes cuff link] How about now? [removes other cuff link] How about now? [removes tie clip] How about now?,andy,33
38733,One hour.,michael,2
38735,"One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today.",michael,23
38737,"No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time.",michael,21

38759,"Toby, can I really tell you anything?",michael,7
38763,"A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn't there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?",pam,30

38992,She's babysitting?,andy,2
38994,"I understand. This is, like, huge opportunity for her.",andy,9
38995,[trying to stuff balloons below the seats] This is ridiculous. You'd think they'd discourage people from bringing in balloons.,michael,19

39031,We can relax. Let's get our Sweeney on.,jim,8

39585,Yes!,andy,1
39586,There he is.,dwight,3
39587,"Oh, no, that's a male model.",michael,6
39588,"No, that's him.",jim,3
39589,"That...hello. Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company.",michael,6
39591,Nice to meet you.,michael,4
39593,"Yeah, well...we call it overkill. Why am I telling you my strategy?",michael,12
39595,All right.,michael,2
39597,Buh-bye. I could swear that guy was a male model.,michael,10
39599,"Oh, thank you. All right. On the count of three, it's showtime. Ready, one, two--",michael,15
39600,"Nope, not doing that.",jim,4
39601,I've been in showtime mode since breakfast.,dwight,7
39602,"Okay, you know-all right, just forget it then.",michael,8
39603,Showtime!,jim,1
39604,It's showtime! Oh...never mind. Let's go.,michael,6
39605,"When I knock on your door, you know who it is; it's Michael Scott. We've been together forever and we-",michael,20
39607,"You know what? You are having some problems with your loading dock, are you not? All right. We're going to deliver to you on weekends.",michael,25
39609,"And you know what else we're gonna do? I can't believe I'm gonna say this...we are going to offer you our paper at cost. I know. I could get in a lotta trouble for this, so you'd better shake my hand right now.",michael,43
39610,He's not kidding.,dwight,3
39611,"Shake it, shake it!",michael,4
39613,Oh.,dwight,1
39615,Okay. Thank you.,michael,3
39617,"Thanks, Steve.",michael,2
39618,Jim talked too much.,dwight,4
39619,"No, I didn't.",jim,3
39620,"Yes, you did.",dwight,3
39621,"Stop it. Just stop it. We did what we should have done, we just got bested. [pounds the elevator button] Why is there a door close button if it doesn't even close the door?",michael,34
39622,"How do I feel about losing the sale? It's like if Michael Phelps came out of retirement, jumped in the pool, belly-flopped, and drowned.",michael,24
39623,"You know who we always lose out to? Staples, the big guys. Osprey? They're a small company. They're smaller than we are. What's our excuse? How do we combat this guy? Stanley, how do we combat him?",michael,37
39625,"Okay. You know what? You clearly don't care, so why don't you just leave?",michael,14
39627,"Why don't you go outside and...take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay?",michael,15
39629,"I don't know, your frame, your build-why don't you have a glass of apple juice and tell me you're not a diabetic. [Stanley stands to leave] See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay. Yes, Phyllis?",michael,44
39631,"Oh, my god!",michael,3
39632,I know how we can learn his tricks.,dwight,8
39633,What I am about to show you is of the utmost secrecy.,dwight,12
39634,Is that your office?,jim,4
39635,"Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell.",dwight,21
39639,You know what this is? This is a stinger.,michael,9
39640,A what?,jim,2
39641,Like the movie.,michael,3
39642,I think you mean The Sting.,jim,6
39643,"Paul Newman, Robert Redford. They're bank robbers.",michael,7
39644,Nope. Different movie.,jim,3
39645,The Sting. The Sting.,dwight,4
39648,Meredith was the perfect choice to play the head of the company. Her lunch break lined up with our appointment with Danny and...that's it. That's really all we were looking for.,jim,31
39651,Meredith Van Helsing?,jim,3
39652,Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer.,dwight,12
39653,Okay. But what is he more famous for?,jim,8
39654,Shhh! Hey! That's my mug.,michael,5
39655,"You know this isn't real TV, right?",jim,7
39656,Yes.,michael,1
39658,[in falsetto] Please Mr. President-,andy,5
39660,Yeah.,andy,1
39662,"Yeah, but I'm using my falsetto.",andy,6
39664,"Yeah, well, it'd sound a lot better if you actually sang with some soul.",andy,14
39666,That's a lie.,andy,3
39668,I just was hoping to maybe save your voice in case we did a novelty song about frogs.,andy,18
39670,"Okay, three-way argument between a drummer, a keyboardist, and the front man lead singer. Wonder who's gonna win this one. Two, three, four-",andy,23
39673,"Oh, no, no. No. Don't-",michael,5
39674,"People can't keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire.",dwight,18
39675,Testify.,michael,1
39676,"Okay, he's not that good-looking. I don't understand why everybody's obsessed with this-",jim,13
39677,"Yeah, he is that good-looking.",michael,5
39678,"He's very, very handsome.",dwight,4
39679,Okay.,michael,1
39681,"Pull it together, all right? Stop lookin' at him.",michael,9
39685,Oh...my god! He's making her sell to him.,michael,8
39686,[everyone finishes listening to song] Okay. Honest feedback time. Oscar?,andy,10
39688,But do you think it could be famous? Like in a car commercial or something?,andy,15
39689,Not really. It's kinda weird that a grown man is singing from the point of view of a little girl.,pam,20
39690,"I feel like I can see someone ice skating to it. You know, like in the Olympics.",andy,17
39692,Rude. And not helpful.,andy,4
39694,"Well, that...really bums me out.",andy,5
39699,Stay-,michael,1
39702,Oh...,dwight,1
39704,Oh!,michael,1
39705,"Oh, man!",dwight,2
39707,We gotta get someone else in there right now.,jim,9
39708,You're an exec at Pennsylvania Solartech and-,jim,7
39710,What do you mean?,jim,4
39711,"I told you! You're an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father-",dwight,16
39712,"Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?",jim,16
39714,So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.,jim,17
39716,Then make him pitch to you.,dwight,6
39717,Yes.,jim,1
39718,We gotta see what he's got.,dwight,6
39719,Exactly. You can do this.,jim,5
39720,"Okay, and remember-you're not gay.",dwight,5
39721,Stop it! It's gonna be great.,jim,6
39723,"And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it.",jim,9
39729,Who else we got?,jim,4
39730,Okay. You're a young hotshot from Stark Industries. You've just bought this company. Meredith is fired. It's a whole new regime. He's gotta pitch to you now.,dwight,27
39732,Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.,jim,9
39733,Don't let us down.,michael,4
39739,"No, no, no....",michael,3
39740,"No, no, no, no...",jim,4
39741,I'm goin 'in!,michael,3
39742,"Michael! No, Michael, stop it! No!",dwight,6
39743,"Stop, stop! Oh, my god! [enters office] Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop.",michael,20
39745,"I said stop. Okay, Danny...this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-",michael,18
39747,"Don't! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.",michael,14
39749,"I owe you...a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.",michael,29
39751,A surveillance room next to this one.,michael,7
39753,Yes. And it's the sincerest form of flattery.,michael,8
39755,Well-,michael,1
39757,"Okay. You know what, it wasn't just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.",michael,26
39758,No!,dwight,1
39759,"No, no, no, no.",jim,4
39761,"No, we don't. Here's-here's my point. Danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this. We just-we wanted to know your tricks.",michael,26
39763,"You are, you are. You are! Stop it, stop it. Stop. [closes door] You are a good salesman. And because of that...I want you to work for me.",michael,28
39765,"So, you will?",michael,3
39767,"Hold it, hold it. [forcing door closed] Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same?",michael,41
39769,"Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?",michael,10
39771,"I know, I know.",michael,4
39773,"Do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?",michael,12
39775,"I can give you more money-there's your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-there's your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?",michael,50
39776,"Everyone, may I have your attention? I would like to introduce you to Mr. Danny Cordray. He is going to be joining us as our new traveling salesman. Say hello to Danny!",michael,32
39778,"O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site...or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?",michael,47
39781,No. No. No. Somebody in this office.,michael,7
39783,"Thanks, Kevin.",andy,2
39784,"No, me. Right? Sorta like...a little younger version of me.",michael,10
39786,Michael?,dwight,1
39787,Yes.,michael,1
39788,Can I talk to you about something?,dwight,7
39789,"No, you may not.",michael,4
39790,It's about this very announcement you just made.,dwight,8
39791,I said no.,michael,3
39792,Michael-,dwight,1
39793,We're not-,michael,2
39794,"Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.",jim,10
39795,"Okay. Let's-all right, all right. Let's talk. Please don't let him leave. [pointing to Danny] Don't leave. Don't let him.",michael,20
39797,You hired him?,jim,3
39798,"Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?",michael,20
39800,"Okay. Well...get ready, 'cause it's gonna get better.",michael,8
39802,"No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can't now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, he's going to steal sales for us.",michael,32
39803,Where's he gonna sit? There's no more seats.,dwight,8
39804,"He doesn't need to sit, he's a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.",michael,41
39806,Where's he gonna park? There's no more reserved parking spots.,dwight,10
39807,Good-bye!,michael,1
39811,Reverse snobbery.,andy,2
39813,Sometimes I feel like life has passed me by.,andy,9
39816,Holy crap. Are you kidding me? You just made that-that's amazing!,andy,11
39818,[singing] Which me am I gonna be today?,andy,8
39820,I gotta closet full of mes. Am I gonna be the happy me?,andy,13
39822,"Oh, my gosh! We're almost out of time. How much for another half hour?",andy,14
39824,Wait. Seriously?,andy,2
39826,"So we're just, like, jamming as friends?",andy,7
39828,Closet full of mes-,andy,4
39830,Did ya?,jim,2
39832,I'm just kidding. She told me about it.,jim,8
39834,Oh.,jim,1
39836,You snubbed her.,dwight,3
39837,"Dwight, please.",jim,2
39840,"Oh, that's different, is it? Okay...thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay. [awkward pause] So...you're gonna be workin' here?",dwight,33
39842,Welcome aboard.,dwight,2
39844,"Hey, crazy, um...so...that's it? You're just-you're fine?",jim,7
39845,"It's after 5:00, Jim. I'm not gonna take this home. [shakes Danny's hand]",dwight,13
39847,Pleasure.,dwight,1
39849,"This morning, Danny Cordray stole a sale from me. So what do I do? I go out and I steal Danny Cordray. The sale that mattered, I made. Boom. Funny thing about it, we don't even need him. We already have Packer on the road. Chhguuh! Crap. I forgot about Packer.",michael,51
39853,[falsetto] I'll be your croak madame.,andy,6
39857,"Croak, croak, croak. Bullfrog in love.",andy,6
39859,Ribbit!,andy,1
39862,"What about this one? It's kinda badass, right? Just seems kinda crazy in a way I might need right now.",andy,20
39863,"I don't know. [looks at Stanley, who took his mug and is drinking out of it] Oh! That's... not... yours.",jim,20
39864,"Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won't notice?",jim,35
39868,"[shirtless, wearing only a tie] Handbag.",andy,6
39870,Shh! Shhh! [watches Jim put a cardboard box over Stanley's monitor],andy,11
39871,"[standing outside the conference room, wearing fake teeth, watching Stanley walk in] All right, everybody, take a seat. As you may have heard, our branch on the planet Jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales!",michael,36
39874,"[turns around, is wearing a mustache] Bye, Stanley! Love you! [waves, Stanley leaves]",pam,13
39875,"[standing next to a pony] So long, Stanley!",dwight,8
39881,"People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!",pam,35
39882,Stop.,jim,1
39883,"[has his hands around Jim's neck] Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me.",dwight,32
39884,Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler.,jim,14
39885,To my chickens I'm the Scranton Strangler.  [looks at Pam] Oh-ho! That's very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute's mom.,dwight,27
39886,What?,pam,1
39887,You're only one third as beautiful and only half her height.,dwight,11
39888,"I'm supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, but... Jim doesn't want to put his costume on.",pam,26
39889,[places pipe in mouth] I am Popeye!,jim,7
39890,"I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number [holds up Popeye costume, shakes head] ...no.",jim,41
39892,MACGRUBER!,michael,1
39894,"Oh, here we go!",michael,4
39896,[laughs] OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?,michael,18
39897,Lake Erie.,dwight,2
39899,"So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?",michael,14
39905,Blackula!,michael,1
39907,"Oh, so... I almost forgot. You'll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. That's like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.",michael,32
39909,"Yeah. I'm sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man.",michael,14
39911,Really? We're good?,michael,3
39913,Okay. [reaches out and shakes Darryl's hand] Okay.,michael,8
39915,Oh. It's a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.,michael,11
39916,Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what I'd like? I would like to have all the racists brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they're missing.,michael,38
39934,Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?,dwight,22
39937,"So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.",jim,40
39938,We were basically Romeo and Juliet.,pam,6
39939,That's right.,jim,2
39940,Except where Juliet doesn't have that great a time and Romeo doesn't call back after two dates.,pam,17
39941,Yikes.,jim,1
39942,But I've learned to love again. [puts her arm on Jim's shoulder] He's a cartoon sailor.,pam,16
39943,"Oh, no.",jim,2
39944,And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?,pam,8
39945,"No. No, I'm not gonna-no.",jim,5
39946,Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party?,andy,10
39947,I don't care.,jim,3
39949,You know what else? [pulling fake teeth out of his mouth] The-this... this sucks for Jim. Right? But it also sucks for us. Because we don't get invited to a ton of Halloween parties. [puts teeth back in],andy,38
39951,[removes teeth] Creed's going?!,andy,4
39952,Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.,jim,20
39953,Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?,michael,15
39955,"Hi, Darryl, come out here, please.",michael,6
39957,"You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!",michael,17
39959,"Yeah, I bet it is! If you're gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed.",michael,20
39961,"[leans over toward Erin] Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before... or sit on it.",pam,23
39962,This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.,michael,26
39964,"I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don't care if I take a bullet. We're gonna call them, we're gonna put them on speakerphone right now...",michael,53
39966,And we are going to straighten this out.,michael,8
39967,Screw corporate! They probably stole the idea anyway.,andy,8
39968,Mmhm!,michael,1
39970,I'm a little peeved at Darryl right now.,michael,8
39971,He went to Gabe behind your back.,dwight,7
39972,"No, he didn't go behind my back. He went over my head.",michael,12
39973,He went over your head to go behind your back.,dwight,10
39974,What is taking someone from behind?,michael,6
39975,"No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.",dwight,19
39976,"It was a good idea, though.",michael,6
39977,Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea.,dwight,15
39978,"Hey, Danny.",andy,2
39980,"I'm really sorry, but we can't come to your party tonight.",andy,11
39982,You were?,andy,2
39985,"We're just like, totally caught in the middle here.",andy,9
39987,Well Jim and Pam basically begged us not to go...,andy,10
40004,"Garbage magnet. [throws magnet] Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design. [to Michael] I can't believe this doesn't make you mad!",dwight,31
40005,[staring at Gabe and Kevin] What the hell are they talking about?,michael,12
40006,"Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.",dwight,12
40007,"Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don't-[sees Kevin and Gabe fist-bump] Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?",michael,58
40009,"Oh, you're sorry?",michael,3
40011,What did you just thought?,michael,5
40013,All right.,michael,2
40015,Okay.,michael,1
40017,"Well, don't let it happen again.",michael,6
40019,I-,michael,1
40023,That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.,jim,15
40025,"Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It's not even a history.",pam,15
40027,It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about?,jim,17
40029,It was two.,pam,3
40031,"No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don't know, you never called me back, so...",pam,20
40032,Oooh! You can't handle the truth! [laughs],jim,7
40034,"Yeah? [stops laughing] It was though, that's what happened.",pam,9
40036,Hmm-mm.,pam,1
40037,"Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga. That's not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other.",michael,55
40039,You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.,michael,22
40041,"Okay, that might help. If you said 'I'm sorry' in front of everybody.",michael,13
40043,In front of me.,michael,4
40045,So that's it.,michael,3
40047,Is it?,michael,2
40049,"Sookehhh. [removes teeth] Bill Compton, from True Blood.",andy,8
40055,"Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself.",pam,23
40057,"Yeah, I gotta get in on this. [mocking Darryl] Hey, it's cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive! And I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!",michael,40
40058,Still don't know who I am? I'll give you a hint. I go over other people's heads.,michael,17
40059,"Michael, this is a bad idea.",pam,6
40060,What's a bad idea?,michael,4
40061,"Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?",pam,12
40062,"NEVER! [tosses wig] Okay, you know what? Fine.  I'm not Darryl. And thank God I'm not Darryl.",michael,18
40066,Angela as the nurse!,pam,4
40069,"Hey, can I play? Why don't you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?",michael,20
40070,We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?,jim,16
40072,Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it.,michael,7
40074,"Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?",michael,7
40075,Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.,dwight,15
40076,"I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.",dwight,30
40077,If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be?,michael,16
40084,Hey.,jim,1
40086,"When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back?",jim,27
40088,"Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is...",jim,28
40090,Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.,jim,16
40092,Nope.,jim,1
40098,I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it.,pam,8
40099,Just tell her the real reason.,jim,6
40101,Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.,jim,9
40102,"I did. And it's just one of those things that's going to keep gnawing at me, like 'gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn't he? I have no idea why.'",pam,28
40104,"Hey, man.",jim,2
40105,"Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? [gibberish sounds] Okay. Well, excuuuuse me.",pam,25
40107,Thank you.,michael,2
40110,"If they're good ideas, I'm not gonna say no!",michael,9
40112,"That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?",michael,22
40114,Oh...,michael,1
40116,Well...,michael,1
40119,"Stop it! Stop, stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it.",michael,10
40121,"You don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.",michael,51
40124,I am not budging on the hat issue.,michael,8
40126,Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.,michael,15
40128,"Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call.",michael,17
40130,Sorry I was a jerk.,michael,5

40132,"What's up, man?",andy,3
40134,"When I was a freshman in college, I worked at the student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun? This was at Cornell. I had to write an op-ed column every day.  Bernard's Regards.",andy,33
40138,"To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back?",jim,20
40139,"Oh, wow!",pam,2
40140,[holding Cece] Spinach in a can. Power eat spinach. [Popeye sound],jim,11
40141,"Aww, my hero!",pam,3
40142,"Okay, everyone, I've tallied the votes, and the winner... of the costume celebration spectacular... and the Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book... Oscar Martinez.",pam,22
40146,"I know a lot of us have been feeling under the weather lately. It's that time of year. And according to a study done by the University of Arizona, they've discovered that your keyboards have hundreds of times more bacteria, per square inch, than a toilet seat.",pam,47
40148,"That's true, that's true. I dated her momma, and you know what-",michael,12
40149,Stop.,jim,1
40150,"[under his breath] Um... kay. Uh, alright.",michael,7
40151,One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.,pam,21
40153,"Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this. [coughs into elbow]",pam,20
40154,Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? [looks at camera] 'Cause of the euro.,dwight,24
40155,"Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don't come in if you're sick.",pam,27
40156,[rolls his eyes and shakes his head] Uh...,dwight,8
40157,"And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.",pam,17
40158,"NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.",dwight,9
40159,Elaborate.,jim,1
40160,"The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter...",dwight,47
40161,I'm not - I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that.,pam,15
40162,Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.,dwight,12
40163,"So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.",jim,15
40164,Yes. I would welcome it.,dwight,5
40165,"[sneezes on Dwight, looks at camera] You're welcome.",jim,8
40166,"The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever.",dwight,33
40168,Cece's getting christened today.,pam,4
40169,Big day.,jim,2
40170,Everyone from work is here. We weren't planning on that.,pam,10

40175,"Oh, yes. [mimicking smoking] Doobie-doobie doo.",michael,6
40176,"I invited everyone in the office because it's not a day for just Jim or Pam or the baby or me. It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate... my joy. And our, all of ours joys.",michael,41

40178,"Does the Nard-dog want Nard-pups? Yeah. I want a big ol' litter of Nard-pups. All jumping around, sucking on the teet. Put 'em in a box, give 'em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids.",andy,35

40182,"Oh, Michael, this is just for family.",pam,7
40183,But I'm the Godfather.,michael,4
40184,"It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.",jim,20
40185,Are you talking to me?,michael,5
40186,"[whispers to Pam] Ok, your turn.",jim,6
40187,Scooch. Before I shoot you in the head.,michael,8
40188,"Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, I'm so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know you're not Cece's godfather.",pam,30
40189,Yeah.,michael,1
40190,"I'm sorry, Michael. I need you to say it. I'm so sorry.",pam,12
40191,[normal voice] I'm not the godfather.,michael,6
40192,"Okay, thank you.",pam,3
40193,[clears his throat] So who is the godfather?,michael,8
40194,"Our friend, Seth, and his wife there.",pam,7
40195,"Okay. Old friend, like, you've known him since kindergarten?",michael,9
40196,"No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. They're a great couple. You should meet them later.",pam,18
40197,"No, I have plenty of friends, so... all right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show.",michael,17
40198,"Okay. Thank you for coming, Michael.",pam,6
40199,"I don't even know how to say this, but Cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. And that's not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out.",michael,31
40203,Good morning.,michael,2
40212,[looking at Cece's diaper] Somebody needs a change.,pam,8
40213,Right now?,jim,2
40214,"Well, she can't bring this up with her.",pam,8
40215,"Okay. All right, come on. [picks up Cece from Pam, whispers to her] Where are we going? Where are we going? We're gonna take a little field trip.",jim,28
40216,"[whispering, going into the bathroom with Cece] Okay. Okay. There's my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What's that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!",jim,40
40217,[seeing Jim come in with Cece wearing an old t-shirt] What?,pam,11
40218,What?,jim,1
40219,"Honey, no.",pam,2
40220,Yes.,jim,1

40224,No. There's no extra outfit in the bag.,jim,8
40225,You said you checked it.,pam,5
40226,I did... say that.,jim,4
40228,"Jim and Pam and Cece really seem to be clicking. They are totally gelling. It's as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness. And good for them. That's great, because, you know, the paper industry's not gonna last forever.",michael,46
40230,Mm. No. Wrong on both counts.,jim,6
40231,"Okay, 'A,' Halbert. And, 'B,' I think a more appropriate statement would be, 'The 'Halberts' are hosting an intimate reception for their invited guests.'",jim,24

40246,"Oh, well, Dave is an adorable baby.",jim,7
40248,Yeah. [Doug walks away],jim,4
40249,Wow.,pam,1
40251,We just had to add a few more tables. We weren't expecting this many people.,pam,15
40253,"Nope, and we're gonna need a loaves and fishes kind of miracle to feed 'em all.",pam,16
40255,[to Cece] Hm. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous 'cause she doesn't get to come home to someone as cute as you.,pam,23
40256,"Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?",jim,10
40257,I don't know. I'm just hungry.,pam,6
40258,"Okay, well, you know what? Everybody's hungry. [Pam looks at Jim] Sorry. I think I'm just hungry.",jim,17

40292,Who the heck was that?,pam,5
40293,"I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.",jim,10
40294,We need more food. I'll go get some subs and sodas.,pam,11
40295,All right. And cider.,jim,4
40296,[pointing to group of young adults laughing] Look at that. Look at that. That's fun. We need to do stuff together outside of work. Let's go help Africa. Let's go build an airport. We'll start small. We'll have a car wash. We'll send some cheerleaders to regionals.,michael,47
40299,"Yeah, well, that's just a pick-up scene. Okay, we don't have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together.",michael,22
40301,Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party.,michael,14

40309,[on the bus] Hey. Hey. Is this the bus to Mexico?,michael,11

40352,"Well, two days minus how long we've been on the road. 45 minutes? So, like, two days basically. Maybe more.",andy,20
40353,"Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What?",michael,16
40354,"I don't know, I thought it was like a gymnasium or...",andy,11

40365,And Cinco de Mayo.,michael,4
40366,"Nah, no. We'll be back before that.",andy,7
40367,"No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums haven't even started. Now we're those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus.",michael,36

41081,What?,michael,1
41083,So much for keeping our secrets up high.,michael,8
41085,I know what we're going to do. We're going to put our best minds on it.,michael,16
41086,"Everybody stop working. I want you all to imagine a world in which America is not the number one superpower, where forks are irrelevant, and where every man, woman and child is expected to learn how to play the cello. Now open your eyes.",michael,44
41088,Welcome to your future.,michael,4
41090,"How do we stop it? With a big idea. That's what America is built on, big ideas. Blue jeans, the Grand Canyon. Whose got one, whose got a big idea?",michael,30
41091,An idea bigger than the Grand Canyon?,pam,7
41092,"Yes, indeed. Yes Kevin.",michael,4
41094,Once a week antacid is the idea to beat. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay then we are... yes.,michael,17
41097,I don't know.,michael,3
41099,Alright.,michael,1
41102,I don't know what the [expletive] that was.,michael,8
41103,"I say we bomb 'em. By 2020, they're gonna be the world's largest economy and they're getting a taste for protein. We'll all starve.",dwight,24
41105,"No he's not right. We're not. Where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are fifty six cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine.",michael,37
41109,"No, no. That is right now.",michael,6
41111,"In terms of land, not population.",michael,6
41113,"No, no you're wrong about this.",michael,6
41115,I got it from NewYorkTimes.com,michael,5
41117,"Okay, someone look it up.",jim,5
41121,Well are you?,andy,3
41125,"Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.",jim,17
41127,So I happen to know more than the smartest guy in the office. So what? [laughs] I don't care.,michael,19
41128,"Okay, now where were we before I bested Oscar?",michael,9
41133,"Absolutely, Pam this is exactly why I hired you as Office Administrator, handle it. Taking care of business.",michael,18
41134,Dwight take it down.,pam,4
41135,[chuckles],dwight,1
41136,"I'm serious, take it down or else.",pam,7
41137,Or else? Or else what? There's nothing you can do.,dwight,10
41138,We can move out.,pam,4
41140,"So, does anyone wanna know where I've been for the last 2 hours?",pam,13
41141,"Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?",jim,10
41142,I went out to look for a better office space.,pam,10
41143,Waste of time.,dwight,3
41144,"Not really, because I found one.",pam,6
41145,"Oh wow, these are nice.",jim,5
41146,Yup.,pam,1
41147,Let me see.,dwight,3
41148,"Look at the huge offices Jim, check out that conference room.",pam,11
41149,"Yeah, yeah. Totally.",jim,3
41150,You can't just move out.,dwight,5
41151,"Oh in three months we can. Check the lease, and if you don't undo all the changes you've made, we're moving. Hey guys, can I show you some pictures.",pam,29
41152,[without looking at the pictures] Oh my gosh she is so cute. She looks like both of you.,andy,18
41153,They're not of Cece.,pam,4
41154,"Oh, cool.",andy,2
41155,This is possibly our new Dunder Mifflin office.,pam,8
41157,"Well, this building isn't far, and its much newer. There's a dry cleaner, nail place and a gym. Oh, and it's next-door to and Outback so it always smells like steak.",pam,31

41162,White.,pam,1
41164,"Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order.",jim,26
41166,Very comedically humorous Jim.,michael,4
41172,Try 'Control P'.,michael,3
41174,Not if the printer isn't hooked up. You are making some very dangerous assumptions Oscar.,michael,15
41179,"Around here, Oscar is known as 'actually' because he will insert himself into just about any conversation to add facts, or correct grammar. He really does fit that old stereotype of the smug gay Mexican.",jim,35

41183,"Yes, but one good text away from a high five.",andy,10
41185,"Oh, its on.",andy,3

41190,You can't possibly be serious.,dwight,5
41193,Hey.,michael,1
41195,Mmm.,michael,1
41197,Yeah.,michael,1
41199,Sure.,michael,1
41200,"Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?",jim,11
41201,Coffee Jim.,michael,2
41202,No.,jim,1
41203,It is not just coffee.,andy,5
41204,"He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?",jim,59
41205,Yes.,michael,1
41206,And then he will smugly pay the cheque and make you feel so small.,andy,14
41207,"Alright, well I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I don't have time. Okay, okay, I'll just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary.",michael,39
41208,No politics?,jim,2
41209,"I'm pretty good on politics. 'California is bankrupt, and California, California.' [Jim and Andy follow Michael into his office] What?",michael,20
41210,"Parley, my office, five minutes.",dwight,5
41211,Parley?,pam,1
41213,So everyone here knows pirate code?,pam,6
41215,"Pam, I am not an unreasonable man. If you guys stay, I will stop watering down the soap.",dwight,18
41216,You've been watering down the soap?,pam,6
41217,Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?,dwight,15
41218,We need everything back the way it was.,pam,8
41219,"You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous...  for stripping.",dwight,51
41222,Pass.,michael,1
41224,Pass.,michael,1
41225,"Two for two, keep it up.",jim,6
41227,Lifeline.,michael,1
41228,"Damn it. Michael, you are moments away from the smack down of your life. If you don't know something, steer the conversation back to something you do know.",andy,28
41229,I could talk about boobs. I bet he knows nothing about boobs.,michael,12
41230,What do you know about boobs?,jim,6
41231,"Michael, I have to tell you something it's from Rocky II.",andy,11
41232,Thank you.,jim,2
41233,"This guy doesn't just wanna win. Y'know, he want's to bury you. He wants to humiliate you!",andy,17
41234,"Wait, wait, wait. How long is this going to take?",michael,10
41235,I'm like a quarter of the way through.,andy,8
41236,Is it going to be worth it?,michael,7
41237,No.,andy,1
41239,I don't need to cheat.,michael,5
41240,Show him how to use it.,jim,6
41242,"Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that.",dwight,16
41244,There's no building. This could only mean one thing.,dwight,9
41246,"She was lying. Oh, Pam, Pam...",dwight,6
41250,What?,dwight,1
41252,Oh.,dwight,1
41254,I'm sorry. We have a colleague with the same name.,dwight,10
41256,"So, okay. You're not a liar too are you?",dwight,9
41258,"Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it, I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go.",dwight,19
41260,"I can't wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam.",dwight,13
41261,Hey Pam.,dwight,2
41262,Yeah?,pam,1
41263,"Y'know what, I'm the only one here who you haven't asked about the new office.",dwight,15
41264,"I know, because you're the reason we're moving.",pam,8
41265,"Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place?",dwight,28
41266,"Uhh, I think it's something like umm...",pam,7
41267,What's the exact square footage.,dwight,5
41268,"Umm, let me see.",pam,4
41269,How many offices are there? Oh I'll just look at the one sheet myself.,dwight,14
41270,"Oh, actually I don't know what I did with the one sheet. Y'know, that's the problem. You only have one sheet.",pam,21
41271,"[chuckles] You're a funny guy Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm going to walk down the hall and say 'Wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is.' I can't wait.",dwight,45
41272,Mmhmm.,pam,1
41273,I lied about some aspects of the building.,pam,8
41274,It's still on a bike path though right?,jim,8
41275,There's no building... it doesn't exist.,pam,6
41276,What does that mean?,jim,4
41277,"I needed leverage so I pulled those pictures off the internet. It's just this Office Administrator thing, I don't wanna...",pam,20
41278,What?,jim,1
41279,Fail. I don't want to fail... again.,pam,7
41280,But you didn't fail.,jim,4
41281,"And that's what you said about Art School, and that's what you said about sales.",pam,15
41282,And you didn't fail those things either.,jim,7
41283,"Well, I'm not an artist, and I'm not a salesman. So what would you call it?",pam,16
41284,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.",jim,5
41286,"Did you know, that China has a new missile, that can sink a US Naval Carrier nine hundred miles off the coast?",michael,22
41288,"Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal. But what do I know, I mean, that's just according to the Pentagon. Our Pentagon.",michael,28
41290,What?,pam,1
41292,Well thanks.,pam,2
41294,China has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars. We are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives. And they will control us.,michael,28
41296,How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17% and in the US it has only risen by 8%?,michael,27
41298,Don't... I...,michael,2
41299,"Hello, hello. You're breaking the law.",pam,6
41300,"Impossible, I love the law.",dwight,5
41301,"Read article nineteen. There are suitable standards that you have to maintain the building at that includes comfortable temperatures and adequate lighting. It also means no more cutting the tampons in two, and no more tampering with the toilet paper.",pam,40

41304,Reply it!,dwight,2
41306,"Yeah, I figured that.",michael,4
41308,Wait. You forgetting something?,michael,4
41310,"This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you.",michael,18
41312,Here we are.,michael,3
41314,"My point is... that as long as people like you and me don't stop talking, nobody can stop the USA.",michael,20
41315,Yeah. [clapping],andy,2
41319,Raise your cups on high. Case closed.,michael,7
41323,Shhh. You're gonna scare 'em away. [two pigeons are eating out of a soft serve cone],andy,16
41325,Yeah. Right.,andy,2
41328,Okay let's go in. I'm freezing.,pam,6
41329,"People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We're gonna do a fun one.",michael,17
41330,One Charlie's Angels. One. Let's go.,jim,6
41331,"Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge.",pam,18
41333,Let's just jump in the air!,andy,6
41334,That's it! That's a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. We're gonna jump in the air. Here we go.,michael,19
41335,Okay.,pam,1
41337,"Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go.",michael,12
41339,You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping?,jim,8
41340,"I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.",dwight,10
41342,You are?,dwight,2
41344,"Let me see you jump. [Phyllis barely jumps] Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isn't one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that.",dwight,31
41345,I'm freezing.,pam,2
41348,"Well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer. Do that.",andy,15
41350,"Don't answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we're all in the air at the same time. Yes?",michael,27
41352,I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.,michael,11
41354,We didn't get it.,michael,4
41355,"I'm the office administrator now, which means I'm basically being paid to be head of the party planning committee. The first thing I did as head... I shut it down. At its best it was a toxic political club used to make others feel miserable and left out. At its best it planned parties.",pam,54
41356,It hardly looks fake. It's so lush.,pam,7
41357,Why's it smell real? [Pam shows him a hidden car-freshener] Ah... good one.,jim,13
41358,"Oh, ho, ho, ho! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, little children! [dressed as Santa]",michael,17

41362,How's the party coming along?,michael,5
41363,Great.,pam,1
41364,Are we over budget?,michael,4
41365,Nope.,pam,1
41366,No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already?,michael,7
41368,"Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. What's the problem?",michael,11
41370,"So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?",michael,11
41372,"Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?",michael,15
41373,Yea?,andy,1
41374,Whatcha got?,michael,2
41375,"All good, Santa.",andy,3
41376,"Well, that's a relief. Santa's gonna take some much-needed free time. Alright. Good!",michael,13
41377,"My kids are growin up. As a boss, I look at that and say great. It is exactly what a boss would hope would happen because that's what I want. That's what every boss wants is a, is a wonderful Christmas with no drama.",michael,44

41383,Nashua got mp3 players.,pam,4
41388,Oh come on.,dwight,3
41396,"Hey, it's snowing.",jim,3
41397,"[mocking] Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful.",dwight,53
41398,"[Jim goes outside, makes a snowball, and brings it back inside] Hey, Dwight. [Jim throws the snowball at Dwight and everyone laughs]",jim,22
41399,"Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!",dwight,9
41400,"Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right?",jim,11
41401,Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.,dwight,12
41404,You apologize to me right now.,dwight,6
41405,You've got something on your nose.,jim,6
41406,You apologize right now.,dwight,4
41407,No.,jim,1
41408,"Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.",dwight,17
41409,You got it.,jim,3
41410,That sounds awesome. Can we all do it?,andy,8
41411,"No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. [Jim continues to shake Dwight's hand] Jim, let go. Let go.",dwight,27
41423,"Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that...",pam,19
41424,Yeah!,michael,1
41425,A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.,pam,21
41426,Pam? Pam?,michael,2
41427,Pam?,dwight,1
41428,"Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.",pam,27
41430,Hi.,michael,1
41432,"Uh, because you've been on the Lam? Because the 'boring police' have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?",michael,22
41434,"Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!",michael,22
41435,Death to Toby!,dwight,3
41437,"You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?",michael,20
41440,Is it criminal?,andy,3
41442,Have we heard of it?,andy,5
41444,Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave?,dwight,18
41451,"Oh, Scranton Strangler! [all react]",andy,5
41453,That was the worst joke ever.,michael,6
41455,"Okay. Okay goodbye, goodbye.",michael,4
41457,What? What?,michael,2
41459,"Hold on, Holly's coming back here?",michael,6
41462,"That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?",michael,41
41465,"Holly's coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party.",michael,11
41467,"You know what, we'll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree.",michael,22
41468,Okay.,dwight,1
41469,Cancel. We're canceling it. [Michael starts to throw away all of the food],michael,13
41471,"No, we have to cancel the party.",michael,7
41473,"No, no, no, we're gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new.",michael,12
41474,I bought these.,andy,3
41475,I know.,michael,2
41476,These cookies are fine.,andy,4
41477,It's not. They're not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.,michael,13
41478,"Michael, Michael, wait we don't have, we don't have the budget for another party.",pam,14
41479,"Well then everybody'll chip in, it'll be fine.",michael,8
41480,"I honestly think you're idealizing people here again, Michael. I don't think that's gonna happen.",pam,15
41481,"You know what, I'll pay for it. I'll pay for the party. It doesn't matter. This is way too important. People, Holly's coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work.",michael,39
41482,"Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And, know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more person's breath away.",michael,51
41485,"Well, this year's gonna be different. We're gonna have fun. It's not gonna be tacky. It's going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It's not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It's gonna be cool, sleek Santa.",michael,55
41487,Okay. Sure.,michael,2
41489,You never know about the press.,michael,6
41491,Could he help us with some parking tickets?,michael,8
41493,"Well, then he's not a senator.",michael,6
41495,Okay.,michael,1
41496,Hey.,jim,1
41497,Hey.,pam,1
41498,"We still doing the gifts today? [Pam nods] I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.",jim,20
41499,"Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year.",pam,16
41500,Me neither. Whew.,jim,3
41501,Okay.,pam,1
41503,"[A note is on Jim's computer that says, 'It is time. Parking lot at noon.' Jim nods and hands it to Dwight who burns it.]",jim,25
41504,"Okay... [sighs] Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No, no!",michael,11
41505,"No, it has the little...",pam,5
41506,"Pam, no, no. Holly's coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks it's a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you.",michael,38
41508,"Yes, that's me. Come on it.",michael,6
41509,"[scats awkwardly] There's nothing classier than boring Jazz music. I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, what's better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?",michael,49
41510,"Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?",pam,14
41512,Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It's just us.,pam,20
41513,"I will help. Although my 'brid', my hybrid, my Prius hybrid, won't fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis.",andy,28
41515,"I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup.",andy,13
41516,"Oh, do you mean Darryl? That's a great idea. I'll ask him.",pam,12
41517,You know Darryl?,andy,3
41518,Yeah. He works here. We all know him.,pam,8
41519,"I should come along, just 'cause he's my, you know, he's my hookup.",andy,13
41520,Cool.,pam,1
41527,"It's cool, Darryl, I'm here too.",andy,6
41528,"Hey, sorry, I really didn't want to come in. It's just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we're hoping we could borrow your truck.",pam,29
41530,"Come on, it'll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back.",andy,16
41532,"Okay. Sorry. We'll uh, we'll leave you alone.",pam,8
41534,"When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her.",michael,13
41536,"She doesn't need an internet presence, you just know.",michael,9
41539,What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the courthouse.,michael,14
41546,"And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions.",michael,15

41557,"Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, [cell phone chimes] then... [reading text message] 'How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight.'",jim,34
41562,"There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God's sake?",michael,12
41564,Hello.,michael,1
41566,"[imitating her accent] Well, I never thought I'd see your face around these parts, you old bastard.",michael,17
41568,"[as Curly] Why, you're some sorta wise guy, huh?",michael,9
41570,"Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!",michael,4
41572,[as Homer] D'oh!,michael,3
41574,Okay... Holly's back.,jim,3
41575,Hi. Hi. Oh... [they hug],michael,5
41577,"Oh no, not the huggy monster! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! [both sigh] Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly.",michael,26
41581,That's adorable.,michael,2
41585,"Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party.",michael,10
41587,"Isn't it wonderful? We love it here. Don't you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk. [in a stereotyped Mexican accent] I show you to your desk.",michael,31
41589,What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?,michael,8
41590,Aww...,jim,1
41592,This is weird. I can't believe you're here. This feels like you never left. Doesn't it?,michael,16
41594,Oh...,michael,1
41596,"Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah! [the both chuckle] Oh, I love toy...",michael,14
41598,"Well, that's understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character?",michael,9
41600,You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy's mom.,michael,12
41602,"Because without Andy's mom, there's no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie.",michael,15
41604,You're kidding me. Ahh!,michael,4
41606,What a douche bag!,michael,4
41608,Get a... yeah! Good riddance.,michael,5
41610,Mmhmm.,michael,1
41612,Good for him.,michael,3
41614,Really? That's creepy. How did AJ get in your house?,michael,10
41616,"Oh, you do?",michael,3
41618,"[fighting back tears] Yeah, Randy Newman's the best.",michael,8
41620,Me too.,michael,2
41621,"[singing] Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Won't you be my Christmas tree.",andy,11
41622,"Hey, how about this one?",pam,5
41623,"Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?",andy,35
41624,Maybe. I mean...,pam,3
41626,"Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it's none of my business, but if I couldn't have Cece for Christmas, I'd be really upset too.",pam,22
41627,"I don't have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I'm going to kill myself.",andy,17
41629,"Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents.",pam,11
41631,"No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.",pam,24
41633,"Bring her to the party. Yeah, we'll have Santa, and we'll play games with her. It'll be a lot of fun.",pam,21
41634,Yes.,andy,1
41635,You'll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.,pam,10
41636,"Hey guys, the tree's here.",pam,5
41637,Hey.,michael,1
41638,"Nobody hug me, I'm covered in tree sap, so...",andy,9
41640,"Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I'm Santa Claus. Welcome.",michael,12
41642,It's a sophisticated take.,michael,4
41645,"Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled.",michael,20
41646,Who told you that?,pam,4
41647,"Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.",michael,8
41653,"Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?",pam,9
41655,"You guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.",pam,21
41659,"Wow, an ultimatum.",pam,3
41661,It doesn't really seem like you.,pam,6
41663,[turns in Pam's chair with a Pam wig on and laughs maniacally],dwight,12
41664,"Don't. Stop, Dwight! [Dwight pelts Jim with snowballs] Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!",jim,12
41665,"Oh, no. Oh, no!",dwight,4
41666,Stop!,jim,1
41667,"Oh, no. Yes, taste my wrath!",dwight,6
41668,Okay. Okay. Okay.,jim,3
41669,Huh? You like that?,dwight,4
41670,Seriously!,jim,1
41671,Huh?,dwight,1
41672,Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally],jim,9
41673,"Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.",dwight,26
41674,I just want it to stop.,jim,6
41675,"So, cool right?",pam,3
41677,Okay.,pam,1
41679,"Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?",pam,9
41681,"I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or...",pam,15
41683,No.,pam,1
41686,"Hey, Toby.",jim,2
41688,No way.,jim,2
41690,That's increadible.,jim,2
41692,You know what's crazy?,jim,4
41694,"I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. [he hurls a snowball at Dwight with a lacrosse stick, misses, and shatters a window, everyone gasps] Excuse me. [clears throat]",jim,32
41695,"I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don't. And that's just the way it is. And I can be mature about that. [clip of Michael throwing Holly's Woody in the trash and pouring coffee on it]",michael,48
41700,"What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic.",michael,43
41701,I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.,dwight,24
41702,What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me.,jim,10
41703,"With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.",dwight,14
41705,"All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? [he holds up a toy taxi cab] Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City.",michael,37
41706,"Wait, what girlfriend?",dwight,3
41707,I haven't told you about her.,michael,6
41708,I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.,dwight,13
41711,I do. She is.,michael,4
41712,Did you see her face? Well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael G. Scott. And it ain't Tara.,michael,33
41714,Yup.,pam,1
41716,"No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.",pam,15
41718,Look at this.,pam,3
41723,"What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting.",michael,21
41725,"Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn't that nice? Thank you very much.",michael,14
41727,It is Christmas.,michael,3
41729,"Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed.",michael,26
41730,Why would anyone frame you for that?,andy,7
41731,"Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole 'Woody came to life' thing so quickly?",jim,16
41732,"Ahhhhhh! [laughs] Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?",michael,12
41734,[laughs] I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids...,michael,17
41735,Yikes. [everyone gasps],jim,3
41737,Dear God in heaven.,dwight,4
41738,"All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings.",michael,24
41740,"Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought.",michael,20
41741,"Okay, hey, hey, hey...",dwight,4
41742,"No, fake girlfriends are always wrong.",jim,6
41744,"When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, 'Michael, I love you, but I can't do this.' But then, with this other guy, you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me.",michael,51
41746,And we did this whole stupid party for you.,michael,9
41751,"Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?",michael,16
41753,"[walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it, reading the note] 'Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese.' [opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him, everyone laughs] Damn it, Dwight!",jim,39
41754,"Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.",dwight,20
41761,"Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?",pam,37
41762,"Oh, my goodness.",pam,3
41763,I am the mean old grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges.,andy,23
41766,Wahhh...,andy,1
41767,"Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch?",pam,7
41768,No. You must answer topical political questions. How many congressmen is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?,andy,24
41770,Do you know the other state?,andy,6
41772,"The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out she's burning up because the star is right behind her ear! [pulls star from coat and pretends to find it behind Jada's ear]",andy,39
41795,Hey,michael,1
41797,"Nice to see you again, AJ. Welcome.",michael,7
41799,Good trip down?,michael,3
41801,"Good, good. Good to see you. Have fun. Enjoy the partay.",michael,11
41802,I am dead inside.,michael,4
41809,Thank you.,pam,2
41841,"[Jim hits a ceiling panel] I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe.",pam,13
41842,"Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright. [Jim hands Pam a present]",jim,16
41843,Is it... is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica? [she shakes it],pam,13
41844,"Ooh, go easy with the shaking.",jim,6
41845,"[lifting up a diamond bracelet] Oh, my God.",pam,8
41846,You like it?,jim,3
41847,I love it.,pam,3
41848,"Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that.",jim,12
41849,"Alright, my turn.",jim,3
41850,"Oh, um, it's just, I didn't, I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder.",pam,19
41851,"Right. Of course. [reading the comic book] 'The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert.' Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter.",jim,29
41852,I mean... [speechless],jim,3
41853,"Michael, wait!",pam,2
41854,"Oh, hey, hey, no, don't run. You're gonna slip.",michael,9
41855,That's good advice.,pam,3
41856,"Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.",michael,41
41857,That's a sad story.,pam,4
41858,"[voice breaking] Yeah, well, at least he was married.",michael,9
41859,"Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything's gonna be okay.",pam,9
41860,"No, it's not. It's not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay.",michael,19
41861,"I shouldn't tell you this, but... AJ won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over.",pam,31
41862,Really?,michael,1
41863,"Really. And I don't know about you, but I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?",pam,25
41864,No.,michael,1
41865,So just be patient.,pam,4
41866,"Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don't want you to fall.",michael,16
41867,I surrender.,jim,2
41868,I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent.,dwight,15
41869,Anything. You got it.,jim,4
41870,You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.,dwight,12
41871,You're a psychopath.,jim,3
41872,I'll take that as a no.,dwight,6
41873,"I was in the mall, and I saw that, and I thought it had your name written all over it.",michael,20
41875,"No, that's not... no, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you.",michael,17
41877,[hands Kelly a receipt from his wallet] From the mall. That...,michael,11
41879,"Well, that...",michael,2
41891,Hey.,michael,1
41893,Oh.,michael,1
41895,Thank you. A Hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much.,michael,20
41898,"Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn't he say that?",michael,26
41900,I think I know where he is.,michael,7
41902,Mmhmm.,michael,1
41904,Video games.,michael,2
41906,A DSi?,michael,2
41908,A horse.,michael,2
41910,"You, are you sure you don't want a pony? You want a real horse?",michael,14
41912,All right. You have to pick up after them.,michael,9
41913,"Hey, sorry. I'm ready.",pam,4
41914,I don't want to go.,jim,5
41915,"Oh... come on, bear man. Come on. [the lights flicker]",pam,10
41916,Have you ever seen 'em do that? [walk outside and the parking lot is covered with snowmen],jim,17

41936,Sounds good.,jim,2
41937,Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them.,dwight,15
41938,Smart.,jim,1
41939,And the rest was just [mumbles]stuff.,dwight,6
41941,Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.,dwight,8

42119,Cool! Here's a little 'way to go' gift from Sabre. [tosses Erin a Frisbee],pam,14
42123,Creed. I noticed you don't have a resolution on the board. What's yours?,pam,13
42125,How is it going?,pam,4
42127,"One of the hardest parts about making resolutions is keeping them. In fact, most resolutions are abandoned by February.",pam,19
42128,Or sooner.,michael,2
42129,Yeah.,pam,1
42130,That's not a joke.,michael,4
42131,"But that's okay. Because it's not about being perfect, it's about trying.  In fact, why don't we go around and confess some of the ways that we've fudged on some of our resolutions?",pam,34
42133,"Okay, well, my confession is that today I had a sip of coffee. But that's fine.",pam,16

42136,"Next year? Come-I mean, what is the point? What is the point of that? I made a resolution to floss, and I did it. 12:01, January first, BAM! Blood everywhere.",michael,30
42138,"What is wrong with you people? Can't you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothing's stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel!",michael,44
42140,You're just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what's going to be on your tombstone?  Loser.,michael,23

42172,"Holly, come on in. Thanks for coming. I thought there should be an HR rep here for this. So, Kevin and Creed, things got a little bit intense in the conference room.",michael,32
42174,"And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax.",michael,24
42176,It was insensitive and I am sorry.,michael,7
42178,"I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies... I... care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line.",michael,33
42180,You're right. And I hope that we can still be friends.,michael,11

42227,You can toss them.,michael,4
42228,My resolution? I never want to make Holly cry again. Unless it's from laughing too hard. Or making love too beautifully.,michael,21
42231,Look at where you're going to be doing the cartwheel. So look at where you're going to be placing your hands. So pick a spot.,michael,25
42233,You ready to do this?,michael,5
42235,You know what? I'm going to stay here as long as it takes.,michael,13
42237,It's about you. It's about you. Go!,michael,7

42276,Nein! I'm greek! My name is Mikanos.,michael,7
42278,Okay.,michael,1
42279,"I am the plant. Every great seminar has one. My job is to make the speaker look good, and I do this through the techniques of leading questions and laughing at all jokes. And the character 'Mikanos', is just a little added flava. 'Mikanos' is loosely based on another character I do, 'Spiros', who is more about the ladies.",michael,59
42280,Thank you so much Tuna Turner. You are simply the best.,andy,11

42287,I'm really sorry. I can't do it.,jim,7
42288,You can't. You can't.,andy,4
42289,"I can't have this go badly. I'm a terrible salesman, and I haven't been making very many sales lately, or ever. This is my only idea on how to turn things around. If it goes badly, I might lose my job, which would suck because this is the only job I've ever been good at.",andy,55
42290,Will you let me know when this whole seminar thing's over?,jim,11

42653,"Yeah, which one?",andy,3

42687,"No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought...",pam,23
42688,"Pam, this isn't a shopping trip.",dwight,6
42690,This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.,dwight,7

42709,Seriously?,pam,1
42717,Oh! Ok.,pam,2
42719,"Yeah, yeah. Put me on that.",andy,6
42722,"Hello. I would like a hot dog please. Now, I don't have any money so here is what I would like to do. I leave you here with my watch, and I come back later to pay for the hot dog.",michael,41
42724,Well I understand that but this is a $45 watch.,michael,10
42726,With that I can buy... half the menu.,michael,8
42728,All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you don't sell?,michael,14
42730,"Well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why don't you just throw one away now into my mouth?",michael,20
42732,Okay. You've just lost my business.,michael,6
42733,Hey.,dwight,1
42735,There's too many brands. Where's Holly?,dwight,6

42744,Tootenbacher.,dwight,1
42747,"Of course. He was here. She's the key. Amazing. Holly. Hey, where you would you like to go next? Holly?",dwight,20
42749,"Oh, boy. That was yummy. Thank you so much. You know what? I think I left my wallet in my car. Do you mind if I run out and get it?",michael,31
42751,Okay. I'll be right back. [goes to leave but walks back]. Okay. You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't have my wallet and I was gonna try to dine and dash and that was stupid and I realize I can't do that to you fine people.,michael,48
42753,"Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.",michael,24
42755,Well the number three is not such a giant feast.,michael,10
42757,"Okay, all right. You know what?",michael,6
42759,I am not. I just have had a bad day.  And I... okay. I'll be back later with the money. I'm just gonna leave right now.,michael,27

42796,"Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner.",pam,9
42804,"Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that's chirping to you, 'this way, this way'?",dwight,25
42806,"Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you!",dwight,28
42808,All right then. Someone propose a plan.,dwight,7
42810,"Not you, Erin.",dwight,3
42812,That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.,dwight,22
42815,"Right.  I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination.  Maybe he's bowling.",dwight,43
42817,Hi. [laughs] How did you know I was up here?,michael,10
42819,I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin.,michael,11
42821,Yeah. [laughs] Wow. I just miss you so much.,michael,9
42823,Really?,michael,1
42825,Can I kiss you?,michael,4

42838,Hey. How you doing?,pam,4
42840,Yeah.,pam,1
42842,"At least she lived a very long and I'm sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you.",pam,35
42844,It's possible that some people thought it was your birthday.,pam,10
42846,Birthday punches! [softly punching Darryl in the stomach] One two three four five sice seven eight!,andy,16
42847,I'm so sorry.,pam,3

42858,"Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye... bye.",michael,8
42860,Don't go. I don't want you to go. Oh don't go. Don't go.,michael,13
42861,"Holly and I are dating. It's been a week, and I still can't believe it. [sighs] It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can't work for it. It just comes to you.",michael,39
42874,[rubbing hands with Holly] Are these numbers correct?,michael,8
42876,Okay.,michael,1
42878,"Are you... are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? 'Cause you're grossing me out.",michael,17
42880,[getting out of a taxi] There you go. Thanks.,jim,9
42881,How much did you give him?,pam,6
42882,Big tip.,jim,2
42883,Wait. I don't have my scarf.,pam,6
42884,What?,jim,1
42885,I'm missing my scarf. Oh. [both laugh],pam,7
42886,We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing.,jim,31
42887,"[loudly] Yeah, lunch was wonderful!",pam,5
42888,Shh.,jim,1
42889,"Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there?",pam,18
42890,"Um, bottomless champagne.",jim,3
42891,"Yes. Never found that bottom, did we?",pam,7
42892,No.,jim,1
42894,What's up?,andy,2
42896,Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing.,andy,16
42898,"But if there is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably...",andy,12
42900,"Well, okay then.",andy,3
42902,At least until Stanley calms down.,andy,6
42904,D...d...d...d...don't look. I accidentally did his Sudoku. [Stanley glares at Andy],andy,11
42906,"[on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles]",jim,23
42907,"Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really. [clears throat]",dwight,38
42908,[goes to hand Dwight a valentines card] Wait.,jim,8
42909,You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine.,dwight,18
42910,"Aww, nuts. [laughs]",jim,3
42929,"She's neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl's cousin's party. We were the only two white people there.",andy,18
42931,"Hey, look at that. Done.",andy,5
42933,I wish you well on your quest.,andy,7
42935,"Aww, I mean...",andy,3
42937,Okay.,andy,1
42940,"Sit. Okay, just close your eyes. [massaging Holly's back]",michael,9
42942,"Oh, yeah.",michael,2
42946,[clears throat],michael,2
42948,"[sitting in Holly's lap] Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting?",michael,16
42950,Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on.,michael,8
42955,OOH! Boom! Face!,jim,3
42957,Yeah. What? Us?,pam,3
42959,Did it!,jim,2
42960,Yeah!,pam,1
42961,Love it. Keep it goin.,jim,5
42970,"What, are you talking about me and Holly?",michael,8
42971,Yeah!,pam,1
42977,Whispering and tickling have their place in business.,michael,8
42979,"I... Okay, yeah, that's pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it.",michael,20
42980,Michael. Confession: I have done PDA in the office.,dwight,9
42981,Thank you.,michael,2
42982,I've had intercourse in the office.,dwight,6
42983,All right.,michael,2
42984,As has Angela!,dwight,3
42986,As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. [Creed smiles and nods] As has Michael and as has Holly.,dwight,29
42990,Okay. Fine. No more PDA.,michael,5
42992,You win. But here's what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.,michael,23
42994,Anything goes.,michael,2
42996,"Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?",dwight,14
42997,"Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we're gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?",michael,20
42998,And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?,dwight,9
42999,Pro.,michael,1
43000,Yes!,dwight,1
43001,What? Problem solved.,michael,3
43002,"No, no, it's great. I love working at Dunder Mifflin, a division of Taliban enterprises.",michael,15
43003,"That's weird. I mean, that's weird to have sex in the office. That's where you work, right?",pam,17
43004,Mm-hmm.,jim,1
43005,"You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had sex there, except for you and him.",pam,19
43006,[snorts] Ew.,jim,2
43010,Whoa.,andy,1
43012,[softy] We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad.,andy,15
43014,I think he can hear us.,andy,6
43015,"[softly] That makes sense, 'cause I feel like I'd be able to hear us at this level.",andy,17
43017,Darryl is a jerk.,andy,4
43019,"No, I'm just testing if he can hear.",andy,8
43021,Oh. Okay.,andy,2
43024,The temp at night?,andy,4
43027,Pi...,andy,1
43029,Okay.,andy,1
43031,Right. Okay.,andy,2
43033,"Ah, the old 'leave behind.' Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it's working.",michael,14
43035,"Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don't... I don't sit on your lap because it's comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt.",michael,37
43037,"Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we'll stop.",michael,11
43039,Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet. And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart.,michael,19
43040,"Hey, you know why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine's Day.",michael,19
43042,I love you.,michael,3
43044,I love you-love you.,michael,4
43046,I am really disappointed in the office's policy on PDA at this moment. I love you. [shakes Holly's hand],michael,19
43048,"Yeah, whatever. No big deal. Just the hottest girl in the world loves me.",michael,14
43049,"Okay, Ryan's the temp. What does he do at night?",andy,10
43051,"Oh, or maybe not. [turns out the lights]",andy,8
43053,How romantic is this?,andy,4
43055,Right. Do you see a clue or...,andy,7
43057,"Oh, my gosh.",andy,3
43061,No time to chat.,andy,4
43063,"Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here.",jim,11
43065,"Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey.",pam,13
43067,"No, we weren't.",pam,3
43069,No.,pam,1
43070,Definitely not. That's disgusting.,jim,4
43072,"Hey, you don't have to...",jim,5
43073,That was so embarrassing. I'm gonna die.,pam,7
43074,That was really rough.,jim,4
43075,Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office.,pam,18
43076,"No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place.",jim,11
43077,"Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed.",pam,16
43078,And a shower.,jim,3
43079,"Hello, Holly.",michael,2
43081,"Here, shake. No!",michael,3
43083,"No, we can't.",michael,3
43085,"No touching. Ah, I'm trying not to touch you.",michael,9
43087,Oh.,michael,1
43089,"Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can't do that. We can't do this. Ohh.",michael,15
43091,I don't know what your body feels like 'cause I can't touch it.,michael,13
43094,Grab you here.,michael,3
43096,I will grab you here anyway. [laughs],michael,7
43099,Never.,michael,1
43101,"I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can't stop. You don't what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained.",michael,42
43105,"Yes, it was that. It's that one.",michael,7
43108,We're not supposed to PDA.,michael,5
43110,I haven't thought about you having to go back to Nashua.,michael,11
43112,That's what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How's this gonna be any different?,michael,19
43114,I was in love with you.,michael,6
43116,"[chuckles, sighs]",michael,2
43119,Hey.,andy,1
43124,Hey. Hey. Come on. You're hurting him.,dwight,7
43125,It's like a time bomb...,michael,5
43126,Shh.,dwight,1
43127,"...is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging.",michael,13
43128,Just hush.,dwight,2
43129,Sexual time bomb.,michael,3
43130,Just rock. Shh.,dwight,3
43131,[into recorder] Boner Bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera.,michael,19
43132,Movie idea?,dwight,2
43133,No. [into recorder] Saving the world has never been this hard.,michael,11
43134,Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap.,dwight,16
43135,"No, I can't talk to her. I can't even look at her without thinking about it ending.",michael,17
43136,Kevin! Do more stupid faces.,dwight,5
43138,I don't know.,dwight,3
43139,Do the monkey face.,michael,4
43140,Do the monkey face!,dwight,4
43141,I love that. I love that face.,michael,7
43142,Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down.,dwight,10
43143,No. The monkey!,michael,3
43144,Go back to the monkey!,dwight,5
43145,Don't do the squirrel. Throw your poop.,michael,7
43146,Hurl your feces.,dwight,3
43147,That's good.,michael,2
43148,Good.,dwight,1
43149,That's good. He's throwing it.,michael,5
43150,They really do that.,dwight,4
43151,I know.,michael,2
43153,B-9.,andy,1
43155,"Maybe it's just more like, 'be mine.'",andy,7
43157,Mm.,andy,1
43159,Hmm. [points to Gabe blowing a kiss to Erin],andy,9
43160,Holly. Hey.,michael,2
43162,"Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think we need to break up.",michael,16
43164,"Actually, it's Valentine's Day. Shouldn't be doing this today. I'll talk to you tomorrow.",michael,14
43166,"You're gonna go back to Nashua eventually, and I can't handle it. So let's just...let's...",michael,15
43168,Who?,michael,1
43170,Okay. Okay.,michael,2
43171,"Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving into together. Yay! [claps] Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend!",michael,49
43174,"Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentine's Day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu.",michael,56
43176,I do.,michael,2
43180,What?,jim,1
43181,No.,pam,1
43182,No. We took a walk.,jim,5
43183,We took a walk.,pam,4
43184,"My perfect Valentine's Day? I'm at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago.",dwight,35
43188,What are our plans for tonight? Umm...,michael,7
43190,"After three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of re-shooting and two years of editing, I have finally completed my movie, Threat Level: Midnight.",michael,27
43191,Erin... what are you doing?,michael,5
43193,"That's... That's. Well, don't put words in my mouth.",michael,9
43194,Threat Level: Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.,jim,11
43195,"We're all in it, from like years and years ago. It's like a home movie.",pam,15
43196,"Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!",jim,8
43197,"Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn't go well. We thought it was a comedy. [flashback clip of Michael angrily leaving the conference room while the whole office is laughing at the tv] Everything pointed to it being a comedy.",pam,46
43198,We'd love to see it!,pam,5
43199,"Sweet, I will go invite Holly.",michael,6
43200,"Okay everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let's stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day! Okay?",pam,43
43203,"Mhmm! It's got action, it's got heart, it's got some bosom.",michael,11
43205,It's got a lot of me.,michael,6
43207,"Ladies and gentleman, Threat Level: Midnight. [applause]",michael,7
43208,"I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice- [robot impression] to be like this! [normally] But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.",dwight,35
43209,Dwight does not play a robot.,michael,6
43211,I did not love the dialogue. Or the character.  I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.,jim,22
43212,He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?,dwight,19
43214,"By far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie. But, it was integral to the story.",michael,18
43215,That was not scripted.,michael,4
43217,"[cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.",jim,28
43218,"[turns off the movie from the remote, the office complains]",michael,10
43219,"I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.",jim,21
43224,"[to Holly] Well that's a... pretty good reaction. [Holly nods] Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?",michael,21
43226,"Okay. [Stands up and leaves the conference room to the dismay of the office] No, it's not good enough. It's not good enough...",michael,23
43227,Some people are really popping on screen!,andy,7
43228,Hey.,michael,1
43230,"Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great!",michael,8
43232,Did you? What did you love about it?,michael,8
43234,"No, no. Holly, this isn't Ocean's Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out. What'd you really think, honestly.",michael,32
43236,"Is it, is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded.",michael,23
43238,"[angrily] It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream.",michael,32
43240,"I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus.",michael,28
43242,"Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing.",michael,13
43244,"I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.",michael,47
43246,"Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass. And I'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great! And I'm sorry I called you a pain in the ass, I'm angry, and I love you.",michael,38
43249,Who likes Threat Level: Midnight? [applause from the office] Okay then who wants to watch the rest?! [everyone yells approval],michael,20
43250,"We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states.",michael,16
43251,"[he office shushes Michael to hear the movie better] That's fine, it's great!",jim,13
43252,"No, no! Actually it's really screwed up because they [chuckles], they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. That's why there were so many people there. [Michael stands up, clearly realizing that his movie is not as great as he thought]",michael,49
43253,Hey...,michael,1
43255,"No it's not. [kisses Holly while smiling] It's not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it.",michael,17
43256,[laughs at the stupidity],michael,4
43257,"Oh yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot.",michael,11
43258,[the office cheers] Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn't the president evil?,andy,10
43259,Oh yeah! [laughs] Yes he is!,michael,6
43260,"No no, he's doing it to catch the president!",dwight,9
43261,"No, no Dwight. He's just being stupid. [the office laughs]",michael,10
43262,I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals.,dwight,36
43264,They're still good for another week.,dwight,6
43268,"Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.",jim,10
43269,"No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.",dwight,46
43270,Three months.,jim,2
43271,Could be.,dwight,2
43272,Four months.,jim,2
43273,"I can see that happening, yes.",dwight,6
43274,Eight months?,jim,2
43275,That's a realistic time line.,dwight,5
43276,[Pam kisses Jim on the cheek] Eleven months.,jim,8
43277,Perhaps.,dwight,1
43278,Okay now really think hard about this one:  One year.,jim,11
43279,I can see that as a very real possibility.,dwight,9
43280,"[time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months?",jim,17
43281,I can see that happening.,dwight,5
43282,Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That's just...,jim,7
43284,Still not seeing the problem here.,michael,6
43286,"It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look who's here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly.",michael,32
43288,Hi. [Holly and Michael kiss],michael,5
43293,"Oh, Michael! This'll be just us.",michael,6
43294,"Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him five shots.",michael,19
43296,And it also helps if you've had five shots.,michael,9
43298,Whoa!,michael,1
43299,[to Michael] Why is Packer back?,jim,6
43300,Is Packer here?,michael,3
43301,Why's he talking to Holly?,dwight,5
43302,"[peering into conference room] Don't know, don't care.",michael,8
43307,What!?,jim,1
43310,"You did! You got burned, because Packer's back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.",michael,39
43311,"[seething] Holly, you approved this?",dwight,5
43313,You did approve it?,jim,4
43320,"I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one! [laughs sheepishly] Right?",pam,34
43322,"Awwh, you're welcome. [they hug] My pleasure.",pam,7
43323,"[Pam walks over to him and smiles excitedly while bouncing, Jim imitates her] Can I do something for ya?",jim,19
43324,I just helped someone out. It feels good.,pam,8
43325,"Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...",jim,17
43326,So you know the feeling.,pam,5
43327,Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute.,michael,6
43328,I didn't order anything.,dwight,4
43329,And I don't have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we can't just sit around and wait for Creed to die.,michael,37
43330,Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.,dwight,9
43331,"So you wouldn't mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here. [Jim looks appalled]",michael,17
43333,"I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.",dwight,9
43335,No it is not.,dwight,4
43337,[Grunting as he crawls under Dwight's desk. Dwight follows] Let's look at this.,michael,13
43339,I don't wanna move desks!,dwight,5
43340,Don't be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! [Todd starts humping Dwight and Michael who are still under the desk.,michael,28
43341,Do I have any say in this?!,jim,7
43342,No!,michael,1
43344,"[in the annex, moving into his new desk. Holds up a red tray with rocks on it] Hey, who's dirt box is this?",dwight,23
43346,"What do you grow in here, bullcrap? [puts the tray into the garbage]",dwight,13
43347,"[walking into the annex with Jim] Hey, um...",pam,8
43350,"Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?",jim,11
43352,He's seriously awful!,pam,3
43355,[Pam starts nodding in agreement] Why are you nodding?,jim,9
43356,United front...,pam,2
43362,"Well, I mean he humped Michael.",jim,6
43366,Where did you get this?!,andy,5
43368,"This is a sick computer! Gwen Stefani has this computer! [to Pam, in a fake British accent] Uhhh, Pamela! What does a guy have to do to get, ahem, one of them?",andy,32
43369,You have a computer Andy.,pam,5
43370,"Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become world famous as the slowest computer in Africa. So...",andy,21
43371,"Ok, but listen. We just don't have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.",pam,20
43372,"Well Andy's desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it's just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but...",andy,19
43373,"Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.",pam,32
43375,"I'm not asking for one, I need it.",andy,8
43377,"Phyllis, no body is handing anything out.",andy,7
43378,"See, this is what I'm talking about.",pam,7
43379,What are you gonna play mange on faster?,andy,8
43380,Sorry Andy.,pam,2
43391,"Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer.",dwight,12
43392,"[walking through the office, notices Andy with Erin's computer set up at his desk] What the heck! Why do you have Erin's computer!",pam,23
43393,"It's crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched.",andy,13
43394,What? Erin is that true?,pam,5
43396,"Erin, it's not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? It's not yours to give away.",pam,18
43397,"Pam, when I'm freaking out, I just sorta step back and-",andy,11
43398,"I'm not freaking out, Andy.",pam,5
43399,"-take a few breaths, and then I ask myself: Is this worth freaking out about?",andy,15
43400,"Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?",pam,8
43401,That's interesting. So you also think my computer is crappy.,andy,10
43402,Switch the computers back Andy.,pam,5
43403,Seriously?,andy,1
43404,Seriously.,pam,1
43405,Pam! Come on!,andy,3
43406,Now please.,pam,2
43407,Fine! [the office goes back to their work] Please make sure no one is humping me!,andy,16

43413,Please.,michael,1
43415,"Yeah, You love him right? [Holly seems unsure] You love him. I can tell.",michael,14
43417,"No. Not me, him.",michael,4
43421,"Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he's funnier than you? Oh honey...",michael,16
43423,He's funnier than me.,michael,4
43425,So I'm less funny than not funny at all?,michael,9
43428,[seems taken aback] Uhm...,michael,4
43430,That's insane!,michael,2
43434,Yeah.,jim,1
43436,[continues working],jim,2
43437,"[walks towards Todd] Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.",dwight,11
43439,Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.,dwight,32
43440,That's a lot of reasons! [suspicious],jim,6
43441,Drink it!,dwight,2
43443,[interrupts Dwight trying to force feed Todd] Can I talk to you a second?,jim,14
43444,"So, this hot chocolate thing.",jim,5
43445,None of your business.,dwight,4
43446,"Well, you know you can't actually poison him.",jim,8
43447,"It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.",dwight,27
43448,I really think we should join forces on this one.,jim,10
43449,Really.,dwight,1
43450,"What do we think, what would drive him crazy.",jim,9
43451,I know.,dwight,2
43452,Here we go.,jim,3
43453,"Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate.",dwight,5
43454,"You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.",jim,36
43455,[mocking] Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?,dwight,27
43456,"Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.",jim,39
43457,Who is Justice Beaver?,dwight,4
43458,He... It's a crime fighting beaver.,jim,6
43459,Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?,dwight,18
43460,"Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred.",jim,6
43461,"Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I'll read it over.",dwight,25
43462,Pam. Can I talk to you in private?,andy,8
43463,I don't know if there's really a private place in this office.,pam,12
43464,Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago.,andy,29
43465,[looking confused] You did that?,pam,5
43466,Can we talk about this in the meeting? Because we're a little late.,andy,13
43467,Okay. [walks to conference room with Andy and stares at the sign up sheet with wonder] When did people sign-,pam,20
43468,"Mind if I close the door? [after shutting door in the conference room] What you did out there, earlier, was totally un-cool.",andy,22
43469,"Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?",pam,13
43470,You humiliated me in front of every body!,andy,8
43471,"Okay, well I didn't think about it like that. It's just, I can't do anything about it. I can't replace that one unless that computer breaks.",pam,26
43472,"I mean, it's pretty broken already.",andy,6
43473,"Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.",pam,15
43474,[looks at her knowingly] Pretty sneaky sis. [knocking on conference room door],andy,12
43476,"[to Jim, the two are alone in the annex] There are over four hundred of these! [indicating a packet of paper]",dwight,21
43477,Yeah I couldn't cut it down.,jim,6
43478,"They're all good. So good! Number three: eat a frog. That sounds promising. Number four: eat a dog. I don't know, um, from practical stand point-",dwight,26
43479,One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?,jim,7
43480,"Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen. [Dwight tries to open up a drawer on his desk but it only goes out two inches] Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.",dwight,48
43483,"And you made Hank smile, that doesn't happen often. You're very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter. [Hank looks irritated again]",michael,30
43485,"I don't know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin.",michael,19
43487,Yeah.,michael,1
43489,I guess you said something weird about your daughter?,michael,9
43491,"You've been on the road a long time. And you've been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can't be peeing all over the walls.",michael,32
43493,No it isn't.,michael,3
43495,"Yeah, a little bit.",michael,4
43497,I won't.,michael,2
43498,"[Michael and Todd are walking into the office] Okay, every body. I need you to see this. Because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you. Todd Packer, is going to apologize. Kevin! Front and center, come here.",michael,43
43500,"Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.",michael,19
43502,"Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn't be apologizing to Packer. That doesn't make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.",michael,26
43505,"Kevin, do you accept the apology?",michael,6
43507,"Okay, go back to the annex.",michael,6
43512,"That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy. [Andy looks confused and shrugs] Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-",michael,40
43514,"I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we're through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!",michael,37
43515,"[in a car with Andy, by the dumpster you can see a new computer box] So listen, we have to really scuff this up.",pam,24
43516,"No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I'm gonna make myself cry.",andy,47
43517,"Andy, this is the deal we made.",pam,7
43518,[watching Pam scrap his computer] That's probably good. That's enough.,andy,10
43519,We should break this hinge maybe.,pam,6
43520,Let's not go crazy.,andy,4
43522,"[using fake Southern accent, on the phone with Todd Packer, Dwight is also with Jim] Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. [Michael walks in on Jim and Dwight]",jim,59
43524,"It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!",jim,17
43525,[also In southern accent] And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.,dwight,19
43526,[trying to stop him] Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!,jim,16
43527,Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!,dwight,8
43529,Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and we'll get ya' back!,dwight,18
43530,What are you doing?,michael,4
43531,"[trying to hide from Michael what they're doing, he picks up the phone and talks directly into it] All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! [hangs up]",jim,38
43532,"I cannot believe this, you're sending Packer to Florida? Why?",michael,10
43533,He's a jerk.,jim,3
43534,He took my desk.,dwight,4
43535,"Okay, so you're tricking him into flying to Florida?",michael,9
43536,"It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.",dwight,11
43537,You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.,michael,13
43538,"No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing.",dwight,16
43539,"He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him.",michael,11
43540,Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about? [Michael leaves],jim,15
43541,"[plugging in new computer, acting to make people think he got a bad computer] Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?",andy,26
43542,Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!,pam,20
43543,"Where'd you even find this thing, like, in the corner in the warehouse?",andy,13
43544,"Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse. [Darryl gives the camera an odd look]",pam,20
43545,"All right, well thank you for my garbage computer. [Andy turns it on and looks amazed, clearly happy with it]",andy,20
43547,"Yes, about that.",michael,3
43549,Well... I don't know if that's a good idea.,michael,9
43551,"No, nothing like that at all.",michael,6
43553,Sorry?,michael,1

43698,[pulls away beans] I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.,jim,12
43699,"just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?",dwight,11
43700,"They're legumes Dwight, and you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now. [crumples up beans, stomps on them, and throws them in a box]",jim,33
43701,Hey Michael everyone's in the conference room.,pam,7
43702,Why?,michael,1
43703,You called the meeting I don't..,pam,6
43704,I did?,michael,2
43705,Ok. Thank you all for coming. I would like to talk to you all today about... recycling.,michael,17
43706,Michael.,pam,1
43707,Yes.,michael,1
43708,We are a family.,pam,4
43709,I could not have agreed with you more.,michael,8
43710,"And I've always believed that we should all be involved in everyone's personal lives, in a very major way.",pam,19
43711,Yes. Thank you.,michael,3
43712,So about this proposal thing...,pam,5
43713,"No, no, no, no. My minds made up I am not going to change my mind you can't talk me out of it.",michael,23
43714,"Michael, she's perfect for you.",pam,5
43716,She's amazing. This is very exciting.,jim,6
43717,So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable.,pam,20
43718,I had a great idea until you ruined it.,michael,9
43720,"[playing the Dallas board game] Hmm, I'm gonna play me a little ol' black mail card .",andy,17
43722,And call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all.,andy,16
43724,Why not. Seems to me we're just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being.,andy,28
43726,Oooh.,andy,1
43730,Well played.,andy,2
43732,We must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot.,andy,14
43734,Well that's Dallas.,andy,3
43745,Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?,pam,22
43747,"How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' I lost my head when I fell in love with you.'",michael,40
43748,That's a guarantee.,jim,3
43749,"It's easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.",michael,19
43750,Don't think you need the corpse then.,jim,7
43751,Heres the ring.,michael,3
43752,Holy s*** is that real?,pam,5
43753,Yeah. I saved 3 years salary.,michael,6
43755,Is she not going to like that?,michael,7
43756,No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.,pam,48
43758,At a gas station. [oscar laughs],jim,6
43759,At a gas station?,michael,4
43760,Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.,jim,18
43761,That mush have been a surprise when... at the gas station you proposed.,michael,13
43762,No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..,pam,12
43763,Oh yea you didn't say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.,michael,27
43764,Totally reasonable.,jim,2
43765,I just... it's terrifying.,michael,4
43766,She's not gonna say no.,pam,5
43767,I know but I'm still scared I don't know why.,michael,10
43768,Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.,jim,19
43769,You were scared?,pam,3
43770,Yeah... it.s scary.,jim,3
43771,Get this... Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for 200 dollars and I told him 'Dude this was a prop in my movie.',michael,25
43773,"Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything.",michael,27
43775,Oh ok. For how long?,michael,5
43777,Is he alright?,michael,3
43779,You ok?,michael,2
43781,"Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that.",michael,9
43783,Ok.,michael,1
43785,"No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope.",michael,10
43787,No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance.,michael,34
43789,"You cant go, you're dead, I shot you 5 moves ago.",andy,11
43797,Not bad right. [swinging golf club],jim,6
43799,[to Dwight] Nice.,jim,3
43800,I know right...[sees Jim's beans] what the?,dwight,7
43801,Oh my God.,jim,3
43802,That... that's impossible.,dwight,3
43803,"It is right. I mean, it's impossible.",jim,7
43804,"All right, I'll take them.",dwight,5
43805,They're probably worthless.,jim,3
43806,Probably. [walks away with beans],dwight,5
43807,Leave the telescope.,jim,3
43808,"I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans.  So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.",dwight,50
43809,"Hey, how'd we do?",michael,4
43811,That's great and we still have most of our stuff. Good.,michael,11
43813,"No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that.",michael,9
43815,Shhhh. Let's go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff.,michael,16
43816,So this is one of my favorite places in the world.,michael,11
43818,This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Let's go in here.,michael,29
43819,This is where we first kissed.,michael,6
43821,And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?,michael,13
43825,In-grown hair.,michael,2
43826,"Right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness?",michael,14
43828,We saved a lot of lives that day. That's where you first met Michael Klump.,michael,15
43830,"And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it, you thought it was so wrong.",michael,42
43831,And over here..,michael,3
43833,"Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do. [runs water through hand]",michael,31
43835,Let's go in here.,michael,4
43837,"This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.",michael,21
43838,"Holly, will you marry me?",jim,5
43842,That guy's got more than he can handle as it is.,michael,11
43845,That marriage would be a sham.,michael,6
43848,Easy no.,michael,2
43851,That would be hot. I would pay to see that.,michael,10
43854,Only one that I was kind of worried about.,michael,9
43855,"[the area where Holly's desk is is filled with lit candles] This is where I fell in love with you. And this is where I ask you to marry me. It started with.. [fire sprinklers go on] Holly Flax, marrying me will you be?",michael,44
43858,Congratulations!,pam,1
43859,Congratulations!,jim,1
43860,"Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. We're moving to Colorado.",michael,10
43862,Yep.,michael,1
43863,"Wait, what?",jim,2
43864,Holly has to go back to Colorado. I'm going with her. I'm leaving.,michael,13
43865,"Kahlua Sombrero, please.",michael,3
43867,"Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I'm a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years.",michael,17
43869,"Oh, really?",michael,2
43871,"And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms.",michael,9
43873,Do not tell my fiance I'm drinking on a Wednesday.,michael,10
43875,"I'm moving out to the burbs... actually, I'm moving further than the burbs, I'm moving to Colorado.",michael,17
43877,Yep. Don't mess with Colorado.,michael,5
43879,"No, no. I don't want to end up like Sunny Bobo.",michael,11
43881,"You know, I would like to try the luge, through.",michael,10
43883,That's what I've heard.,michael,4
43885,Oh yeah? Me too. Summer or winter?,michael,7
43889,Really? What happened?,michael,3
43891,Oh... wow. The mountains. Where things are.,michael,7
43893,"Man, he is late. I'm gonna call him. Do you mind? I'm sorry. [calls Deangelo, Deangelo's phone vibrates]",michael,18
43895,"No, I'm here. I'm right... I'm at the bar.",michael,9
43897,You are? What bar?,michael,4
43899,I... do not see you.,michael,5
43901,"I'm been here about... gosh, over half an hour.",michael,9
43904,What're you wearing?,michael,3
43906,Are we both at the right place?,michael,7
43908,I hear your voice.,michael,4
43910,"I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man! [holds out hand] Michael Scott.",michael,14
43912,Wow... that is insane! [laughter],michael,5
43914,[entering Dunder Mifflin offices] Here we go! Are you ready?,michael,10
43916,Alright! Here we go!,michael,4
43917,This is it. What do you think?,michael,7
43920,"[pops up from below camera, and runs out of room]",michael,10
43924,"Ok, everyone, as you know, one of my favorite things is fanfare for it's own sake. So, without further ado, let's start clapping! Presenting Deangelo Vickers!",michael,26
43926,Come on out!,michael,3
43928,"I am well, sir, how are you?",michael,7
43930,Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.,dwight,30
43940,"And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it's Deangelo the whole time!",michael,14
43943,"I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!",michael,31
43945,Oh yeah... I know... that's what I was just saying... that's what...,michael,12
43947,"That exact situation is why I always carry around some of these. [holds up 'Hello, my name is..,'] nametags. Just in case. Because sometimes you just need to I.D. yourself.",andy,30
43949,"I wasn't even trying to make a joke. But I guess I've always been sorta quirky, offbeat, a little twisted.",andy,20
43950,"This is Jim and Pam, aka Jap. What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.",michael,20
43951,"Well, it wasn't an affair.",pam,5
43952,Yes it was.,michael,3
43953,"But, no, but we are a family.",pam,7
43954,[points to picture of Cecelia] We made that.,jim,8
43955,Cecelia.,pam,1
43957,"Really? Oh, my gosh! We just have the one, but she poops for four. [laughs]",pam,15
43958,Uh oh. Someone started off on the right foot with the new boss!,pam,13
43959,"Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.",jim,14
43960,Thanks for meeting me.,dwight,4
43961,Are you kidding? I'd come anywhere to see a turtle? Where'd you find him.,michael,14
43962,"There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.",dwight,11
43963,"You know me very well, Dwight.",michael,6
43964,"That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael, but I can't do it again. I can't do it again for a whole new guy.",dwight,23
43965,Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I'll be off all day.,michael,17
43966,"I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. What's wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.",dwight,28
43970,So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? I call the middle!,michael,15
43987,I sorta like the old way.,michael,6
43989,"I know, I know, I'm sorry, but if it's not a big deal we should just-",michael,16
43991,Is that good?,michael,3
43994,"Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work.",michael,7
43997,You can do the old way or whatever you think would work. [phone rings],michael,14
44001,Here we go... ok... what do African Americans call... [laughter],andy,10
44005,I... don't know. Help me.,andy,5

44011,"And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go. [Erin puts too much shaving cream on Michael's face, none on the neck]",michael,28
44013,"It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice.",michael,13
44016,"Well, we don't really do rap sessions. We kinda do... [Erin shaves Michael] god... we sorta do more of like powwows or-",michael,22
44018,That's-,michael,1
44019,"Hey, Deangelo, my mom just sent me this picture of Cece, it is so adorable.",pam,15

44021,Da-das.,pam,1
44022,And what happens here is-,jim,5
44024,We were... I think she was just trying to-,jim,9
44026,"You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can't say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something.",michael,24
44028,"Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don't even really have to worry about.",michael,31
44030,Don't shave my lips.,michael,4
44032,"I don't mean to go into a rant here, but...",andy,10
44033,"I wrote the perfect joke. Topical, edgy, funny.",andy,8
44034,"...I saw this thing on the news. Democrats want electric cars. Republicans don't. I'm thinking, 'how crazy is it that we have a car debate going on in a city known for gridlock.",andy,33
44036,[leans on table] I wasn't taking a position. It's just one of those things where- [table collapses under Andy],andy,19
44038,"Yeah, right, I mean- [walks into door, jokingly]",andy,8

44046,"I still have to look at this stuff, guys.",michael,9
44050,"Deangelo's great. I love the guy. But I'm not sure he's a great fit for the office. And also, I'm not sure if I love the guy.",michael,27
44056,"[mimes using a rope to pull himself forward to microwave] Let's see if they have my favorite teas in here... [throws tea packets into air, puts hand in unplugged toaster, pretends to be shocked, takes container of cheese-puffs and throws them into air, pours hot coffee on his pants]",andy,49

44063,I left a message at corporate.,dwight,6
44065,Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file?,dwight,11
44067,From when he recommended me to replace him.,dwight,8
44070,[interrupting Deangelo] Snack time! It's the witching hour! It's the sandwitching hour!,michael,12
44073,"PB and J, my mom's recipe! [throws sandwitch at Phyllis]",michael,10

44083,"Oscar, here you go. [throws sandwitch]",michael,6
44085,No one had a problem with the air here until you came around.,michael,13
44087,"No, that's good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in. [disgusted comments by co-workers] No body go in there. Stay where you are.",michael,31
44089,"No, it's not insane, Oscar. I'm been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you're gonna throw it all away? No.",michael,27
44090,"Listen, you're the one who decided to leave. Come on, he's the new boss, you know we have to do this.",jim,21
44091,"Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight.",michael,11
44092,"Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room.",dwight,7
44094,"I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, you'll be fine.",michael,28

44147,You are getting so funny! [Erin giggles] Very good.,michael,9
44148,"The Dundies are my baby, and they need to go on. When Larry King died they didn't just cancel his show. They got Pierce Morgan to come in, and do his show, and, that way, Larry lives on.",michael,38

44161,"Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybody's right. They're like breadsticks on steroids. Right?",michael,12
44163,"So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host. [Dwight looks suspecting] And that person is [he and DeAngelo roll their tongues as a drum roll] DeAngelo! [all applaud]",michael,48

44175,"[cutting him off] Okay, okay. You know what, I didn't actually lose my keys...",michael,14
44177,Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it's all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay. [Ryan stands next to Michael up front] Ryan how are you today?,michael,43

44183,"Thanks, yeah.",jim,2
44185,No! God! [Jim looks at him oddly],michael,7
44187,Why don't you think of hosting the Dundies like you're just running a meeting.,andy,14
44188,"No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!",michael,10
44189,"Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.",jim,15
44190,"Jim, please no loopholes.",michael,4
44192,"This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?",michael,19

44216,I think I'm gonna go.,jim,5
44217,What?,pam,1
44218,I think you got this. Kay? [Erin nods] Alright. Feel better!,jim,11
44220,"I'm sorry, that just wasn't interesting to me.",jim,8

44311,"Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!",pam,11
44312,What?,michael,1

44815,What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine?  How can you keep defending him?,pam,19
44816,He's good at his job.  And I like working for him.,jim,12

44820,How could I not see it?  You're so right.,andy,10
44821,[to Jim] Why don't you talk to him about it?,pam,10

44823,Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?,pam,18
44824,Mmm-hmm.,jim,1
44825,"And if he doesn't listen, then he can kiss his penis goodbye.  Snip snip.  Am I right, girls?",andy,20

44834,"I know. [Gabe and Darryl stand on either side of Jim with paper and pens in hand]  Just the guys.  Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem.  I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads.  Uh, some of the female department heads.",jim,53

There's a consensus, people are happy.",jim,57

45006,Yeah?,andy,1
45008,Sure. What's going on? [in room with Gabe],andy,8

45022,"Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.",dwight,11
45023,"And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.  [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]",jim,39

45042,"Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.",jim,9

45044,And the desk.,jim,3
45045,"The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business.",dwight,27
45046,Okay.,jim,1
45047,Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.,dwight,30
45048,"I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...",jim,19
45049,Don't make me fire you.,dwight,5
45050,You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.,jim,16
45051,Don't make me pre-fire you.,dwight,5
45052,You wouldn't dare.,jim,3
45053,"Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired.",dwight,12
45054,"[quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.",jim,16
45055,What?,dwight,1
45056,"If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, 'Well that's pretty premature to think,' but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.",jim,42
45057,"How you doing, Jordan?",dwight,4
45059,"Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly.",dwight,37
45061,"Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou-[Dwight opens a box and sits down in shock] Ohh... it's a holster.",dwight,33

45063,"Dwight, are you carrying a gun?",pam,6
45064,"The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me.",dwight,22
45065,"Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable.",andy,6
45066,"The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster.",dwight,18
45067,Why do you need to wear the holster at all?,pam,10
45068,Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?,dwight,13
45071,Uh... hello! [indicates his phone clipped onto his belt],dwight,9
45073,Why would I put a banana in my holster?,dwight,9
45075,"Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo.",pam,9
45076,"Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah! [Dwight goes to flip the gun and it fires near Andy's ear, making everyone jump]",dwight,35
45078,Aah! Aah! It's so loud!,andy,5
45080,[trying to find a pitch] Eeeeeeee... There's like this crazy ringing going on. I can't - eeeeeee... I can't find perfect C.,andy,22
45084,"No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun.",dwight,38
45085,[scatting off-key] Something's definitely wrong.,andy,5
45090,"Okay, why are you calling Jo?",dwight,6
45091,I think I should go the hospital.,andy,7
45095,"Thank you, Darryl. [Andy limps out of his chair and leans on Darryl for support]",andy,15

45105,Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?,dwight,17
45107,I have no way of knowing if that's true.,dwight,9
45109,"Okay, really?",dwight,2
45112,Come on.,dwight,2
45114,"I just really, really think we should handle this internally.",dwight,10

45118,"There he is! Our hero! [Both Dwight and Erin move to hug Andy] You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.",dwight,25
45119,"Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.",andy,13
45120,Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.,dwight,18
45121,Yeah.,andy,1
45123,Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.,andy,24
45126,American Idol? What? No.,dwight,4
45128,No.,dwight,1
45130,"Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition.",dwight,9
45134,I put everything back in the vending machine.,dwight,8

45139,Thank God.,dwight,2

45141,What's jazz hands?,dwight,3
45142,[quickly shakes his hands back and forth],jim,7
45143,Fine.,dwight,1

45149,"Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?",jim,22
45151,"[does jazz hands, Jo notices and eyes him oddly] Well, what can you do? Life.",dwight,15
45152,We have to clean this up now!,andy,7
45157,No! [Erin and Andy laugh],andy,5
45159,Uh...,andy,1
45161,"Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying...",andy,13
45163,And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary.,andy,31

45178,"Okay, how's that?",dwight,3
45180,I'm kneading it!,dwight,3
45183,Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.,dwight,10
45185,"I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -",dwight,53
45187,"It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps.",dwight,7
45189,I take full responsibility.,dwight,4

45206,Shut up.,dwight,2
45207,"Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time.

45226,He never called a meeting.,jim,5
45228,What are we doing?,pam,4
45232,We need a new manager.,pam,5
45233,[conducting interview] Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?,jim,20
45235,Really?,jim,1
45237,[waiting for Fred to continue] ...What is it?,jim,8
45244,You could just be saying it to get the job.,jim,10

45248,Okay.,jim,1
45250,Did you just trademark that...,jim,5
45261,[puts up a poster in the break room with 'IF YOU ARE ON THE SEARCH COMMITTEE PLEASE CONSIDER ANDY' on it in bold lettering],andy,24
45263,"The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.",andy,35

45267,EEEHHH!! No. Hehe.,andy,3
45268,"In my family, you don't really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don't know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and... [awkwardly smiling] we'll see what Rosa comes back with.",andy,59
45278,"[to Dwight, who is reading the want ads] Should you really be so blatant about that?",pam,16
45279,"They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.",dwight,29
45280,Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?,pam,11
45281,Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.,dwight,14
45283,"Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.",jim,7
45285,Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.,jim,11
45297,"Can you... [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?",jim,35
45299,Yes.,jim,1
45301,Yes.,jim,1
45303,"[Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves] He creeps me out. [Toby nods] But, I think he might be a genius.",jim,35

45307,"[Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.",jim,9
45314,"Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?",jim,17
45317,"[ignoring Darryl's question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?",jim,17
45319,"Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]",jim,22
45327,What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? [Robert stares at Dwight] What are you doing..? [Dwight sits up abruptly] Stop trying to figure me out.,dwight,31
45329,You can't.,dwight,2
45331,"No, it's not.",dwight,3
45333,Stop trying to figure me out. [Robert turns to ignore Dwight] Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made?,dwight,21
45335,[standing up] Get out.,dwight,4
45336,"I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring.",dwight,31

45376,Okay. Let me think... are you counting car windows?,andy,9
45378,"[happily] Uh, 93 million miles.",andy,5
45379,[to Gabe] Is it?,jim,4
45380,"Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and... [Gabe looks visibily annoyed] 333,000 times heavier than the Earth,...",andy,30
45382,"[alone in his car] I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!!",andy,30
45385,How is this on me?,pam,5
45386,Hang up. [Creed hangs up] Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. [shows Creed two similar-looking photos of some building] Intel has told us there were at least seven.,pam,35
45388,They're the same picture.,pam,4
45390,"Your department's just you, right?",jim,5
45398,"[comes in, slapping some papers on the table] I want an interview.",dwight,12
45399,[walking with Jim in the parking lot] How's the family?,dwight,10
45400,Good!,jim,1
45401,Good. They good?,dwight,3
45402,Yeah.,jim,1
45403,What's your daughter's name again? Peepee?,dwight,6
45404,Peepa.,jim,1
45405,"Peepa, how is she?",dwight,4
45406,Great.,jim,1
45407,"Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?",dwight,15
45408,No.,jim,1
45409,"Now, listen,...",dwight,2
45410,"You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.",jim,23
45411,"Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat [motions to grip Jim's throat] is the strong hand you want on the wheel.",dwight,42
45412,[pulls Dwight's arm down] Okay. That's vivid.,jim,7
45413,"I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam...",dwight,57
45414,Yikes.,jim,1
45415,Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.,dwight,7
45416,"Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile]",jim,10
45417,Ha ha! [pats Jim on the back],dwight,7
45418,"Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?",jim,26
45419,"Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this.",dwight,10
45420,Okay.,jim,1
45421,Let me get that for you. [runs ahead to open the door for Jim],dwight,14
45422,Thank you.,jim,2
45423,Okay. [looks ashamed],dwight,3
45425,"The Senator? [Oscar nods] He was married before, and he has a kid.",pam,13
45427,And don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.,pam,13
45429,Did you see him at a bathhouse?,pam,7
45431,The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.,pam,7
45433,Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.,pam,10
45435,You're in the gay mafia.,pam,5
45438,No.,pam,1
45452,Great.,jim,1
45454,I'm sure it's fine.,jim,4
45456,Howard Cline?,jim,2
45458,[checks sheet] Oh... Deshaun Williams.,jim,5
45460,He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...,jim,17
45462,Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. [Darryl taps a couple times on Jim's desk and walks away],jim,27
45468,"That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?",jim,25
45474,I think that's probably all we need to hear from...,jim,10
45476,That's very...,jim,2
45481,You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.,jim,13
45483,"No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.",jim,30
45488,Uh--,jim,1
45490,"Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.",jim,15
45496,"No, was it good?",jim,4
45503,"[clears throat] Jo, may I speak to you for a second?",dwight,11
45505,"Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position.",dwight,28
45507,Okay.,dwight,1
45509,It's complicated.,dwight,2
45512,I'm a woman. I would want to know.,pam,8
45517,She does seem happy.,pam,4
45520,Okay.,pam,1
45527,"Uh, just put him through to me.",pam,7
45529,Hello! This is... the client.,pam,5
45531,Yes.,pam,1
45533,Great.,pam,1
45535,"Thank you, bye-bye.",pam,3
45542,[mumbling through the gauze] Assistant Regional Manager.,dwight,7
45543,Assistant to the Regional Manager.,jim,5
45544,[again] Assistant Regional Manager.,dwight,4
45545,What is it?,jim,3
45546,[in a cheesy French accent] Assistant Regional Manager.,dwight,8
45547,"Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty.",jim,34
45549,Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... [takes off sunglasses and reveals his face] It's me. I'm Dwight.,dwight,18
45550,"[looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the... [trails off]",jim,17
45551,[whispers] Yeah.,dwight,2
45552,[looks astonished] Ohhhh!,jim,3
45555,"I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!",dwight,28
45557,Yes.,dwight,1
45559,"This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, 'just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.'",jim,42
45561,Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.,jim,10
45571,Um... why Kelly?,jim,3
45573,Okay.,jim,1
45575,"Oh, I didn't know you knew her?",jim,7
45577,No.,jim,1
45579,"You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.",jim,17
45591,Silence?,dwight,1
45593,"Hey, Erin.",andy,2
45595,Where'd you learn how to puppet like that?,andy,8
45597,"Listen, I'm really flattered, but I don't think we should.",andy,10
45602,That was our dream wedding.,pam,5
45604,"[looks over at Oscar, who is quietly watching this happen] I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.",pam,19
45606,All right. Name.,jim,3
45607,Dwight Schrute.,dwight,2
45608,"Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know.",jim,12
45609,You have to interview me...,dwight,5
45610,I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.,jim,16
45611,I demand more questions!,dwight,4
45612,"[ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.",jim,13
45613,"Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it.",dwight,12
45614,Yes.,jim,1
45616,"Thank you, Dwight.",jim,3
45617,"Thank you. [clears throat and gets up] You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. [smiles] Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting. [leaves]",dwight,40
45618,"Well, that was quick.",jim,4
45620,He's not a real candidate.,jim,5
45622,You took the deal.,jim,4
45624,That's not okay.,jim,3
45627,What is happening right now?,jim,5
45629,"No, why would you think that?",jim,6
45631,"Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.",jim,25
45633,"No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.",jim,10
45634,"Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad.",dwight,18
45635,Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.,jim,24
45636,Tuna... You're completely sane.,andy,4
45637,Thank you.,jim,2
45638,"Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?",andy,29
45639,"Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?",jim,11
45641,[while sighing] I suppose I am.,jim,6
45648,Yes.,jim,1
45650,Okay.,jim,1
45651,What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.,dwight,6
45654,"Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. [Stanley shakes his head and rolls his eyes] Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.",andy,23
45656,Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-,jim,12
45658,A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.,pam,7
45660,"No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person.",pam,21
45664,Hey! Hey! Hey!,jim,3
45666,She may have a point there... would a small penis work? Small-to-moderate.,andy,12
45668,"Ohh, hey Gabe, I'm sorry, we... we didn't get you a cake or anything. We're gonna miss you.",pam,18
45677,"We're gonna miss you, Gabe. [Gabe leaves]",dwight,7
45678,"[stands up] Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I'm educated. I'm capable. I like all of you... and I won't make any changes.",andy,31
45682,"What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?",jim,13
45692,"What? No, no, it's not a vote.",jim,7
45694,I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.,jim,10
45697,Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I'm about to do that.,andy,14
45704,"I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or... [shrugs] I don't know. Something always works out. [leaves]",dwight,21
45706,"[in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Is that right?",pam,7
45708,"Well, okay!",pam,2
45710,[in a comedic male voice] Hello!,pam,6
45711,"[in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Hello!",pam,5
45712,"Hi, how are ya? [Erin looks amused, Stanley and Phyllis look at Pam, confused]",pam,14
45713,"Ohho! I'm good! Don't you just love paper, and things about paper!",pam,12
45714,"Hey, are you single? This seems like a love connection to me!",pam,12
45719,[exiting elevator] After you my good sir.,andy,7
45720,"No, I insist.",dwight,3
45721,I insist.,andy,2
45725,"Uh, this has got to stop.",andy,6
45727,K... Kevin! [Kevin planking on Dwight's desk],dwight,7
45729,"K, I'm gonna need some help. Pam?",dwight,7
45730,I don't think I should.,pam,5
45731,"Oh, yeah. Pregnant.",jim,3
45732,Right here. Little Michael Scott- [points to her belly],pam,9
45733,"No, I told you I don't like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.",jim,17
45734,Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office.,pam,23
45736,"Wait, when did we start calling it that-",pam,8
45738,"Well, I am a few months ahead of you.",pam,9
45740,"Hoist him aloft. C'mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl. [trying to lift Kevin off desk]",dwight,14
45745,No one should be planking at all.,jim,7
45746,"Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?",andy,15
45747,Say no more.,dwight,3
45748,"[starts attacking plankers] Kids, don't try planking. It's dangerous. [knocks Toby off table] 'Specially with me around.",dwight,17
45749,"You watching that commercial again? [Pam nods] Why do you keep watching it, if you know it's just gonna make you cry?",jim,22
45750,"Because everything makes me cry, so what's the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone.",pam,18
45751,He's got a bank vault. That's a start.,jim,8
45752,Not enough though.,pam,3
45753,"The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he's gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it's not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It's strange.",jim,58
45761,"Hey, Robert. We have that 9:30am casual chit-chat scheduled. I emailed you about it last night to confirm. And again this morning.",andy,22
45762,"First item on the agenda: can I get everyone an extra long Columbus Day weekend. Item number two, connect with the guy. Robert California, what does he think of me? Don't know, super care. Number three, time permitting, we lost our biggest client.",andy,43
45764,Jim. [motions him over],pam,4
45765,[motions he is on the phone] Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. [comes over] Okay. [sees notebook with two lists of staff names] What is this?,jim,30
45766,The Friday before Columbus Day. Thoughts?,andy,6
45768,"Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women's soccer, no?",andy,12
45769,What are you looking at?,dwight,5
45770,"It's, it's nothing.",jim,3
45771,It can't be nothing.,dwight,4
45773,"It's just a list of our names, split into two columns.",jim,11
45775,"Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?",jim,15
45777,"No. Okay. Um, I'll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?",jim,16
45778,"[throws hard, Jim doesn't catch] Nice catch.",dwight,7
45779,"If he comes out, distract him. [takes list to copier]",pam,10
45781,"We don't need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-",jim,13
45783,"I promise you, we don't need a warning-",jim,8
45786,Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay?,dwight,6
45788,"' 2, 3! [pulls Phyllis up]",dwight,6
45790,"Okay, which side of the list am I on?",dwight,9
45791,Left.,jim,1
45792,Yes!,dwight,1
45793,Why are you- How do you know?,jim,7
45794,Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work.,andy,12
45795,"Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert's notebook.",jim,8
45796,He left it at reception and we photocopied it.,pam,9
45797,"Oh, okay. I don't want any part of this.",andy,9
45798,Maybe it's a list of people he's gonna fire.,pam,9
45799,"Okay, it's not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.",jim,20
45800,This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here's something. Who would eat who in an 'Alive' situation. No... that can't be it.,dwight,47
45801,"I gotta say. Kinda seems like the left side's the side to be on. Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl. No offense Pam.",andy,21
45802,I don't think it's-,jim,4
45803,'Scuse me?,pam,2
45804,"Shhh, Pam. C'mon, don't be such a right-sider.",dwight,8
45806,We couldn't crack it.,andy,4
45808,He'll know that we looked at his private notebook.,andy,9
45810,I'm already working on this Columbus Day thing for you guys and it's starting to stack up. Feels like a lot. One thing at a time.,andy,26
45813,"What's up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk.",andy,15
45815,And it was open. And people saw this. And they're just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is.,andy,20
45817,It's a photocopy from your notebook.,andy,6
45819,No. They did. And they asked me to ask about it.,andy,11
45821,What?,andy,1
45823,"That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name?",andy,24
45825,"Okay. Robert's in the annex, everybody think quick. What do these groups have in common?",andy,15
45827,That's not it.,jim,3
45829,"Mmum, still wrong.",jim,3
45830,"Stanley, you do puzzles all day. Whatdo we got?",andy,9
45832,"Thank you. A little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys.",andy,17
45835,"No, it's not. Here's how we find out. Let's line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Let's just size each other up here and left side of the list' ATTACK!",dwight,53
45836,"Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?! [Kelly and Erin screaming as Dwight bashes their heads together, everyone attacking each other and yelling]",jim,25
45837,Dwight!,andy,1
45841,That's great. Let's do this guys.,dwight,6
45842,"Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.",jim,9
45843,I love you so much. [starting to cry],pam,8
45844,Hey. It's nothing. Alright? I'll text you when we get there. Let you know what's going on.,jim,17
45845,Okay. [turns to computer],pam,4
45846,Nope. No dog video.,jim,4
45847,Okay.,pam,1
45848,Okay. See you guys.,jim,4
45849,"Well, we should all be really excited about our very own pizza party. Pizza partay! Pizza! Partay! Pizza! Partay!",andy,19
45851,"Uhhh, the street?",jim,3
45853,"Oh, I didn't know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.",jim,16
45855,Right.,jim,1
45857,"Yeah, she does like Elmo.",jim,5
45863,Great group! Pizza party!,andy,4
45865,"Well, why don't you ask me again when the five pizzas get here.",andy,13
45867,Okay. You guys ever had Margarita pizza?,andy,7
45869,Fresh tomato with a dollop of mozzarella cheese.,andy,8
45871,That's regular pizza.,pam,3
45872,"You know, I feel comfortable enough now to ask you this question... what made you pick this group?",dwight,18
45874,Okay!,dwight,1
45877,Losers.,dwight,1
45879,C'mon.,dwight,1
45881,"C'mon, c'mon.",dwight,2
45883,C'mon.,dwight,1
45885,"Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!",dwight,9
45887,Ah hah! Their interpretation of Margarita pizza. Fans of classic pizza will be psyched.,andy,14
45888,"[Pam's phone vibrates] Oh, text from Jim. 'This is getting very weird. Will explain later.'",pam,15
45889,"[Everyone's phone vibrates] Oh, text from Kevin.",pam,7
45892,"I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, 'Who's that receptionist? I like her.' Now I'm just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and you're like, 'Oh, loser.'",pam,51
45893,"C'mon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously?",andy,20
45894,Oh. Oh God.,pam,3
45898,Yeah?,andy,1
45899,"Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now it's over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy.",dwight,22
45901,"Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?",jim,10
45902,"Yeah, I'm fine.",pam,3
45905,"When I was a salesman I could just be like 'Not my job, not my prob. I'm going to the warehouse to polish my knob.' Metaphorically, of course. But now, it is my job and my prob.",andy,37
45906,"Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please it's really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let's say top-tier and others would be second-tier.",andy,38
45908,"Thank you. Great.
Robert. I said winners and losers. Is that what you're talking about?",andy,14
45909,"Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what I'm thinking of. Can you clarify that?",andy,16
45912,"No. No, no.",andy,3
45914,I'm going in there.,andy,4
45915,"I know that every time I talk to you things just seem to get worse. But, you don't know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well, then I'm not doing my job as regional manager. So, please take this pen and change your list.",andy,52
45917,"Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley... you may think he's a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he's hard to love, but did you know that he's in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships?",andy,58
45919,"Meredith Palmer... Supplier relations. The word 'no' not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I'm being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with.",andy,48
45920,"Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.",dwight,8
45921,Shhh.,jim,1
45922,"Erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. A winner if there ever was one.",andy,15
45925,"Yes. No! The Friday before Columbus Day, we're gonna take a half-day, so that everyone can get a jump on the long weekend.",andy,23
45927,"Yes, I do.",andy,3
45929,I don't care. [Robert smiles as Andy exits],andy,8
45930,"Hey guys. So Columbus Day, we got that half-day on Friday.",andy,11
45932,"Well, you got it this year too.",andy,7
45934,Night.,andy,1
45937,Good night.,dwight,2
45938,Night.,andy,1
45939,"Alright, I'm gonna go warm up the car.",jim,8
45940,"Okay. Oh, uh, you dropped something. Jim?",pam,7
45941,"Okay, I know I've been crying easily today, but- [shows unfolded paper Jim dropped, shows two lists, 'Pam' and 'Cece' on one side, 'Everything else' on the other] I mean, that's just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe it's stupid. No. [starts crying] It's wonderful. I'm gonna frame it. I can always unframe it.",pam,54
45942,"I gotta say, I think it's kinda cool not knowing. It's like one of those movies that ends on a note of mystery. Did the butler do it? Are they ghosts? You know? It's kinda sophisticated.",andy,36
45944,"[weepy] Yeah, I hate those endings.",pam,6
45952,"[grunting, trying with Jim to lift Kevin planking on his desk] Man, it's like hoisting a manatee. I can't get a grip it's so vast.",dwight,25

46019,"K, Kevin, are you saying 'See the world'? or 'Sea World?'",jim,11
46021,"No, see? Right there, that's the problem with your method. 'Cause I still don't know if you're saying 'Sea World' or 'see the world,' and it's taking a lot of time to explain it.",jim,34

46502,"It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it.",jim,26

46524,"But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.",jim,9
46525,And it's clear we're not going to carry them. [Dwight grunts loudly in shot showing them sliding boxes over the greased floor],dwight,22
46526,"So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.",jim,9

46561,Why is the truck empty?,andy,5
46562,"Uh, it's not totally empty.",dwight,5
46564,"OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.",dwight,22

46591,Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.,pam,12

46594,[laughs] Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.,jim,9
46595,Oh..,pam,1
46596,But what are you gonna do about that?,jim,8
46597,What are you gonna do?,pam,5
46601,"Ok, ok. We are so close. All we have to do is figure out that corner and we're basically there.",jim,20
46602,"I know. Kevin, we've been friends for a long time, right?",dwight,11
46604,So if I was to ask you to sacrifice your body and lay down on a greasy corner and act as a human bumper shield-,dwight,25
46605,"Ok, Dwight! Come on. Here, I think I have an idea.",jim,11
46606,"I wouldn't be asking you lightly, now would I?",dwight,9
46608,"Right. Now do you wanna wear a trash bag, er...",dwight,10
46609,Dammit Dwight!,jim,2
46611,"Ok, I have a question. Why is the truck so far away?",jim,12
46614,"Ok, I just asked that ques-, I don't know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.",jim,32
46615,"Yeah, why is it so far away Jim?",dwight,8
46616,So this warehouse has been around for what? Like a thousand years? And they never thought to back the truck up into it? I guess sometimes it just takes a fresh set of eyes. Alright! [knocks on side of truck],jim,40
46620,Whoa whoa whoa!,jim,3
46624,"No! Stop! Stop stop stop stop! You're way over! Ok, you gotta cut it! Cut it hard! (bleep!) Stop stop stop stop! Stop, stop! Dammit Dwight. Great.",jim,27

46634,"What? [Stanley enters office laughing] Morning, Stanley.",andy,7
46635,"There's this thing that people tend to do with billboards. How do I put this? If there's an opportunity for a graffiti artist to work in a... phallic shape, interacting with the artwork, it'll happen, and Andy gave them that opportunity.",jim,41

46638,"Oh, god. I need you to call the billboard company.",andy,10
46640,Which one did you see?,andy,5

47046,It's a root you idiot.,dwight,5
47048,That's really rude.  I don't tell you hurricanes suck even though it's true.,dwight,14
47050,Try influenza.,dwight,2
47052,Open up a newspaper.  Oh look a hurricane's coming.  I suppose you're going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?,dwight,24
47054,You know that's',jim,3
47056,I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.,jim,27
47065,Party looks fun doesn't it?  Everybody seems to be in there having a great time.  So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.,jim,33
47067,[to Dwight] Are you serious?,jim,5
47068,Yeah I'm serious.,dwight,3
47069,That's funny.  Ok.,jim,4
47070,Loser.,dwight,1
47078,It really looks great.  You did a great job.,andy,10
47080,We should still have that talk.  Maybe you can come by my office at like 4:45? [Erin nods] Cool.,andy,20
47084,What's the story?,andy,3
47088,I think we've seen enough.  You can turn it off now.  [everyone murmurs agreement] Yeah turn it off now.,andy,21
47091,That was awful.  Robert I apologize.,andy,7
47093,What we have here is a classic misunderstanding.,andy,8
47097,Did you think I was going to fire you?  No I wasn't.  [to Robert] I'm sorry this must be really uncomfortable for you.,andy,25
47099,Ok.  Erin I think you know I've been dating someone.,andy,11
47101,And it's getting a little more serious.  She's never come by.,andy,12
47103,No I didn't want her to call because I thought it would be weird.  But now it's weird that she's not calling.,andy,23
47105,Thirty-one.,andy,1
47109,[whispering] Thank you.,jim,3
47110,Jim doesn't let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?,pam,17
47111,"Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win.",jim,17
47112,Really.,pam,1
47113,No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not...,jim,27
47115,Thank you.,jim,2
47116,"Go, get up there right now.",dwight,6
47119,"You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B.",dwight,12
47122,[laughs] Nice.,dwight,2
47124,Got 'em. Go!,dwight,3
47137,"Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, 'Mom, there's a ghost in my closet.' Now, you say one of two things - one, 'You're just having a bad dream,' or two, 'Let's go see what it was.'",jim,39
47138,"I'm not gonna freak her out, Jim.",pam,7
47139,Ok.,jim,1
47140,"I'm not gonna lie to her, either.",pam,7
47141,"Oh, come on!",jim,3
47159,Pink is the red-,jim,4
47161,"I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate. Meredith said she believes in them too.",jim,26
47172,"I'm a Jamaican zombie woman. Leave me alone, ghoul.",dwight,9
47174,"Uh, I know what it is. Ok? I have like a thousand people over every week to watch it. Ok? We all kinda hate it though.",dwight,26
47176,The city of Atlanta.,dwight,4
47178,Thank you.,pam,2
47180,"Oscar, how are you on that side?",jim,7
47181,This isn't about sides. This is about me seeing a blueish gray old man in the mirror and then he vanishes.,pam,21
47183,"No, Creed.",pam,2
47184,But that would make more sense. [Pam sighs],jim,8
47185,[Flickering Lights] Hey everybody it's closing time. You don't got to go home but you can't stay here. [Plays radio and the song is Closing Time by Semisonic],andy,28
47187,Closing time.,andy,2
47188,"Every office needs an end of the day tradition. Something to tell you the day is over.  Otherwise, you go home and the night just feels like more day.  It's weird.",andy,33
47189,Closing time,andy,2
47190,[On phone] ...W R K.,jim,5
47191,One last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey and beer.,andy,11
47192,"Uh no it's W R K, as in kitten.  Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that's what you are hearing.",jim,23
47193,Come on pam!,andy,3
47195,Let's see. Andy has been manager for a hundred and five days. Which means I've heard 'Closing Time' a hundred and five times. [nods and shakes head] Still don't know the words. Tah wa Ta way hm hm home and home and home.,pam,43
47201,Whose your favorite iron chef?,andy,5
47203,You go first.,andy,3
47205,Well the monitoring software is a double edged sword. Sometimes',andy,10
47206,"[runs in and interrupts] Sorry, go ahead.",dwight,7
47208,Wha'Yes. Your attention. Uh because' No that is all. [walks out],dwight,11
47209,"Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power. Athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted 'We're number two!'. As with all my dreams, I'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants.",dwight,56
47211,Umpf'that's not good. Chalk that one up to Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb out there.,andy,15
47213,"They're both Kevin. Oscar is the Sex and the City gang and Angela, if you can picture'",andy,17
47215,I would agree with that.,andy,5
47217,"End the mistakes, easy-",andy,4
47219,I would like that.,andy,4
47221,"I'm just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby's in a really good place now. So'my pitch is'me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine.",jim,27
47223,Is that off again?,jim,4
47225,Ok.,jim,1
47234,"I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project I've been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it.",dwight,31
47235,What do you got?,andy,4
47236,"[opens folder] Allow me. You're going to love this. [struggles opening folder] Ugh'should've used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work.",dwight,36
47237,Sounds controversial.,andy,2
47238,Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?,dwight,16
47239,Do not go there! You're the deuce I never want to drop.,andy,12
47240,"Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.",dwight,17
47241,Go do the voodoo that you do so well.,andy,9
47242,I will do my voodoo.,dwight,5
47243,Mmhmmm.,andy,1
47260,"Hi guys. I just wanted to say that, you all have been doing amazing work., really.",andy,16
47262,"And I'd like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call'Dwight'",andy,27
47263,The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you're out.,dwight,38
47264,"If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper.",andy,18
47265,Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.,dwight,49
47267,"Robert's favorite songs: Creep by TLC, Creep by Radio Head. You remember that one Jim? There is no way he hasn't strangled at least one stripper. Oscar. He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him. Kelly.",dwight,40
47269,P.S. We should should kill him.,dwight,6
47270,"Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?",jim,7
47271,"No, it's an accountability booster.",dwight,5
47272,Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.,jim,14
47273,"Jim, you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task.",dwight,43
47276,[Everyone angrily disagreeing]Smile'nod. Smile and nod.,dwight,6
47277,"They are making me out to be a Bond villian. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world. Like'not Doctor Moreau someone good. Doctor Frankenstein, Doctor Jekyll, not them. Doctor'",dwight,41
47278,"Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes.",andy,22
47279,"But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve.",dwight,13
47280,"Alright everybody, looks like we need to be getting to work. Be extra careful. Double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha.",andy,23
47283,"[alert goes off] Oh, there's one mistake.",dwight,7
47285,Dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I',andy,14
47286,"It's not a doomsday device, gosh. [Erin makes red strike on desk] We can do this you guys.",dwight,18
47307,"Alright everybody, you are doing great!",andy,6
47308,"Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work. [Meredith gives dwight the finger]",dwight,36
47309,"Dwight, question.",jim,2
47310,No questions.,dwight,2
47311,If this doomsday device goes off...,jim,6
47312,Accountability booster.,dwight,2
47313,If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?,jim,20
47314,I haven't even considered it. That's how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.,dwight,18
47317,Ok.,jim,1
47318,How about Scrantonstrangler666.,dwight,3
47319,Nope.,jim,1
47320,"No. Oh shoot. Ha ha ha'You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won't even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike.",dwight,46
47322,Hmm'Heda. [alert] No.,jim,3
47340,Gahhh. That's five strikes.,andy,4
47342,Dwight we got five strikes.,andy,5
47343,Really?,dwight,1
47344,Did the email go out or',andy,6
47345,It goes out automatically at five P.M.,dwight,7
47346,"Well, th- There's gotta be a way to stop it.",andy,10
47347,"Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it.",dwight,13
47348,Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password.,andy,8
47349,No.,dwight,1
47350,What?!,andy,1
47351,You don't deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day.,dwight,14
47353,"No you didn't, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine. [everyone interjects] What?!",dwight,23
47355,"Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?",dwight,33
47357,"Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please.",dwight,9
47358,Nn no.,andy,2
47359,What?,dwight,1
47360,No!,andy,1
47363,Good luck finding a new job idiots. I'll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.,dwight,18
47365,I bet he went home.,pam,5
47366,Some of us should go there and talk some sense into him. Get him to stop that email.,andy,18
47367,"Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us.",andy,19
47369,Kevin has that lovability.,andy,4
47371,"Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five. You can try to delete it or something.",andy,29
47372,"Ok, where is he?",jim,4
47374,I'll try both.,jim,3
47375,[digging] Oh. Come to reason with me?,dwight,7
47376,"Gotcha something. [gives Dwight cap, Dwight throws it aside] And, uh, I just really want to talk to you-",andy,19
47377,Get lost.,dwight,2
47378,"Well now hold on it, it-",andy,6
47379,What are you doing?,pam,4
47380,What does it look like I'm doing? Digging a grave for a horse.,dwight,13
47381,Uhm.,pam,1
47383,"Yeah, do you need a hand? [everyone joins in]",pam,9
47384,"If you hit another horse, you've dug to far.",dwight,9
47386,Robert.,jim,1
47388,"Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.",jim,10
47390,You up for a game?,jim,5
47392,Exactly. Here we go. Let's do it.,jim,7
47393,"Are you okay, Kevin? [Kevin gives thumbs down]",pam,8
47394,[to Dwight] Where you going?,andy,5
47395,In. I'm hungry.,dwight,3
47396,"Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water.",pam,10
47397,"Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on.",dwight,11

47399,"This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009.",dwight,20

47414,In the box. [hits it straight into the floor],jim,9
47421,"Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobody's nerfect, right?",pam,7
47422,"Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It's 'Nobody's perfect.' Nice stroke, Pam.",dwight,13

47429,Don't say cow- Ugh.,dwight,4
47430,What are you doing? It's 5 to 5.,andy,8
47431,"Just don't talk about the email, okay? He's gonna cancel it on his own, I really think he will.",pam,19
47432,That's insane!,andy,2
47433,Just trust me.,pam,3
47434,"Trust you, like I trusted Dwight this morning.",andy,8
47435,I got this.,pam,3
47436,Enngh-,andy,1
47437,"Hahhh, thanks for everything.",pam,4
47438,"Sive drafely. [Pam points back at him, smiling]",dwight,8

47442,"Nah, I think it's mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright.",jim,12
47444,"Oh, oh yeah.",jim,3
47446,Yes. Right now? Yes.,jim,4
47448,Here you go. [throws it over glass],jim,7
47451,"Awww, sorry. Did it break?",jim,5
47453,You sure?,jim,2
47455,What kinda iPhone is that?,jim,5
47457,Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?,jim,13
47459,"Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so- [texting on his phone]",jim,23
47461,[her text tones rings] Dwight stopped the device!,pam,8
47462,Oh!,andy,1
47467,"They're not my favorite people in the world. I wouldn't even call them friends. They come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave you've ever seen. [pulls cap he previously discarded, out of the dirt] God, I'm gonna have to work with them forever, aren't I?",dwight,49
47469,"[hits ball, ricochets to groin] Ah! Classic, right? [Jim continues to rally poorly and falls down]",jim,16

47473,Yep.,jim,1
47475,Yep. Ah. Oh. [and skinned elbow],jim,6
47477,Yeah. That does not feel good.,jim,6
47479,Let's not make any mistakes today. Or at least no more than four.,andy,13
47482,This could be real. Dwight's pretty handy with computers. He fixed my laptop once.,pam,14
47483,"Ok, he didn't fix it. The brightness level was all the way down.",jim,13
47484,You couldn't fix it.,pam,4
47485,I wasn't here that day.,jim,5
47486,Yes you were.,pam,3
47487,"No- Ok. Well, we'll talk about it later. Straussburg! I had a meeting in Straussburg and I dropped you off beforehand. I was wearing a tan shirt with stripes?",jim,29
47488,"I don't think so, babe.",pam,5
47489,"Ok, this is crazy.",jim,4
47490,"I have never played squash. But I have seen it in countless 80's movies and it seems like the most common mistake is that you serve too hard and hit yourself right in the squash balls. So, as long as I don't do that, I think I'll be alright.",jim,49
47492,[grunts] Good game. You are a worthy opponent. You wanna play one more?,jim,13
47494,No? Come on.,jim,3
47496,"Well, that is... because you didn't realize that... I was left-handed.",jim,11

47503,"Hey, Andy.",dwight,2
47504,Yeah?,andy,1
47505,"Maybe I could sit in on this one with you? You know, that way I can cover you in case you need to urinate or you just want another opinion, or defecate...",dwight,32
47506,I don't think so.,andy,4
47507,Well I just thought with my new increased responsibilities and all...,dwight,11
47508,"Yeah. I'm still figuring out the two man bobsled here, so let's hold off on the D-man for now.",andy,19
47509,Erin.,andy,1
47511,In two minutes I want you to come into this meeting and tell me I have a really important phone call. I'm not going to take it because I want him to know how important the meeting is to me.,andy,40
47513,Nobody. Just say that I'm-  Just make it up that I have a phone call. And then I'm going to refuse to take it.,andy,25
47515,Just make up a phone call. It's not a real call. Make it up.,andy,14
47517,And come and tell me. Doesn't matter what it is.,andy,10
47519,I'm not going to take it. And then he's going to be like 'whoa this is a really important meeting'.,andy,20
47521,Okay.,andy,1
47522,"Ok, so tell me exactly what kind of deal you are getting now and I'll tell you how we can beat it.",andy,22
47525,Yeah.,andy,1
47527,I'm sorry ' I'm with a very important client. It'll have to wait.,andy,13
47529,There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting.,andy,12
47532,I don't think she's dead.,andy,5
47534,She's not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls.,andy,13
47536,Andy I'm really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.,dwight,10
47538,Yeah. Um line 1?,andy,4
47540,Hi.,andy,1
47542,"Ooh, gosh!",andy,2
47544,Officer.,andy,1
47546,Did she have any last words or?,andy,7
47548,Oh make sure that your client gets the best deal possible.,andy,11
47550,That is so mom.,andy,4
47552,Alright thank you officer. Erin please hold all my other calls. Where were we?,andy,14
47553,Hey Cathy.,pam,2
47555,How's it going? Everything make sense?,pam,6
47557,Great.,pam,1
47559,"Oh no, I'm fine.",pam,4
47561,Ok [squeaking sound] Oh that was just me. Pregnant Pam. And I make sounds much worse than this.,pam,18
47562,Oh we know.,dwight,3
47563,I'm training a temp to be my replacement while I'm on maternity leave. Oh I should've mentioned I'm pregnant. You probably didn't notice because it's impossible to tell I'm so small. But yeah I'm pregnant. [another squeak] Oh come on!,pam,40
47565,Hmm. Doubt it.,jim,3
47567,You doubt it?,pam,3
47568,What's that?,jim,2
47569,Why do you doubt that she's single?,pam,7
47570,Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we'd save her from Ryan right?,jim,14
47572,I'm delivering it from the fridge. It's like a porno. Hey did anyone order a pizza?,andy,16
47574,Yeah and we're not about to make love. I just thought maybe you'd want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes.,andy,38
47576,Uh you tell me [Kevin playing drums with chicken legs],andy,10
47582,It's going to be good to have someone hot at Pam's desk huh?,pam,13
47584,I'm kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! She's obviously super cute I get it. But I'd like to point out there's 50 pounds more of me to love if that's your thing.,pam,32
47587,Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.,pam,9
47590,Really well thank you all.,pam,5
47594,Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you're saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.,dwight,26
47596,No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.,dwight,24
47598,Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That's right. You're fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.,dwight,22
47599,"[scatting] Ske-be-do-bah-bap-bah-de, ske-be-de-bapa-de-bapa-boopa-dooten-bebe-daten-booray.",andy,3
47601,Thank you. I think I said doop instead of boop at one point.,andy,13
47604,"[sees Robert California enter] Hey Robert, are we meeting early?",andy,10
47606,Well we're all musicians and we play together sometimes.,andy,9
47608,Thank you.,andy,2
47612,Miss no more! What do you play? Join us!,andy,9
47615,[to Kevin] CEOs don't play tambourines. Tambourines are for girlfriends.,andy,10
47617,Great!,andy,1
47620,"I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band! And when you're in a rock and roll band with somebody, you're bonded for life!",andy,35
47622,"Yeah, even cooler.",andy,3
47624,Hey.,pam,1
47625,Hey.,jim,1
47626,Helen Mirren. Hot?,pam,3
47627,Yeah. Super pretty.,jim,3
47628,Huh. What about Cathy?,pam,4
47629,The temp?,jim,2
47630,Yeah. Do you think she's hot?,pam,6
47631,Nope.,jim,1
47632,"I'm not asking if you're in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?",pam,15
47633,"And I'm telling you, I don't.",jim,6
47634,You don't find Cathy attractive?,pam,5
47635,"No, I don't.",jim,3
47636,"No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I'm not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody.",jim,41
47637,Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake.,pam,11
47638,"Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good? [Jim leaves]",jim,10
47639,That's just absurd.,dwight,3
47640,"Yes, because she's hot, right?",pam,5
47641,"Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on.",dwight,19
47642,"The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you're a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren't true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth.",pam,49
47643,"Dwight, am I hot right now?",pam,6
47644,"Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction.",dwight,24
47645,What about before? Was I attractive before?,pam,7
47646,"Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low.",dwight,40
47647,Hmm. I think Jim's lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.,pam,13
47648,You think Jim's lying? [laughs] That's so cute. I know he's lying.,dwight,12
47649,Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.,pam,10
47650,Done. [Pam goes for a high five] I never touch a pregnant woman.,dwight,13
47651,"Yep, that's the Dwight I need.",pam,6
47652,"If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules.",dwight,11
47653,Okay.,pam,1
47654,Rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth.,dwight,9
47655,I think so. Okay.,pam,4
47656,Rule two: we stop at nothing.,dwight,6
47657,"Well, what does that... is that... okay.",pam,7
47658,Rule three: Don't fall in love.,dwight,6
47659,"Yep, good.",pam,2
47660,We're gonna bust this guy.,dwight,5
47661,Honesty is very important to me.,pam,6
47662,So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.,dwight,10
47663,Let's just see how we feel when we get there.,pam,10
47665,None taken. What do you got?,dwight,6
47667,Hmm.,pam,1
47676,"Yeah, absolutely!",andy,2
47684,Midnight what?,andy,2
47686,"Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single.",pam,11
47687,"Oh, I stand corrected.",jim,4
47688,I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?,pam,14
47689,"Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.",jim,9
47690,"Mike Tibbets, really?",pam,3
47691,Mm-hmm.,jim,1
47693,Not his mom's car.,jim,4
47695,Touche?,jim,1
47697,"Kelly, calm down.",pam,3
47699,I don't think Jim cares about his hair.,pam,8
47701,I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer.,dwight,16
47702,Jim's on to me.,pam,4
47703,Hmm?,dwight,1
47704,"Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.",pam,34
47705,Just ugly enough to have deniability.,dwight,6
47706,Yep.,pam,1
47707,"Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy.",jim,38
47708,"Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can't lie with his body.",dwight,15
47710,"No, Kelly, don't.",pam,3
47711,"The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there.",dwight,27
47713,With the crotch.,dwight,3
47715,Psst. We're not here. [slips Toblerone candy to Creed],dwight,9
47717,Exactly.,dwight,1
47719,"Okay, just shut it.",dwight,4
47720,Is he puffing out his chest?,pam,6
47721,I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. [Jim says something and Cathy laughs] Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?,dwight,21
47722,No. Maybe he just said something funny.,pam,7
47723,"Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.",dwight,12
47724,I think he's just making her laugh.,pam,7
47725,Time for me to find out.,dwight,6
47726,Why's he making her laugh so much?,pam,7
47727,"Just going to walk over here- [fake trips] whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! [grabs Jim's crotch]",dwight,26
47728,Dwight!,jim,1
47730,"I'm fine, I'm totally fine.",dwight,5
47731,Dwight! Dwight!,jim,2
47732,Yes? [Jim pushes Dwight's hands away] Wha- Jim.,dwight,8
47733,[to Cathy] Sorry about that.,jim,5
47734,"Aw, cramp, I'm just- [grabs Jim's crotch again]",dwight,8
47735,Dwight! [pushes Dwight's hands away] Why?,jim,6
47736,"I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance.",dwight,7
47737,Leave.,jim,1
47738,"[to Pam] Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing.",dwight,21
47739,Why was he making her laugh so much?,pam,8
47740,"Oh, hey, I'll just be a second.",pam,7
47742,Okay.,pam,1
47744,Mm-hmm?,jim,1
47746,[laughs] Told you.,jim,3
47748,"Oscar, Cathy has a question!",pam,5
47750,[to Jim] Yeah?,pam,3
47751,You okay?,jim,2
47752,Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it.,pam,17
47753,"Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?",jim,10
47754,"Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that's where we are now.",pam,20
47755,"She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.",dwight,26
47756,"Yeah, its nuts. But I don't know what else to do.",pam,11
47757,And she called it nuts?,dwight,5
47760,Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan?,andy,9
47766,"Well, we are playing. We're all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It's a jam session. We go where the music takes us. [music starts]",andy,26
47768,Come on.,dwight,2
47769,Stop shoving me.,jim,3
47770,"[mocking] Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.",dwight,28
47771,[to Pam] Really?,jim,3
47772,This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.,pam,12
47774,"Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? [to Jim] Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?",dwight,37
47775,Si.,jim,1
47776,"Wait, that's it? That's the question you're going to ask him?",pam,11
47777,We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.,dwight,14
47779,"[mimicking] Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.",dwight,12
47780,"Okay, Dwight, come on. [to old man] You can go first.",jim,11
47782,"Jim, are you serious?",dwight,4
47783,"Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.",jim,12
47784,Maybe we could switch instruments.,andy,5
47786,"Cause, uh, my body's starting to get bruised.",andy,8
47788,We had to leave because of creative differences.,andy,8
47792,Well-,andy,1
47794,"[to old man] Okay, you're done.",dwight,6
47796,"Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?",dwight,9
47797,"No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.",jim,59
47798,Do you find Cathy Simms attractive?,dwight,6
47799,No.,jim,1
47800,"Yep, he's lying.",dwight,3
47801,"Ah, see, was that so hard?",pam,6
47802,I am not lying.,jim,4
47803,Really?,pam,1
47804,"Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?",jim,11
47805,"I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?",dwight,27
47806,"Wait, what?",pam,2
47807,"Look at the numbers. Every single time, it's come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar.",dwight,19
47808,"Jim, you have high blood pressure.",pam,6
47809,"Oh, he is definitely attracted to her.",dwight,7
47810,Doesn't your dad have high blood pressure?,pam,7
47811,"Yeah, but I don't smoke.",jim,5
47812,When was the last time you went to the doctor?,pam,10
47813,I don't know.,jim,3
47814,It's important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-,dwight,26
47815,"Dwight, stop. I'm not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you?",pam,24
47816,"Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul.",jim,9
47817,"It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.",dwight,12
47818,Okay.,jim,1
47819,"Come on, let's go. I wanna call your doctor.",pam,9
47820,Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?,dwight,14
47821,Just go home. It doesn't matter.,pam,6
47822,"But... hey, Cece's toothbrush.",dwight,4
47823,Thank you.,jim,2
47829,[scatting] Rudit-do-do-do-di-do.,andy,2
47832,"Hey! All right, obviously we all want to die but we have to get through this. So, Gabe go ahead. It's okay.",andy,22
47834,[whispers to Jim] I'm gonna do it.,pam,7
47836,Oh! I'm going into labor! Oh my goodness!,pam,8
47837,"Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody!",jim,9
47838,"I know it's wrong to fake going into labor just to get out of things, but sometimes it's necessary.",pam,19
47839,[after Angela gives her a stack of files]: I'm going into labor!,pam,12
47841,I'm going into labor!,pam,4
47843,I'm going into labor.,pam,4
47844,Here we go!,pam,3
47845,"Hey guys, uh, can't keep saying you're going into labor. Everyone knows you're full of it.",andy,16
47850,Never cry wolf.,andy,3
47851,Okay.,jim,1
47852,Okay.,pam,1
47854,Oh! Oh!,pam,2
47856,Oh my God!,jim,3
47857,I'm really in labor! This is happening!,pam,7
47858,"Okay guys, here we go! We'll see you!",jim,8
47859,Oh!,pam,1
47860,How do you feel?,jim,4
47864,False alarm.,pam,2
47865,"[on the phone] What?! They took another client from us? Okay, bye. Man! Business is war! Customers, clients- it's like a war out there.",andy,24
47866,I am a leader. But you can only inspire people so much in a place like this. So today I'm turning the inspire-factor up to ten with a little help from my friend America's bloodiest battle.,andy,36
47867,Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that?,andy,18
47869,"[gags, coughs] Well we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is-",andy,23
47871,That sounds super inspiring! I'm in!,andy,6
47872,Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.,dwight,12
47874,Ha!,dwight,1
47875,The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms. [scoffs] Whatever. I'm over it. It's just grossly irresponsible.,dwight,23
47876,Charge!,andy,1
47878,"Yeah, well, the bus has free wifi and I made special low-sugar lunches for everyone. And is anyone kosher or halal?",andy,21
47880,"Dates, tabbouleh, and a bagel with cream cheese.",andy,8
47882,"You know, it's the same as the kosher option. There's a lesson in there. I mean, I can't force you to go. You're not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But... who's coming with me?",andy,34
47885,Guess I'm a sucker for historical fiction.,dwight,7
47886,"Anyone who's not going, you're dead to me. You're uninvited. I don't want you to come. But, FYI, there will be leftover turkey and pesto sammies in the fridge.",andy,29
47888,[passes out hats] One for you.,andy,6
47890,And one for you.,andy,4
47891,Cool. Thanks. [puts his hat on Erin's head],jim,8
47892,"And- oh. You missed your head. [laughs and puts hat on Jim's head] There you go. Phyllis, think fast!",andy,19
47893,"All right, guys, a little foreplay before we do it. Fans of Ken Burns' Jazz will most certainly enjoy Civil War.",andy,21
47896,"It's just not appropri- I mean, if we were going to visit Bradley Cooper's birthplace, I'd be the first one suggesting it. I'd be rooting for it.",andy,27
47898,"All right, all right, all right.",andy,6
47900,Here. Like it?,pam,3
47902,I can't get a fire pit. I have two babies.,pam,10
47905,"Plants and- hi, Robert! Hey, um, how are you doing? Good to see you again.",pam,15
47912,You guys...,andy,2
47914,Get excited!,andy,2
47916,All right! We're here. Limitless can wait.,andy,7
47918,Woo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen the eighteen hundreds await you. We can watch Limitless on the way back.,andy,17
47921,Woo!,andy,1
47922,"Whoa, where you going?",andy,4
47923,"Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?",jim,10
47924,"Yeah, we're not going to the visitor center. We're not tourists.",andy,11
47925,"No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour.",jim,18
47927,Unless you're going on the very specially-created and meticulously-researched Andy Bernard tour.,andy,12
47928,"After Chancellorsville, Lee brought his army up the Shenandoah Valley, right through here! They stopped in this field for a picnic, which they called lunch.",andy,25
47930,"Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you're talking about D.P.A., that's deaths per acre...",dwight,15
47932,...nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms.,dwight,7
47934,"Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. [laughs] I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written.",dwight,44
47936,The truth.,dwight,2
47939,"No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth.",dwight,18
47941,"Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.",dwight,9
47943,"Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this-",dwight,15
47945,"Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?",dwight,26
47947,Not by a long shot!,dwight,5
47950,"No, it was not!",dwight,4
47952,"No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?",dwight,9
47954,Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!,dwight,10
47956,"Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar.",dwight,10
47972,"Excuse me, I got a question for you.",dwight,8
47974,Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?,dwight,10
47976,"Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?",dwight,15
47978,We don't need to bother this poor gentleman. I know exactly where we're going. Giddy up! Tallyho!,andy,17
47985,"Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as, you know, as I tell it, I don't like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it.",pam,53
47987,"Um, excuse me. I'm gonna go to the bathroom.",pam,9
47988,"At this point, when you're this pregnant, it's kind of like senior spring. The other day I spit my gum out on the carpet.",pam,24
48002,"By the way, did we leave all the food on the bus?",jim,12
48003,Let's talk about food for a second. Food for thought.,andy,10
48004,"Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry.",jim,16
48005,Hunger! Hunger for victory! Hunger for honor. Hunger for pride.,andy,10
48010,Only two hundred dollars?,jim,4
48013,"Get the flag! Get the flag! Come on, Big Tuna. What you gonna do about it? We got a flag right here. Wee-hoo!",andy,23
48014,Spangler Springs is a mile this way.,andy,7
48015,Oh wow.  So that's two miles if you incorporate the walk back.,jim,13
48016,Its' I mean come on.,andy,5
48018,Alright fine.  You know what ' I guess this place just hasn't rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would.  I'm still going.  And I'm not going to ask anymore.  I'm not even going to look back.  I'm just going to assume that you're with me.,andy,53
48019,[Andy looks back to find everyone sitting] You said you weren't going to look back.,dwight,15
48025,Really?,dwight,1
48027,Well.  Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms.,dwight,23
48030,YES!  Ha!  Prepare to be refuted!  Go on.,dwight,11
48034,Hallowed ground.,dwight,2
48038,I've seen enough.,dwight,3
48051,[making pencil imprint] Dammit.,andy,4
48053,You guys came.  Where's everyone else?,andy,7
48055,Yeah I asked the bus driver to lock it because our stuff was in there.  I guess he follows orders.,andy,21
48056,Yeah sorry everyone else didn't come.  I think they're just tired.  With holes in their shoes.  And they have dysentery.,jim,23
48057,Even without an audience you're still at it.,andy,8
48058,What are you talking about?,jim,5
48059,Our office has a disease.  And it goes by many names.  Sarcasm.  Snark.  Wisecracks.  You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes.  That's what you did with this trip.,andy,44
48061,You don't like the hats?,andy,5
48062,They're terrible.,jim,2
48064,"They just didn't turn out how I wanted.  In my head they were cooler, but they do look weird.",andy,20
48072,Charge!,andy,1
48075,"It's kind of a haul, so we should probably get going. And tuna, I made a special sandwich for you, guess which kind.",andy,23
48076,Tuna?,jim,1
48077,Yes! Tuna of the land. Turkey. With pesto.,andy,8
48078,And to drink?,jim,3
48079,Water.,andy,1
48080,"Oh-ho, I am in.",jim,4
48081,"I'm excited, I've actually never been to Gettysburg. Uh, my family was gonna go once, but then my brothers convinced me if was full of dead soldier zombies, so I freaked out and we turned the car around. But I'm older now, I can outrun a zombie.",jim,47
48082,"Getting everyone on the bus, check. Giving everyone hats, check. Sexiest eastern European girls, uh, check.",andy,16
48084,Please! Everyone and their mother goes to Devil's Den. It's the Olive Garden of Gettysburg.,andy,15
48086,"Well, I meant that in a bad way. Obviously it tastes good, but it's not cool.",andy,16
48087,Where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground?,jim,14
48088,That is what I'm showing you.,andy,6
48089,"I know what you guys are all thinking right now: Hey, let's go pee on the grave of some confederate soldiers, but you know what? Joke's on you. It only makes the flowers grow back more beautifully.",dwight,37
48090,"Best thing you can do for the deceased is to pee on their graves. Then you dance and work the urine into the root systems. Doesn't hurt to have a smile on your face, either.",dwight,35
48093,It's locked.,jim,2
48095,"It's not locked, gimme that...",dwight,5
48096,"That's weird, if it's not locked, why isn't it opening?",jim,10
48097,"It's, it's latched closed.",dwight,4
48098,"Ok, you know what? Andy probably has the number for this guy. I'm gonna find him.",jim,16
48102,"[enters office doing Michael Jackson impression] Everybody beat it. Don't beat it, stay where you are.",andy,16
48104,What did you say?,andy,4
48106,What would you say?,andy,4
48108,"That is exactly the right thing to say! Do it! Git-er-done! Phyllis, you just married Joe Order, you're new name is Phyllis Order [fill this order], get it?",andy,28
48110,"Jim, in regards to our high-five scheduled for four PM today, it has been moved up to now. Yes.",andy,19
48111,We didn't have one scheduled.,jim,5
48112,"[knocks water bottle on to Jim's desk] Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning.",dwight,16
48113,"Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.",dwight,26
48114,Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you're in a suicide cult.,dwight,24
48116,Oh yeah?,dwight,2
48118,"Hey guys let's just all admit it. Ok? Dwight's better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he's never, ever going to go back on it right?",jim,30
48119,That's right Jim.,dwight,3
48121,[jumping up from an almost sitting position] Hey.,dwight,8
48123,No. Putting a load on more like it.,dwight,8
48125,Last thing I need is luck. [hunches down again],dwight,9
48126,[to Angela] Thank you so much. [hums],dwight,7
48127,[sees a pole poking out Dwight's pant leg] What are you up to? Oops look out! [grabs Dwight's wallet],jim,19
48128,What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!,dwight,9
48129,Prank! [throws money from Dwight's wallet on the floor],jim,9
48130,Oh that's real creative.,dwight,4
48131,You know what it's not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?,jim,19
48132,"I could, but I just don't feel like it loser.",dwight,10
48133,Because you're sitting?,jim,3
48134,Standing.,dwight,1
48135,Ok.,jim,1
48136,Don't!,dwight,1
48137,Because you're sitting?,jim,3
48138,Standing.,dwight,1
48139,You know I have to do this.,jim,7

48142,I think you could just do Andy Bernard.,jim,8
48143,"Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it's like taking a test, but I know the answers.",andy,19
48145,What was that?,andy,3
48146,I don't know. He wasn't talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn't hire his wife.,jim,18
48152,Hey there. It's a pleasure.,andy,5
48154,I would love to. But I have to be completely honest with you guys. We're 100 percent staffed up.,andy,19
48156,Alright.,andy,1
48157,"Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.",dwight,5
48159,[laughs] Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?,dwight,17
48161,Well today's your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?,dwight,23
48163,Your path from obesity begins right here!,dwight,7
48165,"Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash.",dwight,45
48166,Alright! The DM Express is pulling out.,andy,7
48171,We will start here at Erinville.,andy,6
48174,Reception. Your classic one-man operation.,andy,5
48176,I was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just saying.,andy,16
48178,I'll explore exploring it.,andy,4
48180,Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller. [Jim laughs nervously] Alright have at it. Let 'er rip. What do you hate about this place?,andy,38
48181,Well it's sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.,jim,16
48182,Maybe you do. Hi. I'm Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It's paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.,dwight,31
48183,Jim?,andy,1
48184,Well it's not that easy. It's kind of sometimes difficult.,jim,10
48185,It's the second easiest job in the world. [to camera] Being a mom.,dwight,13
48187,That is true.,dwight,3
48188,You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute.,andy,21
48189,That's me.,dwight,2
48190,Dwight why don't you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals.,andy,16
48191,Maybe over a beer after she's closed her first sale [makes gun click noise].,dwight,14
48193,Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? [montage of office workers in friendly interactions with Susan]. The entire office is being nice to her than they've ever been to me. What I wouldn't give for one of Phyllis' classic room clearing farts right now.,andy,46
48194,Ready? What do you think?,dwight,5
48198,Darryl... [picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire],dwight,11
48201,But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is.,andy,11
48203,Those are fully staffed as well.,andy,6
48205,[laughing nervously] Yes.,andy,3
48207,Let me beat around the bush for a second. Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about-,andy,20
48210,There are lots of considerations.,andy,5
48212,Alright. Well then welcome aboard.,andy,5
48214,We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting. [phone rings] Hang on. Hello?,andy,20
48216,Hi gam-gam.,andy,2
48218,Are you taking your med-meds?,andy,5
48221,We promised we'd never say goodbye.,andy,6
48222,Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.,dwight,26
48227,Kelly?,dwight,1
48229,That's okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.,dwight,42
48235,"[sees Susan is busy in the annex] Hey, uh, guys. So Robert doesn't want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away.",andy,29
48240,"I am not asking, I am ordering.",andy,7
48242,"It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you're up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable.",andy,23
48248,"No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing.",jim,34
48250,"Oh, wow. So cute.",jim,4
48260,Very cute. [holds out the phone],jim,6
48266,[in robot voice] What is going on?,andy,7
48268,"Okey-dokey, artichokey. You hate it, don't you?",andy,7
48270,Why would you say that?,andy,5
48272,"It's not that, exactly.",andy,4
48274,"Let's just say that if you don't want to work here, I am totally prepared to respect that.",andy,18
48276,I don't know. [chuckles],andy,4
48278,Yes! The dude is an enigma.,andy,6
48280,Ah... [stammers],andy,2
48282,What do you think you're doing?,dwight,6
48284,"I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?",dwight,15
48286,I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?,dwight,13
48288,Eight minutes!,dwight,2
48290,Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? [points] I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James!,dwight,32
48292,That's what I said.,dwight,4
48294,I know.,dwight,2
48295,[to Susan] Cameras...,andy,3
48299,It just was one of those things-,andy,7
48311,Yes?,andy,1
48314,No games?,andy,2
48316,"Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. Robert storms in and he says, 'in four seconds, my wife's gonna be in here. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen.' [laughs]",andy,41
48319,I am lying. I am a compulsive liar.,andy,8
48321,"No, it's not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there.",andy,26
48327,"[to Hank who is closing the gate] Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay. [runs]",jim,30
48329,"[shoe falls while climbing ladder] Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow. [grunts] Creed. I was never here, all right?",jim,17
48331,Oh boy.,jim,2
48332,"This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked.",dwight,15
48334,"First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.",dwight,14
48336,Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!,dwight,34
48341,"[grabs Jim's leg] No, no. No, no, no! Don't! Damn it, Tuna!",andy,12
48343,Do I?,jim,2
48345,"[mutters] I know, I do.",jim,5
48346,"Jim, I've had enough of your unhelpfulness.",andy,7
48347,I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can...,jim,13
48349,"That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's something: I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.",jim,41
48350,[laughs] I think we've got ourselves an answer.,andy,8
48352,That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day.,andy,11
48353,Perfect!,jim,1
48355,Yes?,jim,1
48359,Yes. All right. Great. [leaves],jim,5
48360,Uh...,andy,1
48362,Yep.,andy,1
48366,"Hey, Mrs. California.",andy,3
48368,"You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me.",andy,15
48370,Yeah.,andy,1
48372,Yeah.,andy,1
48374,Who knows?,andy,2
48376,Totally.,andy,1
48378,Hmm?,andy,1
48379,"You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?",dwight,11
48381,"Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!",dwight,16
48383,"All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?",dwight,19
48385,"No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?",dwight,18
48387,What do you want!?!,dwight,4
48389,Val Kilmer? I don't buy it. That doesn't make any sense. Wow... I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.,dwight,31
48392,"Hey, what are you listening to?",dwight,6
48395,There is no shower.,dwight,4
48397,"What does this look like, a shower store? Get lost.",dwight,10
48399,"Exercise lengthens life. Improves mood, boosts sex drive, and I've already covered the BM of it all. It's miraculous the effect that I will have on their lives.",dwight,28
48400,"So, Roberto Californio doesn't want to work with his wife. I get it. And, he wants to give his wife a job. Totally get it. What I am struggling with is the part of this that's impossible.",andy,37
48402,This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. I'm not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. You know Stanley's tie is really the story of the day...,jim,35
48404,"Ok, so that's a disaster. Luckily have a two-part plan. One, run. Two, hide. It's pretty smart, right? [walks into Vance Refrigeration office] Hi, how you doing? I'm Jim Halpert from across the hall. We are redoing our supply closet and I was wondering if I could take a look at yours for some ideas.",jim,55
48406,"You absolutely should. He said it was ok, so till you get him, I'll just be in, you know. [closes door behind him to supply closet]",jim,26
48408,Ugh! He's always one step ahead of us! How does he do that?,andy,13
48411,"[Singing as if he were the dolls in his office] Christmas tiiiime is heeeere! [Normal voice] Wow. Thanks guys, that sounded amazing. Hi, I'm Andy Bernard and I am the first office Santa ever to make holiday wishes come true.",andy,40
48412,Who's excited to get their holiday wishes?,andy,7
48414,"What's that, Stanley?",andy,3
48416,It is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party.,andy,14
48418,I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.,jim,18
48421,"Fulfilled! Brought my bicycle, so I can be your designated driver later. In the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required.",andy,26
48422,What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?,dwight,17
48423,"That, I cannot do, but I did get you an acre of property on the moon.",andy,16
48424,Where? Dark side or light side?,dwight,6
48425,Light side.,andy,2
48426,Is it by the Sea of Tranquility?,dwight,7
48427,"As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent....beachfront.",andy,8
48428,"Thank you, Andy.",dwight,3
48429,"So, who's wish is next? Oh, what about Santa's wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica....C'mon guys, Jessica?...Jim, tell 'em who Jessica is.",andy,29
48430,"She's not your grandmother, is she?",jim,6
48431,"Ugh! Gam-gam's name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time?",andy,16
48432,Yeah.,jim,1
48433,"Jessica is my super serious girlfriend, who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing that's not serious, by the way? Our repartee.",andy,23
48435,"Totally out of your league. So in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to Jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault, and don't go near Gam-gam.",andy,30
48452,"Well you came to the right place....Ah, this, this party'll cheer you right up.",andy,14
48454,"Oh, thank you.",andy,3
48455,"Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat. [puts on baseball cap that has a foam rear-end on it with the words 'HARD ASS'] But, this is serious. It's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.",andy,54
48456,Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.,dwight,10
48457,It wasn't me.,jim,3
48458,It wasn't either of you.,andy,5
48459,Kathy wants to leave our clump?,jim,6
48460,Sh sh sh sh! Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.,andy,28
48461,"I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. [punches Jim in the arm]",dwight,38
48462,"Ow, What are you doing? [Jim fights back]",jim,8
48463,Hey! Hey! Respect the hat!,andy,5
48464,Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.,jim,9
48465,Alright. I'm gonna speak in a language you both understand....Mo-nay.,andy,10
48466,What was that?,jim,3
48467,What is it?,dwight,3
48468,"Money....You both have sizable Christmas bonuses coming your way. If I catch either of you messing with the other, I will give both bonuses to the other person.",andy,28
48469,Can't do that.,jim,3
48470,"No, absolutely not.",dwight,3
48471,You need consequences. OK? I want you both walking on eggshells.,andy,11
48477,"My ex is meeting my sex....which is always scary, you know? And not just because you think they might talk about your penis...that's just part of it.",andy,27
48478,"Hey! Jess, Erin, I hope you're not talking about my penis. [laughs and kisses Jessica on the cheek] Hi.",andy,19
48480,"Hey everyone! I want you to meet Jessica, she is an assistant cross country coach at Bryn Mawr.",andy,18
48482,"Erin, by the way, amazing receptionist.",andy,6
48485,What?,andy,1
48488,Oh no.,andy,2
48490,"Ut oh, it's kicking in. Spontaneous scoliosis.",andy,7
48507,Ah...[sees Dwight's wallet and open email] I'm gonna s- [see's Dwight watching from break room],jim,15
48508,"Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink.",jim,25
48528,"[on phone] Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.",jim,43
48529,"So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.",jim,25
48530,[laughing] Boom!,dwight,2
48543,Edgy impressions.,andy,2
48545,How many drinks have you had tonight? I can't be driving everybody home.,andy,13
48547,Whoa! Maybe you should take a break.,andy,7
48549,Ah! I've been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!,dwight,15
48551,"Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!",dwight,39
48552,"I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?",jim,11
48553,Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?,dwight,17
48554,Hmm...,jim,1
48559,Hello? Lacerated hand here folks.,dwight,5
48560,"Nice try, this is ridiculous.",jim,5
48561,Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.,dwight,21
48562,Three times.,jim,2
48563,You see?,dwight,2
48564,"Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it.",andy,8
48565,"Andy, you've gotta be kidding me.",jim,6
48568,"OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control...",jim,11
48569,Might wanna run that by Angela cause it's so cute.,dwight,10
48571,"[on phone] Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.",jim,23
48572,Come down right away!,dwight,4
48573,"[on phone]Uh, I don't know, let me ask. [to Dwight] Uh, were you quilled?",jim,14
48574,"Yes, I was quilled.",dwight,4
48575,And what's it's name?,jim,4
48576,Henrietta.,dwight,1
48577,Oops. [hangs up],jim,3
48578,"What? ...Alright, get her out of here, Dwight.",andy,8
48582,OK!,andy,1
48585,"Um, yeah, she's not always like that. It's um...",andy,9
48587,"Yeah, uh, excuse me.",andy,4
48589,Yep. [leaves Jessica to talk to Erin] Hey!,andy,8
48591,Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes?,andy,9
48593,OK...maybe I should make you some oatmeal or something.,andy,9
48596,"Ah, OK.",andy,2
48598,"That's not what it should be, it should just be like a trinket or something.",andy,15
48600,"You you, wait. You mean you wish she wasn't here or something.",andy,12
48602,"Hey, you know, you can't say that, OK? That's my girlfriend that you're talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it! Take your wish back.",andy,32
48609,I swear...,andy,2
48611,I was too embarrassed! [group laughs],andy,6
48612,"Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk. [shows picture of Cici with devil doodles] Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?",jim,31
48614,Yes. It is.,jim,3
48615,Um.,andy,1
48617,Cici is Jim's daughter.,andy,4
48619,"I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.",jim,25
48621,I don't-,jim,2
48622,I know who did this....Dwight.,andy,5
48624,Yeah.,jim,1
48625,Dwight.,andy,1
48628,Yeah. He is gonna pay. This is fire-able.,andy,8
48629,O...K.,jim,1
48630,"It's, I mean.",andy,3
48631,"Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it's a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like...",jim,51
48633,Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.,jim,12
48636,"I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.",jim,11
48637,"Enough of this garbage. [harshly places boom box on table and hits play] This is Christmas. [Christmas Eve by Trans-Siberian Orchestra plays. Dwight plays air violin/guitar and sings along] Hi-yah!!!!! [gabe, Creed and Nate join in as shots show various gift giving] Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!!",dwight,44
48638,"You alright, Santa?",jim,3
48639,"You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it's like, hey, can they stay friends?",andy,18
48640,Yes.,jim,1
48641,Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends?,andy,13
48642,"Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.",jim,13
48643,"No...I don't, hmm, I don't know.",andy,6
48644,OK.,jim,1
48645,"By the way, I'm not gonna mess with you and Dwight's bonuses. I think it's causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work.",andy,33
48646,Alright. I will definitely do that.,jim,6
48647,"Alright, I'll tell Dwight.",andy,4
48648,"You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway.",jim,17
48649,Christmas miracles do happen.,andy,4
48650,Yes. They totally do.,jim,4
48679,OK great.,andy,2
48681,Perfect.,andy,1
48683,"I would, it just, that wasn't the holiday wish.",andy,9
48687,"OK, bye. [helps Meredith off the floor] Alright Meredith,",andy,9
48689,You bet.,andy,2
48690,"Thank god Erin's getting a ride home with Robert because she is trashed. [laughs] and who better to drive her home than Robert, I mean, what a stand up guy, you know? I mean he's going through a lot, separating from his wife, showing up to the Christmas party in a track suit and a blazer,",andy,56
48691,"Let's go, let's go.",andy,4
48693,Hang on.,andy,2
48695,What?,andy,1
48697,What is all that?,andy,4
48699,It's junk!,andy,2
48701,You're a hoarder. My god!,andy,5
48703,Ah! My Santa suit's stuck.,andy,5
48704,"[laughs while spray painting 'Jim is Awesome' on his own car, talks to porcupine in carrier] What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh?",dwight,28
48706,"Sh, sh, sh, sh, shh.",andy,5
48708,Oh my god.,andy,3
48710,"Meredith, shut your drunk hole right now.",andy,7
48714,I'm sure I am not. Let's get you home.,andy,9
48716,Whoo.,andy,1
48717,"[yawns, 'Idiot' is written on his forehead] Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How's it goin?",dwight,25
48719,"Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at?",dwight,21
48720,"Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something......C'mon, Jim. [shakes head] I got nothin'.",jim,15
48722,"Oh, uh. Well, we thought we wouldn't put the alcohol out till 11AM. It's just...common...decency.",andy,15
48733,"It's come to my attention that someone, who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.",andy,16
48734,Cathy wants to leave our clump?,jim,6
48735,Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.,andy,24
48736,Hey. Enjoy your new clump.,dwight,5
48738,"It's so much closer to the bathroom, right?",dwight,8
48740,Uh huh.,dwight,2
48741,Sorry it didn't work out. Hope you find what you're looking for.,jim,12
48743,That's ok.,jim,2
48744,You'll be fine over there.,dwight,5
48746,"That'd be great, thank you. [Erin throws package, it hits Kathy. She thinks it was Jim who threw it]",jim,19
48747,"So, I got this bucket from Jim's garage and I filled it with everything disgusting. Except excrement. I can't wait to see the look on his face when that falls on my face. [laughs, then camera shows bucket being dumped on Kathy] Dammit Kathy!",dwight,44
48748,"For the past month, I have been collecting wishes from everyone in the office, and I intend to make good on every single one of them.",andy,26
48749,"Oh, I see.",andy,3
48750,"Now look, I may not have a great laugh like Santa, or a flying sled. But tell you what I do have. A Prius, a heart of freaking gold....",andy,29
48752,"Alright, you got it.",andy,4
48753,...and an American Express green card.,andy,6
48754,"Ryan, for your holiday wish, you wanted ten sick days.",andy,10
48756,Well I'll do you one better.,andy,6
48758,I got you health insurance.,andy,5
48760,"Yeah! Right? But with great perks come great responsibility, so I'm gonna be expecting a lot more from you...no more zoning out in your office.",andy,25
48762,Yes!,andy,1
48765,Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.,dwight,11
48768,"All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to.",jim,27
48769,It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person!,andy,10
48770,You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane.,dwight,17
48771,"Okay, done.",jim,2
48774,"All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-",jim,14
48775,"[writing on board] Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper?",andy,16
48776,You can write a book about chairs.,jim,7
48777,"Books! Excellent, Jim.",andy,3
48779,"[gasps] Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper? [scattered applause]",andy,28
48780,Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is.,jim,15
48781,"I'm talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Let's get high on our own supply!",andy,23
48783,Yes!,andy,1
48786,Dwight Schrute for Robert California!,dwight,5
48788,I'm not here to be given anything. I'm here to take what is mine.,dwight,14
48791,Gabe? You don't know?,dwight,4
48793,"Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office.",dwight,13
48796,Robert.,dwight,1
48798,Yes.,dwight,1
48800,Very good.,dwight,2
48801,"Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to 'play ball.' Those were his words.",andy,23
48803,So make that error!,andy,4
48807,"Well, it's just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it's a little more complicated than that.",andy,22
48809,"It's just, I really need a real accountant on this. [to Oscar] What do you say?",andy,16
48811,Oh.,andy,1
48813,What?,andy,1
48815,You know what? Go. Have fun.,andy,6
48816,There's a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia.,andy,9
48817,Stop right there. I love it.,jim,6
48819,I didn't even say what it is.,andy,7
48821,In Philadelphia.,jim,2
48822,"But here's the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase...",andy,33
48823,That's a great idea.,jim,4
48825,Yeah? You like it?,andy,4
48826,Yeah.,jim,1
48827,All right.,andy,2
48828,"All right, good stuff.",jim,4
48829,"I'm so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, 'this sounds really stupid.'",andy,18
48831,There is one problem with this plan.,andy,7
48833,"We'd have to leave work, like, right now, to do this.",andy,11
48835,"Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy.",dwight,19
48837,Meat grinder.,dwight,2
48839,"You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic.",dwight,25
48841,But I can give you this pitch in one minute-,dwight,10
48844,Still an important position. Still a chief.,dwight,7
48850,"You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you.",andy,33
48852,I've got a quota to hit. I don't care how I hit it.,andy,13
48854,I thought it was a fun idea.,jim,7
48856,"Wait, what? Everyone in here is gay?",andy,7
48860,It says that I believe that my staff's intelligence and that I'm willing to try anything. [Oscar's friend walks up] Not anything.,andy,22
48862,"Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but it's winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves.",andy,36
48866,A-team.,andy,1
48867,Okay.,jim,1
48868,"All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except... [looks at Kevin, who has joined the A-team]",andy,14
48870,There's a table over here.,jim,5
48872,"Oh, we got this!",andy,4
48882,[sniffs] There's no fires within eight miles of here.,dwight,9
48884,"What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO's office on the phone this instant!",dwight,17
48888,"Jim, Darryl. Your time to shine.",andy,6
48889,Shawn Marion.,jim,2
48892,"Wrong, for so many reasons.",jim,5
48898,"Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes.",jim,6
48900,"You're my sports guys! You're ESPN, you're ESPN Classic, Ryan is MSNBC. I'm E!, TLC and Oxygen.",andy,17
48902,"So it's a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!",dwight,37
48904,Oh my God.,dwight,3
48906,"Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?",dwight,20
48908,What's with the smile?,dwight,4
48910,"And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.",dwight,18
48912,Take me to Robert.,dwight,4
48914,Take me to his house.,dwight,5
48916,You know where it is. Lead me there.,dwight,8
48918,"Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let's go.",dwight,15
48930,[claps] All right.,jim,3
48932,"So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no.",andy,30
48933,Which one is it?,dwight,4
48935,Robert! Robert California! Robert!,dwight,4
48965,[dances] Whoo! Yeah!,andy,3
48967,Go Einsteins!,andy,2
48970,No thank you.,dwight,3
48972,"Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle: A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, 'table for one?' How is this possible?",dwight,37
48974,"Yes, exactly. Riddle number two: Who is going-",dwight,8
48976,N... it's complicated.,dwight,3
48978,"It's a job interview, not a flea market.",dwight,8
48980,Yes.,dwight,1
48982,"Oh, come on!",andy,3
49001,Einsteins! Great work.,andy,3
49003,"You know what I thought would be fun? Is we do like uh, a switch-em-up maybe? Since only one of us needs to win, maybe I can get Kevin and Kelly and put together an all-star team?",andy,37
49006,"Alright. Well just stay focused, try to concentrate.",andy,8
49021,"Alright, if you're not going to help us out by buying our own paper, could you sell eight hundred dollars more paper than usual today? That would be amazing.",andy,29
49022,"Andy, it's the last day of the quarter. We've already called all our clients, so making that much in a day is going to be tough.",jim,26
49023,"Not helping, tuna.",andy,3
49025,We gotta figure this out. Think of the look on Robert's face when we tell him we met our 8% goal.,andy,21
49027,"No, that's why...that's why I said think of it.",andy,9
49028,"Andy, we're gonna do our best. But you know what? At the end of the day seven point...whatever percent is pretty good.",jim,22
49031,Have I mentioned that it's also quite good for amateur animation? [flips crude animation of stick figures representing him and Robert] Took me two weeks.,andy,25
49032,"Oh, ugh. [stands and looks at meatball in chair] What is this, a meatball? Really? [Stanley laughs]",dwight,17
49034,"Jim, come on! That's so juvenile! What the- [opens drawer full of meatballs]",dwight,13
49036,Ugh.,dwight,1
49038,"Aw, man. [Stanley laughs] This is not very clever, Jim.",dwight,10
49039,I know.,jim,2
49041,[Dwight finds stapler in giant meatball] Really Jim? Really? Very funny.,dwight,11
49043,Thirty-two meatballs.,dwight,2
49045,That idiot's been feeding us for a week.,dwight,8
49050,Jessica! I love you! That's a message from my mom.,andy,10
49052,"[Robert is looking at pictures of a house online] Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.",jim,22
49054,Big. Stupid. Pure chump bait.,dwight,5
49056,"You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent.",jim,12
49058,"I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke.",jim,9
49060,"I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.",jim,25
49062,"Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here.",andy,13
49064,"Well, please tell Susan we all say hi.",andy,8
49088,Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.,jim,19
49089,Oh.,andy,1
49090,DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.,jim,10
49092,"Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.",jim,15
49094,"I bet I should. [takes cell phone photo] That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you.",jim,17
49096,All right-,jim,2
49098,I must...,jim,2
49100,"[hides ring] Yeah, it's pretty serious poolage.",andy,7
49102,Hmm? Flicking a bug off my wiener. [they both laugh],andy,10
49104,"No, I'm good.",andy,3
49106,Hi.,andy,1
49108,It's great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage.,andy,7
49110,"Well, I can't. I'm going skiing with Jessica. you know, a couple of dopes on the slopes.",andy,17
49112,No. What?,andy,2
49121,"All right, theres- this would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath.",andy,14
49123,Okay.,andy,1
49125,In a minute. In a minute.,andy,6
49127,A minute would be cool.,andy,5
49129,What-,dwight,1
49131,I'm relaxing. Scram. [pushes her],dwight,5
49133,"Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants?",andy,8
49135,"Where... [finds pants, looks for ring]",andy,6
49137,Oh really?,dwight,2
49139,"Yeah, you want to play you little hick? [kicks her in to the pool, Erin screams]",dwight,16
49154,"Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical.",jim,16
49156,Really? Why?,jim,2
49159,"[laughs] You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?",dwight,8
49161,I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it. [he picks her up],dwight,29
49164,You stop.,dwight,2
49166,"No, you stop.",dwight,3
49168,"Okay, you can stop.",dwight,4
49170,"No, you can stop.",dwight,4
49176,Good night.,jim,2
49190,"[he and Erin feed each other chips] Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah...",dwight,37
49192,Damn it.,dwight,2
49194,We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.,dwight,10
49199,Chicken fight!,dwight,2
49200,No thanks.,andy,2
49202,"Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight!",dwight,4
49205,Yeah- oh!,dwight,2
49207,Woohoo! Yes!,dwight,2
49209,I know. I could just bang you right now.,dwight,9
49212,To both these bears.,jim,4
49219,"Kelly, that's a crazy ring you found.",andy,7
49221,I can't believe you're wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all?,andy,12
49223,"The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly?",andy,17
49226,"You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund.",andy,16
49237,Yeah!,andy,1
49238,[to Erin] Maybe we should take a little break.,dwight,9
49240,Okay.,dwight,1
49242,Yeah!,andy,1
49245,Go!,dwight,1
49248,Yay! [Erin comes back up] Whoa!,andy,6
49250,I cannot believe you're still up!,andy,6
49253,"[muffled] Dwight are you okay? Hey, damn it-",andy,8
49254,"[coughs up water] Erin, did we win?",dwight,7
49256,You're lying. We didn't win.,dwight,5
49261,"Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday.",dwight,15
49262,"Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday.",andy,8
49263,"I know. [laughs] But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.",dwight,42
49264,Mmm.,andy,1
49265,"So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin.",dwight,17
49266,"Last I checked, I'm with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It's monogamy for my hog 'n me.",andy,21
49267,Not what I asked.,dwight,4
49268,We're done. Erin and I are over.,andy,7
49269,"So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex.",dwight,19
49270,Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out.,andy,12
49271,[sighs] You're an idiot.,dwight,4
49277,[Erin swims up with ring] Wow.,andy,6
49279,Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?,andy,10
49281,Duh.,andy,1
49283,"Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, it's not a special night.",andy,9
49285,"Honestly Erin, I don't know what I'm doing. I... I just... I don't know. Thank you.",andy,16
49288,To madness.,jim,2
49292,"Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?",jim,18
49294,Are you serious?,jim,3
49301,And there's my talking point.,jim,5
49311,Uh huh.,dwight,2
49313,Yeah....baby.,dwight,1
49315,Hey.,andy,1
49317,"Yeah, it sounds like it.",andy,5
49318,"Hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis?",dwight,8
49320,"No, seriously. Your spine is jacked. It's like the devil's cursive.",dwight,11
49322,You'd be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out...[pushes Erin back to floor],dwight,16
49325,"[Erin helps Dwight stretch his inner thighs] Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oooooh, yeah.",dwight,12
49327,Bring it on guys.,andy,4
49328,Yeah...,dwight,1
49329,Let's go before I vomit. [Erin and Dwight enter pool],andy,10
49330,Ready?,dwight,1
49333,Alright! Here we go.,andy,4
49335,RAHHH!!!!!!!,dwight,1
49337,Get her! Ruin her! [Andy and Jessica beat Dwight and Erin],dwight,11
49338,Hey! High-five!,andy,2
49344,To the shame room! [raises bottle],jim,6
49348,"Val, I need the space.",andy,5
49350,Everybody out.,andy,2
49352,I can't promise what I'm going to do or not do.,andy,11
49354,Obviously I'm going to clean up.,andy,6
49355,"Stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who's saying, 'Hey, we're uptight, you can't dance,' and then you have to be like, 'Oh yeah, Mayor Stress? Well watch this!' And then... we dance. Oh how we dance. [dances to Kenny Loggin's Footloose] Sex also works.",andy,47
49357,Hey! Tuna! He's back.,andy,4
49358,Hey.,jim,1
49359,"Oh, look at this. [hugs Jim] Tuna wrap.",andy,8
49360,Okay.,jim,1
49361,[grabs Jim's wrist] Hand roll.,andy,5
49362,Yeah.,jim,1
49364,"It was pretty uneventful, actually.",jim,5
49365,Can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.,dwight,18
49367,"Uh, hit and run.",jim,4
49370,Nope. Not guilty.,jim,3
49371,"Of course you found him not guilty. [mocking voice] 'Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm.'",dwight,22
49372,"We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.",jim,14
49373,"Not coming, have plans.",dwight,4
49374,Okay.,jim,1
49375,"I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.",jim,58
49388,"Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work.",jim,11
49395,"Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets?",andy,12
49396,"Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-",jim,8
49400,"Wow, I'm really sorry.",jim,4
49402,I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.,jim,24
49403,"[demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.",jim,33
49405,"Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too.",jim,9
49408,"I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants.",dwight,48
49424,"So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop...",dwight,23
49425,Mm-hmm.,jim,1
49426,And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?,dwight,22
49427,Mm-hmm.,jim,1
49428,"See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. [villainous laugh] Busted, Halpert!",dwight,23
49429,"Okay, wait, wait.",jim,3
49430,"Yes! Andy, get out here.",dwight,5
49431,No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.,jim,17
49432,I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights.,dwight,32
49433,"What's up, gangstas?",andy,3
49434,Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him!,dwight,30
49435,"Dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory.",andy,7
49436,I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-,dwight,10
49437,"No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill.",andy,15
49438,I don't- I don't need to take a chill pill.,dwight,10
49439,"Here, right there. [mimes giving Dwight a pill and a glass] Down the hatch.",andy,14
49440,I really don't want to take the chill pill. [mimes taking pill],dwight,12
49441,"Attaboy. Good. Now, chill.",andy,4
49442,"Okay, okay. [sits, exhales] But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?",dwight,22
49443,"Yeah, sure, of course. I'd fire him to Timbuktu. [Jim laughs nervously]",andy,12
49444,That's good enough for me. [exhales again],dwight,7
49445,"...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.",jim,36
49446,I feel terrible getting lied to. No one's ever lied to me before.,andy,13
49447,Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.,jim,19
49448,"No, not after what I told Dwight about firing you. No. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up?",andy,34
49449,No.,jim,1
49450,Do you know why you never heard of it?,andy,9
49451,No.,jim,1
49452,Covered it up.,andy,3
49453,Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?,jim,9
49454,They used to call me King Tut because I'm so good at keeping things under wraps.,andy,16
49455,"My nickname was actually King Butt, because I had a king-size butt.",andy,12
49457,"Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you. [indicates Ernesto and assistant who are carrying empanadas]",dwight,19
49463,"Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?",dwight,8
49464,Uh-,jim,1
49466,The empanada guy!,jim,3
49467,"No, Toby! [bleep] Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn't asking you. [sighs] Ask him if he remembers Jim. [Nate asks Ernesto a question in Spanish]",dwight,25
49470,"He says, 'No!' Boom!",dwight,4
49471,"Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients.",andy,17
49472,"Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world. [Ernesto says something in Spanish]",dwight,17
49474,"Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.",jim,17
49476,"Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?",dwight,17
49477,Why? Everybody's heard it.,andy,4
49478,Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?,dwight,12
49479,"Hey, Murder She Wrote. How about we drop the whole 'Murder, She Wrote' thing, okay? Jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there.",andy,34
49481,Why? Why? [looks at Jim],andy,5
49482,Because my car broke down.,jim,5
49483,"His car broke down. So he called me, 'cause I live near the courthouse.",andy,14
49484,"Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?",dwight,24
49485,"Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that.",andy,27
49487,We're getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down?,andy,14
49488,"Well, I think you handled it pretty well.",jim,8
49489,"I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I can't keep spinning gold out of your [bleep].",andy,13
49490,"Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth.",jim,27
49491,[sighs] I don't even know what the truth is anymore.,andy,10
49509,Funny? No? Nobody laughing?,jim,4
49510,"[laughs] You're screwed! Oh, it's happening. It's really happening.",dwight,9
49512,"Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.",jim,15
49513,Your clients. They're all mine.,dwight,5
49515,"Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die.",andy,14
49517,"Dwight, cut it out. I'm not firing Jim.",andy,8
49518,"No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-",dwight,10
49519,"I know what I said. Jim, you're in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I'm going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye. [gives Jim a limp slap]",andy,43
49520,That's it? This is crap! [dumps the box on Jim's desk and leaves],dwight,13
49522,"Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.",dwight,13
49523,"I'm gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best: stickle.",dwight,20
49540,"Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe?",dwight,6
49542,Okay. [sits],dwight,2
49544,Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.,dwight,21
49546,So don't.,dwight,2
49548,What?,dwight,1
49550,How long before?,dwight,3
49552,Yes I did.,dwight,3
49555,I want to see the baby.,dwight,6
49557,"Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions... [whispers] willingly, or as slaves.",dwight,22
49558,"That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose sex, that baby is mine.",dwight,15
49564,[to Cece] You want a giraffe?,jim,6
49565,"Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.",jim,23
49566,"Hi. Wow, I really thought I'd be more excited to be here.",pam,12
49567,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.",jim,8
49568,"Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, it's great to see you!",pam,10
49569,"Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think.",jim,8
49570,"Oh, hi Stanley.",pam,3
49571,Split the difference?,jim,3
49572,Jim.,pam,1
49573,"Okay, let's go.",jim,3
49574,Hey.,pam,1
49576,Hi everybody!,pam,2
49577,What?,jim,1
49579,How about a little visit?,pam,5
49580,"Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.",jim,14
49582,"Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip.",pam,16
49583,"Aw! You guys. He's licking on my finger, just like my cat does.",andy,13
49585,"No, it's the pacifier's turn.",pam,5
49587,Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?,jim,13
49588,"[gasps] Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat.",pam,27
49590,"No, but that would've been a really good idea.",pam,9
49591,That was a great idea.,jim,5
49592,"No, she brought you drawings.",pam,5
49593,"Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.",jim,20
49594,Oh!,andy,1
49595,"Oh, Aunt Phyllis.",jim,3
49597,"Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these?",andy,9
49599,"She says 'no' to everything. You know, she thinks my name is 'No.' Cece, do you want some broccoli?",pam,19
49601,No. It's crazy.,pam,3
49603,There's cross-hatching in some of these. That's kind of advanced for a two-year-old.,andy,13
49607,"Hey, Cece, why don't you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style?",andy,22
49608,"You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?",jim,33
49610,Shh.,pam,1
49611,I don't know what else we can do here.,jim,9
49613,It's okay.,jim,2
49614,"Oh, it's okay, sweetie.",pam,4
49615,"All right, all right. Okay.",jim,5
49616,"It's okay, honey. [Philip cries] It's okay, it's okay.",pam,9
49617,"All right, I know, I know. Let's just get this.",jim,10
49618,Shh.,pam,1
49620,"Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me.",dwight,11
49622,Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?,dwight,13
49624,Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.,dwight,5
49625,You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-,dwight,8
49627,"-and I said, 'I bet I could fulfill you,' and you said, 'I'd like to see you try,' and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.",dwight,30
49629,And then I inserted my penis-,dwight,6
49631,Into your-,dwight,2
49633,Vagina and-,dwight,2
49635,Admit that there is a chance.,dwight,6
49637,Admit it. Admit it.,dwight,4
49640,Yeah.,dwight,1
49643,"Before I go, may I?",dwight,5
49645,"Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision.",dwight,12
49647,I just might be his father.,dwight,6
49649,"[Philip is crying] I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?",jim,17
49651,"Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?",jim,11
49652,"I'm looking, I'm looking for the pacifier.",pam,7
49653,Cece!,jim,1
49654,"Okay, we're going.",pam,3
49655,"Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we're going home, we're going home. We're going home, we're going home. I know, I know, bud.",jim,24
49656,"Shh, shh, shh.",pam,3
49657,"I know, I know.",jim,4
49658,You want to grab her?,pam,5
49659,"I'm gonna grab her, okay.",jim,5
49660,"Here we go, here we go.",pam,6
49661,"Hi, all right. I'm just going to go down to the car and I'm going to put her in her seat and I'll be right back up.",jim,27
49663,"No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back.",jim,8
49667,Jim.,pam,1
49669,"Hey, we'll be just fine.",andy,5
49670,"Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let's go.",jim,9
49671,"Oh, whew!",andy,2
49672,"Dwight, what the hell? You can't smoke in here.",andy,9
49673,"Oh, right. [sighs] The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe.",dwight,17
49675,"Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.",dwight,11
49676,"Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?",dwight,31
49677,"I would love for everyone to just forgive me. But, if that's not happening, I'm not averse to just buying them all off.",jim,23
49678,"Alright guys. You know how we all like the red licorice but it's always buried behind like a ton of black licorice? [points to pile of candy] Bought it all. Now it's like red city in there. So, enjoy it.",jim,40
49680,So you effectively spent what...four dollars on the entire office?,andy,10
49681,"Uh, I can't get a handle on it. Am I cheap or rich? I can't...",jim,15
49682,You're nothing. When I think about all the gas money I spent on you. Washing my car to make sure you-,andy,21
49683,"[interrupting] Alright. Well, enjoy the red licorice, and good riddance, right? [tosses black licorice into trash]",jim,16
49685,"It's not really food, right?",jim,5
49687,"Ok, ok, ok.",jim,3
49689,'And shove it up my butt.',jim,6
49692,I'm not gonna eat it.,jim,5
49694,I'm not-,jim,2
49696,"[on phone] They hate me, Pam.",jim,6
49697,They don't hate you.,pam,4
49698,"No, it's bad. Darryl canceled go-karting....",jim,6
49699,When were you going go-karting with Darryl?,pam,7
49700,It's a lunch thing.,jim,4
49701,"Alright. Just don't worry, we'll figure this out.",pam,8
49702,I feel like a stranger in my own country.,jim,9
49703,"Ok, drama.",pam,2
49704,"Ok. Well, hey, you're not here. You don't know, Ok? It's intense. They made me eat black licorice.",jim,18
49706,"Everyone, this is Officer Foley from the Scranton PD. Works down at the courthouse. I think he has something he's like to say.",andy,23
49710,No.,andy,1
49714,That is so offensive and ridiculous. I-,andy,7
49718,"Ho hah!....oh, shoot.",andy,3
49720,Oh ho! Look who's back reporting for duty.,jim,8
49721,Hey guys!,pam,2
49723,[laughing] Hi.,pam,2
49724,Pam! Ahh! Look what I can do now that she's no longer pregnant. [pretends to punch Pam in the stomach] Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!,andy,24
49726,"Yeah. Yeah, I mean I could have used another week, or three.",pam,12
49728,"[laughing] Well, it's not exactly a vacation.",pam,7
49730,What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago.,dwight,18
49732,What?!,pam,1
49737,"Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts. You're allergic to walnuts, right Kevin?",pam,21
49739,Aw. It's OK Angela. I have mommy brain too.,pam,9
49741,When did you find time to do all this?,pam,9
49743,Thank you. [takes bite] Oh my gosh. It's really good.,pam,10
49745,"So you guys, you know what's an even more useful treat...is cash. So-",pam,13
49746,Nope. It's over.,jim,3
49747,...we wanted to say thank you-,pam,6
49748,Nope. OK.,jim,2
49749,"Dwight, I have exciting news for you.",andy,7
49750,What?,dwight,1
49751,I think you're going to like it.,andy,7
49752,You can't tantalize me.,dwight,4
49753,"Oooh, maybe I can. [slowly] I got an email... from corporate....that told me that...",andy,14
49754,OK. [looks at watch and leaves],dwight,6
49755,That...[quickly] you got a promotion! [Dwight turns back] Right? I mean that's not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.,andy,23
49756,"If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear.",dwight,12
49757,"No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores.",andy,26
49758,"Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!",dwight,17
49761,And here's some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes.,andy,25
49763,"Yeah, it's weird that I said that last one.",andy,9
49765,"Uh yeah, look at that.",andy,5
49767,"Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later.",andy,18
49772,"Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks.",dwight,41
49773,Really?,pam,1
49774,Mm hm.,dwight,2
49775,I'll fly anywhere for some good barbeque.,pam,7
49776,"Ooh, me three.",jim,3
49777,"Eh! No plus one's. This is for competent workers only. And don't worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill.",dwight,21
49778,Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about?,pam,14
49779,"God, you're such a spy.",dwight,5
49801,"My first task as special project manager Dwight Shrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People who'll help me get an inroad with the gay Hispanic community. People who won't be missed. We don't need idiots, good for nothing's, methheads or... What's your name?",dwight,48
49803,Kathy.,dwight,1
49804,I just got a text from Robert California that says 'bring your clubs to Florida'.,jim,15
49805,Why? Does he think you're going to Florida?,pam,8
49806,I hope not. [laughs] Because I am not going. Two question marks?,jim,12
49807,"No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know it's like wha-what?? Just do one.",pam,19
49808,"You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?",andy,9
49809,Yes.,dwight,1
49810,Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps?,andy,16
49811,Oh my god.,dwight,3
49812,"They're not expendable exactly, I just can't...I can't think of the word I'm trying to find.",andy,16
49813,Are you kidding me?! I'm supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We'd never get off the runway.,dwight,20
49814,"Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here's your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you're also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin.",andy,33
49815,Oh god.,dwight,2
49816,You have your team.,andy,4
49817,Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf.,dwight,36
49818,"Well, let's hear it.",pam,4
49819,"'Robert, Hey!' Exclamation point.",jim,4
49820,I like it so far.,pam,5
49821,"'Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA' Dash JH.",jim,16
49822,"It's perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida.",pam,10
49823,"Yeah, it's a golf text.",jim,5
49824,Total golf text. Send it.,pam,5
49825,Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.,jim,11
49836,"May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?",dwight,21
49838,"Oh, no big deal. It's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida.",dwight,26
49841,"Oh, I'm sorry Stanley, I can't share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you.",dwight,17
49844,"I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons.",dwight,29
49846,"I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.",dwight,29
49848,"Good point. But we're gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan.",dwight,29
49850,"It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out. [knocks on Andy's office door] Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you.",dwight,28
49851,Mooshie mooshie. [Dwight laughs],andy,4
49852,"Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify?",dwight,25
49853,Well uh...well the deliberations were confidential so...I feel like we should respect that.,andy,13
49859,Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby.,dwight,15
49860,"Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys!",andy,17
49862,I use the word 'guys' a lot when I'm nervous...guys.,andy,10
49863,Guys! Guys! Guys!,andy,3
49865,Guys..,andy,1
49868,Dudes...the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me.,andy,13
49869,OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.,dwight,17
49870,Wha-,andy,1
49872,"OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I'm happy to hear you out.",andy,36
49873,"Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it.",dwight,37
49874,No. That is a ridiculous waste of time.,andy,8
49876,Five to six hours?,andy,4
49877,Three to four hours.,dwight,4
49878,No no no no.,andy,4
49879,Two to three hours...,dwight,4
49880,Nope.,andy,1
49881,Come up with a statement in the next hour....,dwight,9
49882,Thirty minutes!,andy,2
49884,"Ok, read it back to me.",pam,6
49885,"[reading text] Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.",jim,32
49886,Good. Doesn't sound pushy...you're just stating a fact.,pam,8
49888,"Ok, sending.",jim,2
49889,Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning.,pam,10
49890,Really did [Text bleep] He responded L-O-L.,jim,7
49894,"I have already picked my team: Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. What's that? It's not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that's all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving.",dwight,45
49896,Or both?,andy,2
49898,Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.,andy,10
49899,"Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat.",dwight,13
49901,"Ok. Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know.",dwight,8
49902,Thank you.,andy,2
49904,Thank you.,andy,2
49906,"Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA: sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby.",dwight,14
49908,"Yeah, wow. It's almost like we're not all experiencing the same winter?",andy,12
49910,Maybe it's what she does here...,dwight,6
49911,Well...,andy,1
49913,"Erin, you wanna go to Tallahassee?",andy,6
49915,You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.,dwight,39
49917,Well it wouldn't be hard to find someone to fill in..,andy,11
49919,"Now, is it too dark to say that Cici's having an operation?",jim,12
49920,I think you need to go to Florida.,pam,8
49921,I think you're right.,jim,4
49922,"It's only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house it'll be..",pam,17
49923,Total nightmare.,jim,2
49924,I was going to say good because I'll have all the help I need?,pam,14
49925,"Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone.",jim,25
49926,Exactly.,pam,1
49927,"Well, [Jim enters] No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?",dwight,17
49928,"Tuns, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here, I can't let you go.",andy,16
49929,I wouldn't say that...it's a bit much.,dwight,7
49930,"You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go.",jim,31
49931,Jim is essential to th-,dwight,5
49932,"Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone]",jim,11
49933,"Andy, Jim is just too...essen-...",dwight,5
49934,Essential.,jim,1
49935,This is stupid! Cut.,dwight,4
49936,"Alright, I'm gonna pack my trunks.",jim,6
49937,He doesn't even want to go.,dwight,6
49938,"Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates.",jim,20
49939,Oh my god.,dwight,3
49940,"Hey, quick question: Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you're showering. Save some water.",jim,22
49941,"OK, listen up everyone, here's who's going to Florida: Kathy..",andy,10
49942,What?,dwight,1

49950,"You've gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team. [goes into conference room and slams door] AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!",dwight,22
49951,"Let's go, step it up you runts. You infants, let's move.",dwight,11
49955,"But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?",dwight,20
49957,"Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell. [holds up Taboo buzzer]",dwight,23
49958,Is that the buzzer from Taboo?,jim,6
49959,"SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.",dwight,15
49960,How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance?,dwight,9

49965,[Sighs and grunts] Orientation is over.,dwight,6
49982,"Ok, Florida team, let's reconvene.",dwight,5
49984,So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate.,dwight,15
49985,"So, what is this special project?",jim,6
49986,Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.,dwight,25
49987,That sounds awesome.,jim,3
49988,"It did, it did.",dwight,4
49991,"Oh, I like it.",dwight,4
49993,No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.,dwight,28
49995,"Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?",jim,14
49996,[long pause] Yes. What are my expectations for the group?,dwight,10
49997,"I have been given the responsibility to manage Stanley, a solid player, Ryan, who is capable of surprises, Erin, an excellent follower and Kathy, a probably not totally useless enigma. And, well, Jim. Under the right manager, that's not a bad team. Perfectinschlag.",dwight,43
50002,Alright [kiss],pam,2

50615,"Come on, man.",jim,3
50617,"Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.",dwight,11
50619,"Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid.",dwight,23
50623,"Perfect casting, right?",dwight,3
50626,"Speaking of pimples, let's release the BLOGGERS!",dwight,7
50627,"Morning, everyone.",andy,2
50629,Don't care. Tell me later.,andy,5
50631,What do you got?,andy,4
50634,"Yes, I do. Phyllis.",andy,4
50636,What?,andy,1
50642,"Here's what happened. Pam and I were arriving for the day. And there was a gang in the parking lot on bikes, on, on motorcycles. And they were just hassling Pam'",andy,31
50643,That's true.,pam,2
50644,"They had, uh' weapons.",andy,4
50645,Weapons.,pam,1
50646,I just stepped in to talk some sense into them.,andy,10
50647,But these were not the kind of people who use their words.,pam,12
50648,"Punches were going, and I ducked a few, landed a couple, and I was fighting them off. It was totally, like, like, senseless crime.",andy,24
50649,Thank goodness he was there.,pam,5
50652,I didn't do anything any of you wouldn't have done.,andy,10
50653,Open the gates! There's plenty for everyone. No need to panic. There's plenty for everyone!,dwight,15
50655,"There's plenty. Don't stampede. No need to stampede, sir.",dwight,9
50657,"Okay, okay. Hey, hey. It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. There's plenty of Pyramids.",dwight,16
50664,No.,andy,1
50666,"No, no, no, no, no, we don't need to call the police. They'll just ask everybody questions, get up in everyone's business, right, Pam?",andy,24
50667,Police are a hassle. We settled this on the street.,pam,10
50668,"And my eye will heal. But if the police come, then we will forever stain our neighborhood as a troubled area.",andy,21
50670,Because I have neighborhood Pride. 1-8-5-0-5.,andy,6
50671,1-8-5-0-5.,pam,1
50675,"Exactly. We need to feel safe, which is why' Toby is giving us self defense training.",andy,16
50677,Right Toby? Will you teach us self defense?,andy,8
50679,Great.,andy,1
50683,"[on phone] Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?",jim,19
50686,"Uh, I - I gotta go. Okay.",jim,7
50688,"Oh, no, no, no. It's good. It's really -- on the Internet, it's a really -- that's a really good, good, thing.",dwight,22
50689,Are you trying to sabotage this entire event?,dwight,8
50690,I'm very sorry.,jim,3
50692,"I'm really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?",jim,14
50693,"You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck! ??Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.",dwight,38
50694,"Point it towards the store, idiot!",dwight,6
50695,[laughs] You know what I mean? One of these buttons is -- damn it. Take over.,dwight,16
50704,What if you're being attacked by a ' smallish man who happens to not have a groin?,andy,17
50706,What if you're being attacked by a 4'11' man who is penisless?,andy,12
50708,"Why don't we start with the basics? Show us how to defend ourselves against a baby, and then like, a fifth grade girl, and then, you know, if we have time, on up to a scary man.",andy,37
50710,"So in that scenario, what if the victim sucker-punches the attacker in the face? What can the attacker then do to better protect himself?",andy,24
50715,"[softly] Take that, kid.",andy,4
50716,"Cathy, I would like to introduce you to Fatty Gruesome. He is a freelancer for Wired magazine.",dwight,17
50718,"But you still work for Wired, right?",dwight,7
50720,Good! Okay. Flirt away.,dwight,4
50722,"Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous.",jim,14
50724,"Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen.",dwight,10
50726,You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.,dwight,15
50727,Dwight.,jim,1
50728,I'm trying to make him feel important.,dwight,7
50730,"Um... [imitating Kelly] Oh, Ryan, you're so smart. You're smarter than Mark Zuckerberg and those Google guys all combined. Hee hee hee.",dwight,22
50732,What's a book? [giggles],dwight,4
50734,[ahem] You can... [slightly effeminate] You can do it Ryan.,jim,10
50736,"You're the only one who can do it, s-sweetie.",jim,9
50738,"I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --",jim,13
50740,"Jim, get him a water.",dwight,5
50742,Why are you just standing there? Go to a nearby store and get him a yellow or green sports drink!,dwight,20
50745,[deep voice] I think you guys might have the wrong Office.,andy,11
50753,I just had a baby.,pam,5
50755,Wow.,pam,1
50758,How 'bout we wait til next year after you have your kid?,pam,12
50760,"[deep voice] Listen, I don't know what you guys are talking about, but I guess I'll just accept your apology so we can get on with our day.",andy,28
50767,Oh... [Kelly laughing],andy,3
50768,Have you seen Erin?,dwight,4
50770,Oh God... ??Hey no! Where do you think you're going? You've gotta stay for the big presentation we've got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. He's like an even more handsome Bill Gates.,dwight,33
50772,It's moments away. Just stay here!,dwight,6
50785,How long has he been in the bathroom?,dwight,8
50786,About ten minutes.,jim,3
50787,Jeez! What's he doing in there? [cell phone vibrates],dwight,9
50788,"Oops, that's my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?",jim,16
50789,Are there any bloggers around?,dwight,5
50790,It's Ryan. 'I'm sorry. I lied. I'm not in the bathroom. I can't do it. I need to see my mom. I'm going home.',jim,24
50792,"I had to send him home. As brilliant and creative as he is, he is nothing... compared to this guy!",dwight,20
50793,Uh...,jim,1
50795,That's right. Will you just give us a second?,dwight,9
50797,okay.,jim,1
50799,Jim --,dwight,2
50800,I'm not doing the Presentation.,jim,5
50801,"Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. I'm telling you... if you don't do this, [whispers] I don't stand a chance. Please, Jim.",dwight,47
50802,"Okay, I'll do it.",jim,4
50803,"Oh, my God. O... Kay! Go get into Ryan's costume and check out his notes.",dwight,15
50804,A costume?,jim,2
50805,"Of course there's a costume! [laughs] ??Oh, this is gonna be great. There's nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.",dwight,23
50806,Did you pass out in there? What is taking so long?,dwight,11
50807,I've been in here for 20 seconds.,jim,7
50808,Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner?,dwight,16
50809,I'm not wearing eyeliner.,jim,4
50810,"You are wearing eyeliner, Jim.",dwight,5
50812,It's true.,dwight,2
50813,"This... is the future, because... This is the past. I've been through a lot of issues in my life. I've seen drug addiction -- unemployment. I've been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain. [scattered applause]",jim,48
50814,Yep.,dwight,1
50817,Psst.,dwight,1
50818,Oh.,jim,1
50821,All right. ??Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night! [applause continues],jim,13
50822,Yeah. ??Thank you. Thank you.,jim,5
50842,"Hey, hey, hey. Kelly Kelly, Kelly... come on.... Ow! God! My good eye!",andy,13
50843,"[laughs] Oh boy. Oh no, I'm not laughing at you. I'm laughing at, um, something that Cece did on the playground earlier -- yesterday. This morning.",pam,26
50844,"You know why I got hit by girls? Because I stood up for others. Pam and for Toby. ??I stepped in and I didn't care that I was standing up to girls. You may wanna ask yourselves, 'Where were you when the girls came?'",andy,44
50845,"Tough day. Yes. But I feel good. I put the office in their place, took a bunch of pain killers, drank a half a bottle of wine, took my pants off. ??I just feel good!",andy,35
50846,"Okay, okay, I will be the first to admit it. ??We could have integrated more Chuck into the Presentation.",dwight,19
50848,"Ha, ha, ha, ha! Yeah!",dwight,5
50850,Okay! Come on!,dwight,3
50852,Hah! Yah! [kicking and punching the air] Boom!,dwight,8
50853,"[exiting office] Everyone stop what you're doing, I have terrible news. Dwight is no longer with us.",andy,17
50855,"He's gone, damn it! He's been promoted to VP of Sabre Retail and he's staying in Florida forever.",andy,18
50857,Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful.,andy,10
50859,How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke [slight pause] of good fortune and he is now in a better place.,andy,25
50863,I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. [everyone disagrees],andy,19
50865,"Yeah, I know, Oscar we all are but nobody's gonna open it. You'd have to be insane. [everyone turns to look at Creed]",andy,23
50867,"[to Creed standing in front of the 'treasure box'] Now, carefully... open the box.",andy,14
50869,"Aw, that's so sweet! [dart fires out of box and lodges in ceiling]",pam,13
50870,"[feigning surprise] A dart? Are you kidding me? Who would put a poison dart, well, I mean, I don't know that it's poison. I mean, I just have to imagine. God, I'm glad he's OK though. Kinda sounds like he deserved it, opening another man's treasure and all. Wow!",dwight,49
50871,"[on a golf course] Well, mister ball, it's been a pleasure. Now, give my regards to hell. Da! [hits ball]",dwight,20
50877,Ah!,dwight,1
50879,[to Robert] You think you're excited? You should feel my nipples. [Robert gives a fake laugh],dwight,16
50880,"Oh, that reminds me. [reaching into golf cart] Little something from all of us. [hand Dwight a small wrapped gift]",jim,20
50881,"[sarcastically] Oh my gosh, thank you Jim, that's so thoughtful. [sets gift on golf tee] Four! [smashes gift] Oh yeah!",dwight,20
50883,Don't even care!,dwight,3
50884,"This is the last time I'll ever see Dwight. It's a weird feeling, it's, um, what's the word? It's not, it's not bittersweet. It's uh... sweet. Yeah.",jim,27
50886,"Would if I could. And I can so I will. Put me down for one box. Don't care what it is, dealer's choice.",andy,23
50888,Damn it.,andy,2
50930,[to Dwight] All right. So... I guess this is it.,jim,10
50931,"Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But...[smiles] bye, bye. I win.",dwight,26
50932,"[attempts to shake Dwight's hand] Goodbye, Dwight.",jim,7
50933,"[drops golf ball into Jim's open hand] Robert, race you to the clubhouse, gentlemen's bet. Woohoo! [takes off in golf cart]",dwight,21
50934,"Well, he's Florida's problem now.",jim,5
50936,What's that?,jim,2
50938,I thought you liked the store?,jim,6
50940,Thank you.,jim,2
50942,"Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible.",jim,14
50944,"[from distanced golf cart] Robert! I'm gonna win, ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it!",dwight,15
50946,"[at Sabre headquarters] The math is simple folks. Deeper market penetration, plus greater visibility, will raise Sabre [Nellie emerges from behind Dwight] [together] to the power of two.",dwight,28
50949,[to Nellie] I told you.,dwight,5
50951,"You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper.",dwight,24
50952,[enters room] All right. There he is.,jim,7
50953,What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?,dwight,12
50954,Can I just talk to you for one quick second?,jim,10
50955,"What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'? [others laugh]",dwight,10
50956,"Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should- [gestures toward hallway]",jim,16
50957,"You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. [others laugh]",dwight,39
50959,[to Packer] Silence.,dwight,3
50961,"[interrupts] I know what you're trying to do, I don't want it. [to Jim] But your face does look like the guy from Operation.",dwight,24
50963,Different guy.,dwight,2
50964,"You know, I just think you should know that-",jim,9
50965,[interrupts] That you look like the world's tallest hobbit. [others laugh],dwight,11
50966,"Well, I tried. [gestures the meeting room] You saw it, so, it's on the record. I have a plane to catch.",jim,21
50974,"[video chat begins, Andy's head enters the screen from the side] Hello?",andy,12
50976,"Oh, now mine's broken. Hang on. [turns his laptop on its side while lying on desk] Oh, there we go.",andy,20
50977,"[on phone with Jim] He said, 'I did like Dwight'? He's gonna fire him.",pam,14
50978,"No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'.",jim,30
50979,Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.,pam,13
50980,I tried. He will not listen.,jim,6
50981,Did you actually try your hardest?,pam,6
50982,"Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. He's like super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up.",jim,33
50984,Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up.,jim,13
50985,"If Dwight's about to get fired, you have to tell him. Just get the words out. That's all you can do.",pam,21
50986,OK. All right.,jim,3
50996,Or have them sing that song! That the frog does in Looney Tunes.,pam,13
51000,No.,andy,1
51002,"I don't buy it. It, that is a freckle. That is not a tan, ok? I'm gonna have to inspect it in person when you get back here. I want you looking totally 'puerto ricania' when i see you.",andy,39
51004,What?,andy,1
51008,"Yeah, that's awesome. That's great.",andy,5
51019,[straightens tie in mirror] Showtime.,dwight,5
51020,[enters abruptly] Dwight.,jim,3
51021,"You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick.",dwight,19
51022,"OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me. [Dwight makes funny gesture] No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please?",jim,26
51023,"Yes, you may tell me one thing. Wait, you want to borrow money?",dwight,13
51024,Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store.,jim,11
51025,"[rolls eyes] Jim, come on.",dwight,5
51026,"Dwight, he's gonna kill the store.",jim,6
51027,Uh-huh.,dwight,1
51028,"And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it.",jim,11
51029,Wait. [holds up fingers] He's gonna kill the store? And he's gonna fire me?,dwight,14
51030,Yes.,jim,1
51031,[smiles] That's two things.,dwight,4
51032,"Dwight, please.",jim,2
51033,"Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today.",dwight,18
51034,"OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so-",jim,8
51035,You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.,dwight,28
51036,"Dwight, come o-",jim,3
51037,"Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah![Jim tackles Dwight]",dwight,48

51040,AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest.,dwight,15
51041,Gross!,jim,1
51042,[attempting to break from Jim's grasp] Ah!,dwight,7
51043,"What? What, what, what, what, what?",jim,6
51044,"[clutching side] Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix-",dwight,8

51050,[stops whining and charges Jim] Rrrah!,dwight,6
51057,I'm just dealing with Erin's stuff since apparently she's not coming back. And she didn't bother to tell anyone.,andy,19
51059,"Ryan, why didn't you tell me?",andy,6
51061,You never update it.,andy,4
51063,"Does anyone else think this is weird? And like, kind of uncool, actually? To leave us without a receptionist?",andy,19
51064,"We'll find another receptionist. I mean, that's easy. We'll be fine. [Andy nods reluctantly]",pam,14
51065,"[trying to get around Jim] Huh, huh, huh! [slides between Jim's legs]",dwight,12
51066,What are you doing?,jim,4
51067,I was trying to go-,dwight,5
51068,Get up.,jim,2
51069,"Ok, ok.",dwight,2
51070,Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by.,jim,10
51071,Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you.,dwight,13
51072,OK. [Dwight runs in place] What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.,jim,19
51073,[tries to jump off wall] Jackie Chan! [falls and groans],dwight,10

51093,Why?,jim,1
51094,Anything else you need to talk about?,dwight,7
51095,Nope. I think that was it. [Dwight gets up and walks away],jim,12
51096,"[looking disheveled in mirror] Once again, it's show time.",dwight,9

51120,"Well, I guess it doesn't look that cool either. But, it's been up there a long time, so it's become a pretty big deal.",pam,24

51141,What brings you to town?,jim,5
51143,What?,dwight,1
51144,How could Robert transfer Nellie here after the Sabre store debacle? She stinks of failure. The fact that she could show her face around here is an embarrassment. I should know. I'm in an identical situation.,dwight,36
51147,What?,pam,1
51149,You messed up saying your name?,pam,6
51152,"No, that's Andy's office.",jim,4

51213,How can you give us performance reviews if you don't know us?,pam,12
51218,"Well, we're not really dating anymore, so... basically, I mean, I just have to cross a few Ts and dot a few I's, you know.",andy,25
51221,"All right. Technically, yes, I am still technically dating Jessica. But when I realized that I wanted you back, I just jumped in the car and I drove down here, and I didn't want to stop until I saw you.",andy,40
51223,Any luck?,jim,2

51240,"What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job.",jim,12
51241,"What do you mean, take my job?",andy,7
51242,"Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.",jim,13
51243,"Okay... Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I'm not coming home without Erin. So I'll talk to you later.",andy,23
51244,"Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.",jim,31
51246,I like working here.,pam,4
51247,"Dwight, should she be our manager?",jim,6
51248,I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.,dwight,8
51249,"Those who can't farm, farm celery.",dwight,6
51250,And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? [clears throat],jim,15
51254,"I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.",dwight,31
51256,What?,dwight,1
51258,There's no limit to what I think I deserve.,dwight,9
51260,Five percent. No less.,dwight,4
51262,"Six percent, I know my worth.",dwight,6
51263,The raise isn't real.,jim,4
51264,Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard.,dwight,11
51266,Phyllis.,pam,1
51271,Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?,jim,10
51273,"Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis.",jim,7
51275,"Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry.",jim,26
51277,Yes.,jim,1
51279,"Oh, god, nature, please.",jim,4
51281,[exhales sharply],jim,2
51283,Was that not the--,jim,4
51285,Mm-hm.,jim,1
51287,"Was that it? No, that wasn't bad.",jim,7
51289,No. I would've said no.,jim,5
51292,"I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that.",jim,30
51293,"No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.",dwight,19
51295,Yes.,dwight,1
51297,Yes.,dwight,1
51299,Yes.,dwight,1
51301,Yes.,dwight,1
51303,"Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off.",dwight,12
51304,"[Darryl grabbing him by his hair, dragging him from office] Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.",dwight,18
51305,[panting] Well fought. I accept the outcome.,dwight,7
51308,"Yeah, if I had my own--",andy,6
51310,"--sorry, you go.",andy,3
51312,"Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other's mouth. It's just stupid. What were you going to say?",andy,35
51314,You broke my heart too.,andy,5
51316,I'm so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time.,andy,14
51318,[sighs],andy,1
51320,"Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager's position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I'm easy.",pam,20
51322,"Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?",pam,13
51324,"Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn't like a bottle.",pam,18
51326,No.,pam,1
51328,I think... you're a witch.,pam,5
51330,[drowsily] I'm amazing. [sighs],pam,4
51339,"No, it's not, because you don't really work here.",jim,9
51341,"Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises.",jim,13
51343,Yes.,jim,1
51345,No.,jim,1
51349,She dies.,jim,2
51351,Let's see it. Show of hands.,jim,6
51353,"All right, guys, stop.",jim,4
51355,How?,jim,1
51359,"That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin's favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm. [tosses it out car window] It's biodegradable. Animals will eat it.",andy,36
51361,Erin!,andy,1
51364,Okay.,andy,1
51366,"Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff.",andy,10
51368,Like your toothbrush and stuff.,andy,5
51370,You don't have a toothbrush?,andy,5
51372,How do you not have a toothbrush?,andy,7
51374,You just use whichever one is sitting there?,andy,8
51376,Of course. I own my toothbrush.,andy,6
51378,Hey Jim. Stanley's back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card?,pam,13
51379,"Oh, great. [reads] 'Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy.' Oh that's not good.",jim,17
51381,It's nice. It's funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.,pam,17
51382,Stanley doesn't have a moustache.,jim,5
51383,Yeah he does.,pam,3
51385,"Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?",pam,16
51387,Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!,pam,11
51388,"Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?",jim,16
51390,"Okay, which one of these looks more right? [holds up drawing of Stanley with and without a moustache]",pam,18
51391,"Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left.",dwight,28
51393,"Okay, quick. Who says moustache? [Pam, Oscar, Dwight, and Creed raise their hands]",jim,13
51394,Yep.,dwight,1
51395,"Who says no moustache? [Jim, Angela, and Phyllis raise their hands; Gabe enters, hiding Stanley's face]",jim,16
51398,Yes!,dwight,1
51399,"Welcome back, Stanley. [Stanley grunts]",pam,5
51401,Oh! [takes out earbuds],pam,4
51403,"Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.",pam,19
51424,"Okay, okay.",dwight,2
51431,Why Jim?,dwight,2
51433,"I'm sorry, we're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible?",pam,12
51434,"I'm sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment.",jim,15
51435,I'm still not sure why this woman is even here.,pam,10
51436,Why is she here?,jim,4
51437,[sings] Two crazy kids on the journey of life.,andy,9
51439,"On the road with my new girlfriend. But first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents' cabin in southern Pennsylvania.",andy,29
51441,Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy.,andy,12
51443,Oh. Hmm.,andy,2
51444,[sings] Time to have a little kiss!,andy,7
51446,Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official.,andy,10
51448,I believe in that.,andy,4
51450,"I think that's important. That is important. Bummer, but important.",andy,10
51452,Mm-hmm.,andy,1
51454,"I know, right?",pam,3
51459,Phyllis!,pam,1
51462,"...and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you.",andy,20
51464,Consider it nailed.,andy,3
51466,"Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm really sorry. I just need you to know-",andy,14
51468,I just need you to know-,andy,6
51470,[lifting box] Ugh! Ow.,dwight,4
51471,"Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door.",jim,25
51472,"Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? 'Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is.'",dwight,31
51473,That was one time-,jim,4
51474,I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.,dwight,13
51476,"[cell phone rings] Excuse me, one second. Hi.",jim,8
51477,"Hey, what's up?",pam,3
51478,"Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.",jim,8
51479,[shouting] Haulin' cube!,dwight,3
51480,That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.,jim,15
51481,"So we're planning this party for Nellie, and we're gonna make it really bad.",pam,14
51482,Sounds like every other party.,jim,5
51483,"No. We're gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.",pam,17
51484,Oh! Hire a magician.,jim,4
51485,What?,pam,1
51486,Trust me.,jim,2
51487,[laughs] Okay.,pam,2
51488,Wow. There's a lot of cars here. This is just weird.,andy,11
51490,"Hey, Lauren. Look at you.",andy,5
51492,"I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought I'd stop and say hi to Jessica.",andy,19
51494,"Why is Erin with me? That's a great question. She is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car.",andy,23
51497,Yep. This is Erin.,andy,4
51500,"Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just-",andy,20
51503,I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.,dwight,17
51504,"Yes, you should.",jim,3
51505,[finds shoe box] Ooh.,dwight,4
51506,"[reads] 'Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie.'",jim,7
51507,I have to see these shoes.,dwight,6
51508,I doubt that they're sh-,jim,5
51509,Oh!,dwight,1
51510,Whoa. Who is this guy?,jim,5
51511,Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend.,dwight,15
51512,Boyfriend.,jim,1
51513,Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend.,dwight,24
51514,Like a boyfriend?,jim,3
51515,You read my mind.,dwight,4
51516,Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.,jim,9
51517,Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician.,dwight,16
51518,Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.,jim,15
51520,"Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just...",jim,8
51522,Why not call...,dwight,3
51523,Shh!,jim,1
51525,That's awful. What kind of restaurant.,dwight,6
51526,Dwight!,jim,1
51528,I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.,jim,9
51529,"If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.",dwight,18
51531,"No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or...",jim,13
51533,"[in the phone] You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff.",jim,24
51534,"What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.",pam,27
51535,"No, that's not what I-",jim,5
51537,"Absolutely. Yeah. [whispers] Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.",jim,23
51538,"Oh, okay. Okay, I will. [hangs up phone]",pam,8
51542,Or what if...,pam,3
51544,"We discuss... [Angela and Phyllis giggle] the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party. [giggling stops] Not mean.",pam,25
51547,What are you talking about? Yes we can.,pam,8
51552,It'll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy penis?,andy,12
51554,These are delicious.,andy,3
51557,"Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don't know Matthew's history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life. [laughs] I don't know.  I just- I don't think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don't pop that one.",andy,57
51560,Hey.,andy,1
51563,"Oh! Ah, Megan.",andy,3
51565,Aww.,andy,1
51568,"Oh, he's out there.",andy,4
51570,"Well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so...",andy,14
51572,[singing] By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes...,andy,10
51573,"Okay, they're almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle? [rips down ugly photo of Nellie]",pam,26
51578,"No, that's a great idea. Let's have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?",pam,20
51581,Cause there's someone already here named Pam.,pam,7
51588,"No. I gotta do this. Hey Jessica, could I talk to you?",andy,12
51590,"Uh, maybe we could talk in private?",andy,7
51592,"Well, first just let me say that I hope when I'm done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends.",andy,23
51594,"Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now.",andy,23
51596,Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay.,andy,11
51598,"I am gay, and I prefer men.",andy,7
51600,"You did not, Kenny!",andy,4
51602,I like hanging out with you. You're a cool guy. Which proves my point. That I'm gay.,andy,17
51604,"Well, I was faking it. I had to fake it every time. I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos.",andy,26
51606,"Well... I mean, I was good at hiding it, but-",andy,10
51608,"Understandable. And I'm really sorry. I really am. [hugs Jessica, grunts] So... we should probably... go.",andy,16
51616,"Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.",jim,59
51620,No. No.,jim,2
51622,"Oh! [laughter, murmuring]",pam,3
51624,Right? Rough scene.,andy,3
51626,Oh... at least we can kiss now.,andy,7
51628,"You know, that stuff that I said about you to her... I did- That's just- I had to say it. You know, I was dating her at the time.",andy,29
51630,Yeah.,andy,1
51632,Oh yeah.,andy,2
51635,"Oh, I'll do it. I will volunteer.",jim,7
51637,I'll do it.,jim,3
51639,[picks a card] It's the four of hearts.,jim,8
51644,Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place.,jim,8
51646,"That's not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears.",pam,12
51648,"Okay scram, wizard.",dwight,3
51650,You heard me!,dwight,3
51657,"I just gotta do one thing. [leaves car, knocks on door]",andy,11
51660,"Hi. Super-duper honesty time. I'm not gay. In fact, I'm so not gay, I'm in love with a girl. Her name is Erin Hannon and she's right there. She's sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material.",andy,37
51665,Okay.,andy,1
51667,Bye guys.,andy,2
51675,Hey Hank.,pam,2
51677,I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician.,pam,13
51679,"Well, turns out he actually made it up there.",jim,9
51681,"Yeah, he came and went.",pam,5
51683,Let's just- let's go.,pam,4
51684,Night-night.,jim,1
51686,"Phyllis says the same twelve clich??s every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates.",jim,30
51696,"Just one. 'This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book.'",pam,17
51699,"You know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?",pam,14
51700,"Hey, come on.",jim,3
51702,And that's noon. Exactly. [others groan],jim,6
51704,[singing] My girlfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble-,andy,9
51706,...my girlfriend's back!,andy,3
51708,"Anyway, I know it's the end of the day. We just wanted to stop by and say hi.",andy,18
51711,"Hey, Kev.",andy,2
51713,Nice sweater.,andy,2
51715,What happened to old salty?,andy,5
51716,Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.,dwight,11
51717,"I've written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter.",dwight,37
51718,Okey dokey. [knocks on door],andy,5
51720,"Whoa. Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram I've been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard you've been hearing all about.",andy,25
51722,I just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence.,andy,17
51724,"Anyway, now that I'm back, I would love to have my office back, whenever you get a chance.",andy,18
51726,"Obviously, we'll figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all this stuff out of here. But, you know, the sooner the better.",andy,22
51728,Get back to normalcy.,andy,4
51731,"Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don't want to bother you any more than we already have.",pam,21
51732,That's it.,jim,2
51734,"Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl.",pam,20
51735,"Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, that's it.",jim,9
51736,Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew they'd be good together.,pam,14
51737,[talks over flashbacks] Kelly has been a handful in the past.,pam,11
51739,[Ryan and Kelly make out in the nook] But she's had a bad influence. She's like an addict. [Ryan and Kelly argue] And I just had to get her clean.,pam,30
51742,"Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby.",jim,12
51744,Don't shake our baby?,pam,4
51746,"Okay. I'd never heard that before. So, thank you.",pam,9
51748,"Yeah, I'm glad you said something.",pam,6
51752,"Yeah, they're really great together.",pam,5
51754,"That's about it, yeah.",jim,4
51758,This is what I was trying to tell you.,andy,9
51764,[chuckling] Okay.,andy,2
51766,You can't dock my pay-,andy,5
51769,"Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellie's pay a hundred dollars. Angela?",andy,15
51771,Angela?,andy,1
51773,"Ooh, she's counting again.",andy,4
51775,"Oh, oh!",andy,2
51778,"Seriously, Angela?",andy,2
51779,I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago.,andy,18
51782,You're just saying numbers. It's meaningless.,andy,6
51784,It's literally like-,andy,3
51788,"Oh, yeah, I was just tired.",andy,6
51790,"Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn't last night.",andy,26
51792,Yeah. I know it's not... a big deal.,andy,8
51800,Yes?,dwight,1
51802,How?,dwight,1
51804,"Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never.",dwight,29
51806,Okay?,dwight,1
51808,Washington Monument.,dwight,2
51810,Eiffel Tower.,dwight,2
51812,I saw you were getting along with Ryan again.,pam,9
51814,"Yeah, he's so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?",pam,14
51816,"I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming.",pam,43
51817,One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that.,dwight,49
51818,Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on.,dwight,26
51819,"Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that.",dwight,10
51821,"Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant.",dwight,58
51824,You can't call a meeting. [laughs] But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let's get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting.,andy,37
51826,Oh! Can't do it 'cause I gotta run a meeting. So.,andy,11
51828,Wanted to talk to all of you guys about [reads whiteboard] importance... and know that each and every one of you is vitally important.,andy,24
51833,"It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.",dwight,23
51843,"No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now. [thrusts his pelvis]",dwight,19
51847,"Fine, it was me. I couldn't- I had a problem with Erin last night. Happy?",andy,15
51848,I had a lot on my mind last night. And I didn't perform. Okay? It happens to plenty of guys. It's usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview.,andy,32
51849,Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. Tuna? T-dog?,andy,13
51850,Um...,jim,1
51853,Fascinating.,andy,1
51861,"Okay, so I-",andy,3
51862,"Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it.",pam,8
51863,What happened?,jim,2
51864,That a couple of times-,pam,5
51865,Couple of times.,jim,3
51867,Yeah Jim.,dwight,2
51868,"Yeah Jim, get it out there.",andy,6
51869,"Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had sex so many times already, I was exhausted...",jim,23
51870,"Okay, stop.",pam,2
51871,I was very drunk.,jim,4
51879,"You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it.",dwight,18
51882,"Wow, what are we talking about?",jim,6

52533,"Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them.",dwight,14
52534,"I know why you're doing this, Dwight.",jim,7
52535,"Last week, I may have gone too far. I'll explain it quickly. Basically, I found out where he gets his clothes dry-cleaned. Custom ordered the same suit, made with tear-away Velcro. And... you can fill in the rest.",jim,38
52536,"[Jim rips off his clothes] Wha-? [Stanley laughs] Damn it, Jim!",dwight,11
52537,Now he's trying to get me to bring my children in to work. I think it's fair to be cautious.,jim,20
52550,[wearing janitor outfit] Hi guys.,andy,5
52551,"How's it going, man?",jim,4
52552,"[whimpering] I'm- I'm good, thank you. And how are you?",andy,10
52553,"Great, yeah, good.",jim,3
52556,"Look, I'm not here to get my old job back. I had my opportunity, I blew it, I'm moving on. I just wanted to come in here and literally beg you for something, anything. I will sweep the floors, water the plants...",andy,42
52558,Clean the toilets.,andy,3
52560,Pull the poop out of the toilets.,andy,7
52562,"Just, please...",andy,2
52564,Please!,andy,1
52566,Give me something!,andy,3
52568,Thank you.,andy,2
52570,Thank you.,andy,2
52572,I have a delicious secret.,andy,5
52574,Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?,jim,12
52575,"Yeah, it is actually.",andy,4
52576,"Mmm, I can't hold it in any longer. Um, I am faking this, okay? Because I convinced David Wallace to buy Dunder Mifflin back from Sabre. And at three o'clock today he's gonna walk in here and reinstate me as manager.",andy,41
52577,[enters with the kids] Family picture!,pam,6
52578,Pam? No!,jim,2
52579,"What? Honey, we talked about this.",pam,6
52580,"No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap.",jim,14
52581,"Yes, and then we decided that was crazy.",pam,8
52582,"No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.",jim,11
52583,"No, we settled in a much more rational place, remember?",pam,10
52584,Nope.,jim,1
52585,We decided that there's no way Dwight would harm a child.,pam,11
52586,But are you a hundred percent sure? I don't think any of us are.,jim,14
52587,"No, no.",pam,2
52588,Nope.,jim,1
52589,But it's free. And we'll keep our eye on them.,pam,10
52590,That's-,jim,1
52591,Yes!,pam,1
52592,That's-,jim,1
52593,And we'll make sure Dwight doesn't do anything C-R-A-Z-Y.,pam,9
52594,Okay.,jim,1
52596,"Great, right up there.",dwight,4
52597,Yeah?,pam,1
52598,Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.,jim,9
52599,Okay.,pam,1
52600,Alright. Why don't you just-,jim,5
52601,"Oh, great. Thank you.",pam,4
52602,-give him to me and... perfect.,jim,6
52603,Okay.,pam,1
52604,This is great.,jim,3
52605,You ready?,pam,2
52606,Excuse me.,jim,2
52607,There we go.,pam,3
52608,Just do it.,jim,3
52609,I'll just stand here?,pam,4
52610,"Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.",jim,8
52612,"Let's do it, shoot it.",jim,5
52614,Great.,jim,1
52615,Up here. [whistles],dwight,3
52616,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.",jim,4
52617,"Jim, right here, right here. [snaps fingers] Okay, good.",dwight,9
52618,"Oh, so that's it?",jim,4
52619,That's it.,dwight,2
52620,See? That wasn't so hard.,pam,5
52621,"Cute kids, thanks for coming.",dwight,5
52629,"Well, well, well. Senator Lipton, welcome. Angela.",dwight,7
52631,Nice to see you. May I hold him?,dwight,8
52636,"Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place.",dwight,17
52639,Really?,dwight,1
52640,"This is getting more and more delicious by the minute. [gargles alcohol, chokes, coughs] It's go time.",andy,17
52641,"Hey Nellie, I made soup - I made you some soup.",andy,11
52643,But it's really good- [drops soup] Oh!,andy,7
52646,A delicious moment.,andy,3
52648,"Well, but it-",andy,3
52650,"Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me-",dwight,33
52653,"Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?",dwight,19
52658,"He defecated, aw.",dwight,3
52679,Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?,dwight,9
52682,I just want you guys not to worry. 'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine.,andy,15
52683,"No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk...",jim,28
52686,You hit her?,pam,3
52687,No. That is not the deal. Calibrate.,andy,7
52689,"That's not true either! That's also total- Everyone, please relax. I think you're gonna like this surprise guest.",andy,18
52693,[his phone rings] Huh? Hold on.,andy,6
52696,Oh boy.,jim,2
52697,"Oh, Andy.",pam,2
52699,I'm not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back.,andy,13
52701,"Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum 'Suck It' to the U.S. military.",andy,29
52702,"Andy, come on.",jim,3
52704,"I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy.",andy,9
52706,Stop saying my name.,andy,4
52708,"Thank you, Erin.",andy,3
52710,But have you ever actually seen him yourself?,pam,8
52712,"Erin, come- Come on. You know I've been talking to David Wallace.",andy,12
52714,[into phone] Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready.,dwight,12
52718,"Yeah, I know.",andy,3
52720,Hey.,jim,1
52723,"David, what are you doing here?",pam,6
52726,What? Thought I heard my name. What? I'm the new manager?,andy,11
52728,But it's- it is- it is me? Right?,andy,8
52730,What?,andy,1
52732,Oh my God!,andy,3
52734,Wow. From janitor to manager?,andy,5
52736,That's quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P.,andy,9
52738,"From total loss to total boss, I mean-",andy,8
52741,I was so looking forward to that and it did not... go as I thought it would.,andy,17
52753,Guess I'd better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place.,andy,18
52754,Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.,jim,12
52755,"Gosh, I hope so.",andy,4
52764,Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all.,andy,10
52766,It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever's on your mind.,andy,15
52768,No.,andy,1
52770,Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?,andy,13
52772,I just want one mother[bleep] delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?,andy,13
52773,If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?,andy,16
52775,"All right, you sly bastard. When can you start?",andy,9
52782,Gymnasts? You're going to seek out uneducated gymnasts?,andy,8
52784,"Mm. Mm-hmm. [they hug, Robert kisses him on the lips]",andy,10
52786,Hello.,dwight,1
52788,They're testing it now.,dwight,4
52790,Seventy-two hours.,dwight,2
52792,Yes. [Angela sits and holds his hand],dwight,7
52800,"How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. Mmm, mmm! So that's really good. But I got some disappointing medical news.",dwight,32
52806,"For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great.",pam,10
52807,You are really good at modesty. She's a genius.  She painted this incredible mural in the kids' room. There's a hippo leading a parade of 500 children',jim,28
52808,"Kay, well, you had that interesting thing.",pam,7
52809,"Oh, yeah",jim,2
52810,"Yes, Jim's friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college.",pam,19
52811,Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.,jim,9
52812,And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too.,pam,11
52813,"In Philly, so, that doesn't really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.",jim,20
52814,He said if it takes off he's gonna buy us a new car.,pam,13
52815,An Altima or better.,jim,4
52823,And that was our summer.,pam,5
52824,we good?,jim,2
52826,"Don't you guys have everything. I mean, its just a paper company.",pam,12
52828,"Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I don't think anything's gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids there's just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time.",pam,41
52840,"No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith's face.  And if that  makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim.",jim,45
52842,"Hey! Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, it'll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks, yeah right!",andy,31
52844,What're you still doing here?,andy,5
52846,You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died.,andy,14
52848,"See me in my office later. The new guys, alright. It's Clark and, um'",andy,14
52850,In Outward Bound it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called Plop.,andy,17
52852,Cause you're always taking dumps.,andy,5
52854,"Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time.",andy,18
52858,"No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane.",andy,19
52859,I don't see it.,dwight,4
52861,"Whoa! Mind blown. It's like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr?",andy,17
52862,"Yes, yes I am. [puts his arm around Clark]",dwight,9
52863,"Dwight, Jr! [Dwight gives Clark a noogie]",andy,7
52864,In a way it's like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they'll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I'll have a grandson.,dwight,31
52876,"David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slack lining, I ate a worm.",andy,16
52879,"Yeah, I gotta go David. [hangs up phone] Why is Nellie still here?",andy,13
52881,"Mm, then I will make up a cause.",andy,8
52883,Then forget I just told you that.,andy,7
52885,Now I know why Michael hated you so much.,andy,9
52886,"Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods!",dwight,8
52888,"Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested?",dwight,21
52890,"Well, we're both just kinda learning as we go, aren't we?",dwight,11
52892,"Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head.",dwight,14
52894,"So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man?",dwight,18
52896,Spoken like a true root man.,dwight,6
52898,My calls?,dwight,2
52900,You want a list of my clients? You want my leads?,dwight,11
52902,Ok,dwight,1
52904,With my leads and stuff like that?,dwight,7
52906,Cause you're interested in going into sales?,dwight,7
52908,"Wow, that's great. That's great. Ok, good, let's talk about that, ok?",dwight,12
52910,You're not getting my clients! Nice try.,dwight,7
52911,"Paranoid? I'm not familiar with the word. And I really don't have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.",dwight,29
52912,"Jim, get ready for the battle of your life.",dwight,9
52913,Done. Explain.,jim,2
52914,The new guys. Dwight Jr is after  my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub.,dwight,21
52915,"Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.",jim,14
52916,"Wait, sales'what sales meeting?",dwight,4
52917,The new guys called one.,jim,5
52918,The new guys called a sales meeting?,dwight,7
52919,Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?,jim,18
52920,There's no belt above black. Is there a belt above black?,dwight,11
52921,You should ask him. It's a color you would never expect. [Dwight storms off] Too easy.,jim,16
52925,I wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. It's going to be terrible.,andy,17
52927,"No I'm going to make sure that it is. And if it isn't, I'm going to take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I don't like to throw around the b-word, but I'm going to be a huge bitch to you.",andy,41
52928,Now this is called slack lining.,andy,6
52929,"I set up the old slack line to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb.",andy,32
52930,"If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But, if you Toby out, then you'll feel like a real Nellie. How about a hand, screw those guys. Now, these are my actual Outward Bound counselors, Rafe and Feather.",andy,42
52932,"That's me. The powder is for your protection, Feather has permanent athlete's foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack.",andy,24
52933,You a sports fan?,jim,4
52935,Oh. Any team sports?,jim,4
52937,"Phillies fan, though, right?",jim,4
52939,"No, like baseball. A baseball team.",jim,6
52941,Ok. Good talk.,jim,3
52942,I have nothing in common with Plop.,jim,7
52943,"All right, who's next? Nellie?",andy,5
52945,Nonsense. Get up here.,andy,4
52947,"Come on. Uh, are you gonna wear your heels?",andy,9
52949,"Ok, sure. There ya go. Atta girl. Hey, alright. Whoa! [pushes Nellie off slack line] You suck. Alright, who's next? Darryl?",andy,21
52951,Dwight Jr? This looks like your speed.,andy,7
52953,"Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up.",andy,10
52955,Focus on the horizon. [Clark successfully walks the slack line] Whoa! Look at this guy.,andy,15
52958,"Hey, yes.",andy,2
52959,"Boo, unimpressed. It's a tightrope for babies. Boo!",dwight,8
52961,Alright. Let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord.,andy,14
52962,Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail?,andy,7
52963,"Ok, I am just getting started, ok?",dwight,7
52965,Well it's official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool.,andy,12
52966,[bleeding heavily from the mouth] That's not true.  Just give me another chance.,dwight,14
52969,What?,dwight,1
52971,This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. [tries to go in locked door] Idiots.,dwight,21
52972,"Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn't seem so macho now, does it? It's a jump rope!",dwight,40
52973,Dwight!,pam,1
52974,"Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on.",dwight,10
52975,[sees trapeze contraption] What are you doing?,pam,7
52976,"Come here, I'll show you.",dwight,5
52983,"Oh, come on, Pete! God, that's just sad. If he doesn't watch himself, he's gonna be here for years, doing nothing. [sober realization] Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.",jim,30
52984,Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it's literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.,dwight,41
52985,I will?,pam,2
52986,"You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn't you say?",dwight,11
52987,"Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds.",pam,6
52988,So you'll do it?,dwight,4
52989,No.,pam,1
52990,"Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.",dwight,12
52991,"Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life.",pam,14
52992,Come on.,dwight,2
52993,Exactly the way it is.,pam,5
52994,"No, Pam.",dwight,2
52995,"Yes, and there's nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.",pam,19
52996,"Please? Please, Pam?",dwight,3
52997,"Find someone else, I don't know. Ask Phyllis.",pam,8
52998,"I can't use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I'll be launched into space. God, you're so insensitive.",dwight,24
53010,You ready?,pam,2
53011,Yeah. You know what? I'll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.,jim,15
53012,Kay.,pam,1
53013,"Ok. [prepares bike trapeze]Oh, god.",dwight,5
53014,"Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I'm about to prove it. Dwight Schrute!",dwight,44
53015,"Hey, man. It's halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don't. I'm in. Yeah, yep, I'm all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. [hangs up] Yeah!",jim,30
53016,"Woo! [starts pedaling out until trapeze bike flips over, he dangles from the handlebars] Ahh!!",dwight,15
53022,There are two things that I am passionate about. Recycling and revenge.,andy,12
53024,"[surveying an untidy office] The building's custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, we're living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel.",pam,39
53026,"Well, it doesn't spin. We'll just move the wheel one notch each morning and' you see what chore you get that day.",pam,22
53029,"No, I'm familiar with spinning. It's just that wouldn't work with a chore wheel because people might get the same chore-",pam,21
53030,"[interrupting] Bugh, boring. All she talks about is chores.",andy,9
53032,[reluctantly] Spinning would be more fun.,jim,6
53033,[frustrated] 'Kay.,pam,2
53035,"Yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink.",pam,9
53038,I don't think you guys understand why we're doing this. It's-,pam,11
53041,[everyone cheers as Meredith spins and lands on 'tiny wheel'] The tiny wheel actually does have chores. It's so cute no one seems to mind.,pam,25
53042,[referencing the 'tiny wheel'] Toilets! [everyone cheers as Meredith accepts her chore],pam,12
53044,"[exiting house] Thanks, mom!",pam,4
53045,[to Pam] A banana?,jim,4
53046,Yeah. I'm afraid he's only gonna have hot dogs.,pam,9
53047,"Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.",jim,13
53048,Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs.,pam,9
53049,[to camera] Just' so weird.,jim,5
53068,[Jim and Pam approaching the wedding venue] Is this his house?,jim,11
53069,Think so.,pam,2
53071,[taking glass] Thank you.,pam,4
53073,"[embarrassed] Yes, thank you. [finishes banana and hands server the peel]",pam,11
53074,OK.,jim,1
53075,[as Jim receives and declines a call] Who's that?,pam,9
53076,"Uh, my ex-fianc??.",jim,3
53077,[sarcastically] Ha-ha.,pam,2
53078,"I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn't know. Um' actually I did tell Pam and we decided 'no'. But, then I decided 'yes' anyway. So, I'm thinking there's another conversation coming. And, it's hard to know when that will be.",jim,45
53088,I will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works.,dwight,13
53089,"Uh, correction, I give to a foundation that teaches homeless children nautical flag signaling. Changes lives.",andy,16
53091,I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for the preservation of nautical flag signaling.,andy,16
53093,No thank you.,dwight,3
53095,"Fine, I chose the Global Relief Foundation.",dwight,7
53097,Which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban.,dwight,11
53099,Yeah. The Taliban in Afa-ghanistan.,dwight,5
53102,"Well, it looks like there won't be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome. [wads up Nellie's charity sheet and tosses it toward her]",dwight,33
53103,"[approaches Roy back at the wedding] There he is. Is it almost time to cut the pancake, or what?",jim,19
53105,"Thanks for inviting us, by the way-",jim,7
53107,"That was, that was a surprise.",jim,6
53109,You're welcome.,jim,2
53111,"By the way, man, this place is... beautiful.",jim,8
53113,Gravel company?,jim,2
53115,"Not gravel, obviously. [both chuckle] No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-",jim,19
53117,"Yeah, you never know.",jim,4
53119,"OK, Kenny.",jim,2
53134,He plays piano?,jim,3
53135,No. Roy? No.,pam,3
53138,[in the car] We still surprise each other.,pam,8
53139,Definitely.,jim,1
53140,"You know, I never did it, but for your 30th birthday I really wanted to surprise you with-",pam,18
53141,Courtside seats. Sixers.,jim,3
53142,"Yes. But, what I didn't tell you is that I actually bought the tickets. We only didn't go because it was-",pam,21
53143,It was an away game.,jim,5
53144,"In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams. [long pause] Do we know everything about each other?",pam,32
53145,No.,jim,1
53146,Tell me one thing about you I don't know.,pam,9
53147,"[laughs] Um, ok. [thinks but says nothing]",jim,7
53148,"[in the kitchen] Oh, here's one. Did I ever tell you about the time that my brothers videotaped the lottery announcement? And bought the winning numbers the next day? And then, played the tape for me the next week, and I-",jim,41
53149,And you thought you guys were millionaires.,pam,7
53150,You heard that one.,jim,4

53778,"Hey honey, I don't think we should push him.",pam,9
53779,"Oh no, I'm gonna push him. You know why? Because you're getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want?!",jim,48
53781,"Stop ordering me around, Jim!",dwight,5
53782,What do we want?!,jim,4

53804,"I'm barren, Jim.",dwight,3
53805,What?,jim,1
53806,My trouser hives are void of honey.  I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.,dwight,43
53807,"Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.",jim,16
53808,You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?,dwight,13

54222,"Yes the boat means everything to my family, but we need the money. Got the memories, don't need the boat. Can't cry about it.  What are you gonna do? Cry about it? [chokes up] Excuse me.",andy,37

54275,That's impossible.,dwight,2

54335,"My resignation? What are you talking about? No! I was just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the CEO and chairman, David Wallace!",dwight,27
54337,That's the family boat!,andy,4
54339,Right?,andy,1
54342,Sorry?,andy,1

54368,I've had a thousand picnics on this boat. The point was for me to sail it.,andy,16
54370,Fine. But I could have.,andy,5
54372,I am the captain.,andy,4
54374,Right?,andy,1
54376,"I'm the captain. [to boat guy] Hey, charm school.",andy,9

54397,"Same thing. [To Walt] Come on. I need a crew. You should be my crew. Three weeks, open ocean, no booze. You need this. I need it, we need this. Serious bro time, come on.",andy,35

54463,"What else can I show you? Oh, damn it!",andy,9
54465,"Yeah, it was. That's okay though. I got this cool desalinator device. It sucks up sea water through this hose and pumps out fresh water. See, check it out.  Ow!",andy,31
54467,"Ah! That's not good. I better sign off. I hate to get going. I mean these skype sessions are, like, the only thing that keep me sane out here, you know? [laughs crazily]",andy,33

54483,"The White Pages: Do you want it? No. Do you use it? No. Does it inexplicably show up on your doorstep three times a year? Yes, yes, and yes. There's a reason that we in the paper industry call this thing 'the White Whale'. Look at all that sweet blubber.",dwight,50
54485,I'm gonna need to put you on hold for a second. [presses hold button] Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... where's Stanley?,dwight,26

54543,You've got this Schrute.,pam,4
54545,Hello.,dwight,1
54547,May I please speak to your boss?,dwight,7
54550,"Okay, this isn't working for me, 'cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss.",dwight,18

54553,[sighing],dwight,1
54554,"Hello, Mr. Schrute, nice to see you. Please have a seat.",pam,11
54555,I never sit down during sales  meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve minutes,dwight,25
54557,"I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once I'm finished, it's over.",dwight,35
54558,"Okay, let's stop here. Anyone have any thoughts?",pam,8
54559,I thought it went great.,dwight,5

54570,"Oh, [clearing throat, deeper voice] Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh...",jim,15
54572,"[laughing]  Um, you know what?  I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell.",jim,23
54574,I'm gonna try a different spot. Okay?,jim,7
54576,"Okay, I'll call you right back.",jim,6
54578,"Okay, when you're selling to women, it is crucial that you listen, Dwight. Also you want to respect their... Are you listening now?",pam,23
54579,Yes.,dwight,1
54580,"Okay, well you have to show us.",pam,7
54581,"That's impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs don't vibrate at all.",dwight,33
54582,Huh. [nodding] Uh huh.,pam,4
54583,What are you doing?,dwight,4
54584,A little smile and a nod shows that I hear you. Got it?,pam,13
54585,Kind of.,dwight,2
54586,"Nellie, why don't you  tell Dwight what we were doing earlier today. And Dwight, you show us that you're listening.",pam,21
54589,I am a person.,dwight,4
54592,That's a bit extreme.,dwight,4

54598,Hello.,dwight,1
54600,Thank you. I'm so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina.,dwight,28
54604,"Ten years ago, I didn't care if Dwight  got married or died a beet-farming bachelor.  But having kids makes you so soft. I used to watch Pulp Fiction and laugh, and now I'm like, that poor gimp is somebody's child.",pam,42
54605,"You know, I think there could be a lot of benefits if you could learn to get along with women.",pam,20
54606,"Look, I have no problem with women. It's businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Don't lie about your shoulders!",dwight,23
54607,"Dwight, listen to me. Businesswomen are just normal, nice, reasonable people. Who is a nice, reasonable person in your experience?",pam,20
54608,I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.,dwight,12
54609,"Okay, so, when you're selling to this woman, just imagine that she's that nice, reasonable barber.",pam,16
54610,"Okay, I can do that.",dwight,5
54611,Mm-hmm. Good. Baby steps.,pam,4
54612,He used to fight dogs.,dwight,5

54635,Nobody!,jim,1

54642,"Okay, great.",pam,2
54643,"[to himself] Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it.",dwight,17
54644,Oh my God. It's Jan.,pam,5
54645,"Oh, dear God in heaven.",dwight,5
54646,"Jan used to be one of my superiors, and she is one of the most erratic and terrifying people I have ever met.",pam,23
54648,"Jim and I are pretty sure she had an affair with her ex-assistant Hunter. He was 17. But she looks great. If she asks, will you tell her I said that?",pam,31
54649,"Forget everything we taught you.  Hey, Jan! It's so great to see you.",pam,14
54651,What?,pam,1
54653,Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off. [laughs],dwight,17
54654,"Sorry. Um, David is in Vermont. Did you speak with him? He sent Dwight instead.",pam,15
54660,Listening.,dwight,1
54662,Sorry.,dwight,1
54664,Okay.,dwight,1
54665,So this was all just a trick. You don't really have any business to give?,pam,15
54667,But not to us.,pam,4
54669,"You did good, Dwight. It's okay. I mean, seriously, Jan's not normal. Let's just go. She's not going to sell to us.",pam,22
54670,"Yes, she is. Now,  I may not have any instincts with women, but I have  an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. I'll be right back.",dwight,29
54671,What?,pam,1
54673,Yeah.,pam,1
54675,"Yeah. Um, do you have any other pictures of Astrid?",pam,10
54690,Wow. Your voice is as lovely as ever.,pam,8
54692,And it is so cute how she signs her name.,pam,10
54694,"Oh, okay. It's just that's how Cece does it with the backwards 'E's.",pam,13
54696,"Oh, actually she can.",pam,4
54698,Of course.,pam,2
54700,Um... 'A'... 'X'? I don't -- you got me.,pam,9
54702,[whispering] I'm so sorry. I hate this. You're better.,pam,9
54709,Mm. Excuse me. Could I get some more water?,pam,9
54711,Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well I've got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.,dwight,20
54712,"Oh, my God.",pam,3
54714,"You're the Quizno's. [chuckles] Jan, may I introduce to you your own personal Dunder Mifflin liaison, devoted to servicing this account with total client satisfaction. I sensed that Molly wasn't quite meeting your needs -- nothing like, uh, your old assistant... Hunter. Was that his name?",dwight,46
54716,Hmm?,dwight,1
54718,"Okay, you do not have to do this.",pam,8
54720,He's been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young.,dwight,13
54722,Very good.,dwight,2
54724,Jim Halpert.,jim,2
54726,Hey man. I am so sorry about that.,jim,8
54728,[laughs],jim,1
54730,"Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But don't worry. I'll figure it out.",jim,18
54732,"Uh, what does -- what does that mean?",jim,8
54739,"Oh, hey, Molly. You should just quit.",pam,7
54741,"Oh and uh, Molly... I know it can't be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings.",dwight,18
54742,"Dwight, that was really nice. You should ask for her number.",pam,11
54743,"Oh, I got her number. 415-YCL.",dwight,6
54744,That's a license number?,pam,4
54745,"That's all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know.",dwight,17

54763,Are you avoiding your phone call?,pam,6
54764,"What? Yeah, right. As if.",jim,5
54765,"Today I will be asking David Wallace if I can start working part-time, because the sports marketing company that I started really needs me to be there.",jim,27
54766,"Last week Jim wasn't there, and they named the company Athlead.",pam,11
54767,I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace.,jim,12
54768,Tell them your opening line.,pam,5
54769,"[sighs] Hey David, how would you like a guy who's not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?",jim,29
54770,I think it's good. He likes fishing.,pam,7
54771,This is gonna be awful.,jim,5
54775,"Come on in, the water's fine.",dwight,6
54777,I know. That's not why I'm naked. I always work out without my clothes. [does jumping jacks],dwight,17
54779,"Oh, I'm sorry, your vigilante privileges ended when you broke up with me. If I'm not in your panties, I don't go vigilantes. Why don't you ask your husband?",dwight,29
54781,"[sighs] All right, what are we talking? Surveillance, wire-tapping?",dwight,9
54783,"Yeah, the less I know, the better. I know just the guy. He was a volunteer sheriff too. Kicked off the force.",dwight,22
54785,I can try. I'm gonna use SMS text.,dwight,8

54792,"I mean, I can handle any client issues from Philly.",jim,10
54794,"Oh, you mean handle it in person. Oh, well, Phyllis and Stanley have agree to cover for me while I'm gone.",jim,21
54796,Yep.,jim,1
54798,"Oh, great.",jim,2
54800,Because we're friends.,jim,3
54802,Unfair. When's my birthday?,jim,4
54804,"How about this-- You let me take you to lunch, and I make my case?",jim,15
54806,All right.,jim,2
54821,Get in the van.,dwight,4

54838,Wow!,dwight,1
54839,"[studying mural wall] I guess if I make a mistake, I can just paint over it with a shrub or something. It's just, I think less of paintings with a lot of shrubs. So, I'm gonna limit myself to one shrub.",pam,41

54871,Yes. Crazy. Thank you.,dwight,4
54873,No! No!,dwight,2

54881,No. Angela! What are you saying?,dwight,6
54883,"I'm trying, but what you're asking is--",dwight,7
54885,"Okay. But it's cruel, because a woman with damaged knees can't scrub worth a damn.",dwight,15

55562,"Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don't think it's kicked in yet. I'm gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple. [Dwight collapses]",dwight,28
55583,"I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere. [Dwight gets into his car and another insecticidal grenade goes off]",dwight,38
55588,"Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.",jim,19
55590,And that's all?,jim,3
55592,"No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done.",jim,17
55594,"[Jim's phone goes to voicemail] This is Jim Halpert, leave a message.",jim,12

55614,"Oh, god, this again? You're Stinky.",dwight,6
55615,"Okay. There's no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.",jim,21
55616,"Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity.",dwight,14
55618,"Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. [back to Jim] See what you leave me with here, Jim?",dwight,26
55619,"Hey, I'm in Philadelphia right now.",jim,6
55620,How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.,dwight,27
55621,Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?,jim,14
55622,"Mmm. That's a good' question. 300 times' [Jim hangs up] 180' Um that comes to 25 minutes. [realizes Jim hung up] Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you.",dwight,42
55625,"Hey, good luck. When you get to Philly, will you tell Jim I miss him?",pam,15
55627,"Ha ha. That'd be great. Kind of like ditching school, except instead of getting suspended, you get' What do you get? Oh my god! Why didn't I think of this? Andy's not here. Oh, hey, Erin, um, I'm expecting a shipment of pens. Can you cover that?",pam,47

55660,You ready for your interview?,pam,5

55664,"Really, you can't be scared of a room full of Jims. I love the guy, but he's basically Gumby with hair. [Darryl laughs]",pam,23
55666,"You know, you're right! We hadn't even thought of that, had we boy? [to Clark]",dwight,15
55668,"[Takes picture from desk] Oh! You're a hunter I see. Spend your early mornings out in the blinds, like Clarky and me. Huh? [grabs Clark's shoulder]",dwight,26

55714,Oh' really.,dwight,2

55718,"What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?",dwight,16

55732,Yeah? [to Darryl] You ready?,jim,5
55734,Let's do it!,jim,3
55752,"I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.",dwight,15
55755,"Maybe if you listened a little bit, you'd improve. No wonder women despise you.",dwight,14

55761,That never happened. He's always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught 'saving treats' from the kitty litter box.,dwight,25

55820,Not us.,pam,2

55823,Congratulations.,pam,1
55825,I guess you gotta move to Philly after all.,pam,9
55827,"No, I'm not upset. I'm really excited for Darryl' Maybe I'm a little disappointed that we'll be losing him.",pam,19
55836,"Yeah, you don't want Italian. You'll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, you'll be doing life in Rikers Island.",dwight,22

56091,"Well, it was an important phone call.",pam,7
56092,"I haven't told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he's always like, 'Beesly!' I love that. Only thing better than getting the job-- 'Beesly!' [chuckles]",pam,40

56123,Can you figure out how to upload Cece's dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.,jim,16

56125,"You're not serious, are you? You didn't get any of the recital?",jim,12
56126,"No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part.",pam,20

56207,"Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we're scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix ' me asking the boss of the company I'm abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash.  So' problem solved. Thanks, guys.",jim,47
56208,And this chair's gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!,dwight,10
56209,I'm on the phone. I'm on the phone.,jim,8
56210,No doy!,dwight,2
56211,I'm just gonna call you back. Thanks.,jim,7
56213,[laughs] No earbuds! [both laugh],dwight,5
56214,I'm sure he's just nervous.,jim,5
56215,[sighs] It's fine. It's just a seating arrangement. Doesn't matter.,pam,10
56216,"So I've got your resume here, but it's not telling me everything.",dwight,12
56218,"Well, I'm the one offering the job.",dwight,7
56220,I've worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I'm an Assistant to the Regional Manager.,dwight,19
56222,"Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I'm sure he'd give a reference.",dwight,23
56224,"Well, they can't all be winners. But Trevor's next and he's a real professional. You say, 'Jump,' and he says, 'Oh who?' He loves to jump on people, that Trevor.",dwight,30
56225,What makes you think you'd be an effective paper salesman?,dwight,10
56227,"Well, it's a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.",dwight,11
56229,All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?,dwight,15
56231,There were only two options.,dwight,5
56233,This is a bus transfer.,dwight,5
56236,"Sure, yeah, go ahead.",jim,4
56238,"Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? You're clean, right?",jim,13
56240,"Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don't listen to it at all because we're at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so'",jim,28
56242,"Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.",jim,8
56244,Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.,jim,16
56246,I need you to breathe in my face right now.,jim,10
56248,"What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?",jim,8
56250,"I knew it, I knew it.",jim,6
56252,"I looked at you coming around, and I said, 'Wintergreen.'",jim,10
56253,"I can't hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.",dwight,22
56254,"Okay, here's one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock.  You can't rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.",dwight,43
56256,Thank you.,dwight,2
56258,"Damn it! Perfect answer, again.",dwight,5
56260,"Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond '",dwight,10
56262,And anoth',dwight,2
56264,No.,dwight,1
56266,"It does, but still no.",dwight,5
56268,"Oh, you think they're my only friends? I've got way more friends than that, and they're all better than the losers who work here.",dwight,24
56271,"Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?",pam,10
56276,"Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He's got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I've got big expectations, Mose-wise.",dwight,40
56277,What quality would make you a good sales associate?,dwight,9
56279,It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical.,dwight,20
56281,"You know we live together, right?",dwight,6
56283,"And I've never seen you go to work, ever.",dwight,9
56285,So why is this on your resume? [door slams],dwight,9
56302,How is it my fault?,jim,5
56304,But it's Dwight who's bring in all the weirdos.,jim,9
56306,"Hey, I'm the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim's away. I'm in a position where I'm rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong. [sighs] Forget it.  I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off.",pam,51
56308,"Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input'",jim,29
56309,[presses speaker button] This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don't lie. I can tell if you're lying.,dwight,21
56311,David.,dwight,1
56313,"Really? That's interesting. 'Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who's here every day. And frankly, killing it lately.",dwight,38
56314,"I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife'",jim,18
56316,Oh. Um',jim,2
56318,Okay. I can't say that that's not fair.,jim,8
56319,"Sounds fair to me, David.",dwight,5
56321,"Oh, yeah, so we'll just do that later.",jim,8
56322,No. Why not do it now?,dwight,6
56324,"Uh' [clears throat] Well, it's about Athlead. I'm sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?",jim,21
56325,"I'd love to be in the loop, David.",dwight,8
56327,There's a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor ',jim,11
56329,"Yes, okay. Bye.",jim,3
56330,[whispers] I'd love to invest.,dwight,5
56331,"No, thanks.",jim,2
56332,I'd like to give you $100 million. [snickers] [phone ringing],dwight,10
56334,"Hide, they're giving out jobs upstairs. Why don't you go up and get one?",pam,14
56336,Yeah.,pam,1
56339,"Dwight, you can't just hire someone 'cause they're your friend.",jim,10
56340,I'm not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.,dwight,19
56342,You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero.,dwight,14
56345,"Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch.",dwight,15
56346,"Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of 'em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof.",dwight,31
56347,Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this.,dwight,8
56349,I sure do.,dwight,3
56351,I will pay you whatever it takes.,dwight,7
56353,"No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money.",dwight,20
56355,Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You're still at the 570 number?,dwight,13
56357,"Okay. Good, good, good. [sighs]",dwight,5
56359,This isn't gonna work out.,dwight,5
56362,"[groaning] No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them. [knock at door]",dwight,19
56364,I do that myself now.,dwight,5
56366,"No, you've been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes.",dwight,12
56370,Or none of you [chuckles],dwight,5
56373,I wish I could hire all of you.,dwight,8
56375,"Psst. Jim Jim? [whispering] Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around.",dwight,13
56376,"Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I'm not looking south, I'm not livin'.  That's what I always say.",jim,22
56377,Just act natural. [grunts],dwight,4
56378,And I was thinking it's only fair that you help make this decision since they'll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.,dwight,24
56379,But you know I wouldn't hire any of these all-stars.,jim,10
56380,"Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it's your call.",dwight,15
56381,Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?,jim,16
56382,I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn't picture any of them in the old gold and gray.,dwight,28
56383,I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.,jim,10
56384,Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal.,dwight,4
56385,"Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?",jim,12
56386,Yes. Thank you. Amazed.,dwight,4
56387,"And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.",jim,18
56389,What? This is such bullcrap!,dwight,5
56390,"Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.",jim,13
56391,Wow. So much crap. It's just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?,dwight,17
56392,Too much now.,jim,3
56393,Okay.,dwight,1
56395,"Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert's home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.",dwight,26
56396,That seems inconsiderate.,jim,3
56398,"Guys, it wasn't up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn't my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor.",dwight,23
56402,"Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?",dwight,12
56404,Okay.,dwight,1
56407,All right. I think that went well.,jim,7
56408,"So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that'll print out'Hey. Meet your new desk mate.",jim,20
56410,"Oh, cool. Hey Clark.",pam,4
56411,"Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.",jim,24
56412,"Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate.",pam,12
56413,Okay. I'm really sorry I told the guys I'd be there for the board meeting.,jim,15
56414,Of course.,pam,2
56415,I'll call you when I get there.,jim,7
56416,Okay.,pam,1
56417,All right.,jim,2
56418,Bye.,pam,1
56419,Take care of my wife. I will be back.,jim,9
56420,They say that everyone outgrows their friends at some point in their lives. Well I just outgrew them all in the span of three hours.,dwight,25
56422,I'm good.,pam,2
56423,"Oh, hey, I'll take a coffee.",dwight,6
56425,[scoffs],dwight,1
56426,"Hey, Dwight. Wanna haze the new guy?",pam,7
56427,"Who, me?",dwight,2
56428,Us.,pam,1
56429,"Absolutely, I do. [giggles]",dwight,4
56430,"Okay. Okay, here. Okay, so the next time he goes to the bathroom, I'll distract him, you take that.",pam,19
56431,"Okay, yeah, I know what to do. Okay. Oh, that's great.",dwight,11
56432,[shushes],pam,1
56434,Aah!,dwight,1
56436,"Welcome to the club, pig! [laughs]",dwight,6
56437,"No, Dwight!",pam,2
56438,Aah!,dwight,1
56439,"No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I'm gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.",jim,55
56462,[in Darryl and Jim's Philly apartment] Hey.,jim,7
56464,We are splitting a sublet on a place near Philly.,jim,10
56466,"And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.",jim,26
56468,I'm couching it!,jim,3
56470,"And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this?",jim,20
56474,"Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.",jim,20
56476,[to camera] Who is this guy? We are killing it.,jim,10
56478,Yeah!,jim,1
56479,[entering office] Conference room. Everybody. Now!,pam,6
56480,You don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.,dwight,11
56481,"Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... That's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting.",pam,29
56482,"You're telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?",dwight,16
56483,Yeah.,pam,1
56484,"Let's go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!",dwight,10
56485,[to everyone in conference room] I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it.,pam,18
56487,"Yeah, but this is different.",pam,5
56489,"I don't think so, but they put paint where I didn't want paint. So...",pam,14
56491,"Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is... OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped.",pam,35
56495,Yes. Thank you. Let's answer that question.,pam,7
56497,What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn't just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don't you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.,pam,53
56499,"Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art.",pam,17
56500,"[as everyone begin to leave] No, no. Come on, guys. Don't go.",pam,12
56501,"Pam, I'll help you.",dwight,4
56502,You will?,pam,2
56503,"If there's anything I hate worse than art, it's crime.",dwight,10
56504,Thank you.,pam,2
56506,Yeah?,pam,1
56508,Great.,pam,1
56509,"I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I'm pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car.",pam,33
56510,[enters quickly] You need my pitchfork?,dwight,6
56512,What is it? I have vengeance to exact.,dwight,8
56514,"Ah, I'm not interested.",dwight,4
56516,"If I get the deicing gig, it's not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics. [exits]",dwight,18
56521,"[in warehouse] I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no one's business but my own.",dwight,30
56523,"Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts.",dwight,16
56526,Yes. Or nipplous breasts. Perhaps.,dwight,5
56528,"Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts...",dwight,16
56530,"We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group. [they notice Nate struggling with a box] Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him.",pam,38
56531,We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him. [holds up phone] Nate. Your mother is dying. [Nate reacts with grief],dwight,35
56532,"See, I feel bad about that.",pam,6
56533,It's all right. It's all right.,dwight,6
56535,No. She needs her rest again.,dwight,6
56537,"You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum.",dwight,23
56539,[interrupting] Tell us who defaced the mural!,pam,7
56541,All right. You can go. Give him his gum.,pam,9
56542,There's no gum. There never was any gum.,dwight,8
56550,"Nice job, man.",jim,3
56552,"[confused] What? [Darryl points at his thermos Jim has been using] Oh, man! I'm sorry about that.",jim,17
56554,"Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?",jim,8
56556,"Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that.",jim,14
56558,"No, no. If it's a big deal, it's a big deal.",jim,11
56560,No big deal.,jim,3
56562,"Honestly, I don't mind. [long, awkward pause until thermos is empty] Did you want me to wash it for you or...",jim,21
56564,[after tense pause] OK. Here ya go. [roughly hands Darryl his thermos],jim,12
56567,"[to Nellie] Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling. [Nellie nods] Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I've done anything to offend you. I'm sure it isn't easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn.",pam,59
56570,"Well, I didn't think that butt was funny.",pam,8
56572,What was that?,pam,3
56574,Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?,pam,13
56578,That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy.,pam,11
56579,"Oh, your little feelings party didn't work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first.",dwight,22
56580,We should just take him down.,pam,6
56581,Wait. Are you saying...,dwight,4
56582,I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face.,pam,11
56583,"Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt.",dwight,39
56584,He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that's important to him.,dwight,19
56585,Yes!,pam,1
56586,A little eye for an eye action.,dwight,7
56587,Yes!,pam,1
56588,Go all Hammurabi on this clown.,dwight,6
56589,We need an infiltrator.,pam,4
56590,I know just the man for the job. [looks at Clark],dwight,11
56591,Clark?,pam,1
56592,He even looks like a mole.,dwight,6
56600,Hey.,jim,1
56602,Yeah. Totally.,jim,2
56604,[after Darryl eyes him drinking from a thermos] It's mine. Don't worry.,jim,12
56606,I don't think you had to.,jim,6
56608,"I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?",jim,40
56610,That's not the point.,jim,4
56612,"No, I'm not making bread.",jim,5
56614,"Darryl, it doesn't matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make.",jim,14
56616,It's all good. Are we all good?,jim,7
56618,What's that cooler?,jim,3
56620,"Oh, crap. Were those yours?",jim,5
56621,[pulling Clark across the parking lot] I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?,dwight,22
56623,"Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.",dwight,19
56625,"Shh, shh.",pam,2
56627,Shh. Remember your lines.,pam,4
56629,Go move some paper!,dwight,4
56630,"[to Darryl on phone] Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse?",pam,15
56632,OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or...,pam,23
56634,"Yeah, something like that.",pam,4
56636,"Oh, great! [to Dwight] His truck!",pam,6
56637,Great. Get the plate number.,dwight,5
56638,OK. [to Darryl] Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?,pam,22
56639,So we know which truck to van...,dwight,7
56641,Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye. [to Dwight] Come on. [camera pans to Clark duct taped to a chair],pam,24
56654,I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural?,pam,12
56655,"Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I'm drawing your mural on Frank's truck's butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita.",dwight,21
56656,"Aw, Dwight. That's really sweet.",pam,5
56657,Let's see yours.,dwight,3
56658,"Oh, no. Um, I, I'm embarrassed. It's stupid.",pam,8
56659,This is amazing! Frank! And he's leaving a trail of poops?,dwight,11
56660,Yeah. And he has saggy boobs.,pam,6
56661,I saw that. That's great!,dwight,5
56662,Yeah. I feel better.,pam,4
56663,"Good. I'm glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.",dwight,24
56664,"I know. You miss Angela, don't you?",pam,7
56665,Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis.,dwight,13
56666,"I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. It's gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very...",pam,34
56668,"No, you had no right!",pam,5
56670,So? You started it!,pam,4
56673,Whoa.,pam,1
56684,"Well, I'm gonna say something to the producers.",pam,8
56686,"You shouldn't be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me.",pam,11
56688,Forget about my mural. It's stupid.,pam,6
56690,"It's crazy. Brian, I'm so sorry.",pam,6
56692,"Thanks, Brian.",pam,2
56694,"Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'.",jim,46
56696,Oh. Oh!,jim,2
56698,[imitating game announcer] You win. [Darryl throws empty can on floor] How good did that feel?,jim,16
56700,[to Jim] Hey. I feel so lucky we're in the same city for Valentine's Day.,pam,15
56701,"It's like magic. Or, it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.",jim,24
56702,[makes magic trick hand gesture] Alakazam!,pam,6
56703,"By the way, they do need an extra day next week.",jim,11
56704,"And, poof! He disappears. [Jim snaps, playing along]",pam,8
56715,"[knocks on Andy's door, then pretends to answer as Andy] Come in.",dwight,12
56716,"[talking to Andy's empty chair] Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract.",dwight,33
56717,"[pretending to be Andy] I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo.",dwight,19
56718,"I really like Andy these days. He's pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow. [thinks for a moment] Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we're in for an epic, confusing showdown.",dwight,48
56734,[eating] These are gross.,pam,4
56735,They are terrible.,jim,3
56736,"Oh, hey, don't fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill.",pam,17
56737,Oh my god. That's so romantic.,jim,6
56738,It's with Brian and Alyssa.,pam,5
56739,Oh my god. That's less romantic.,jim,6
56740,"I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life.",pam,17
56741,"Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That's good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?",jim,18
56742,That sounds nice.,pam,3
56743,"I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy.",jim,51
56759,"[enters restaurant with Pam] Hey, Brian.",jim,6
56761,Sorry we're late.,pam,3
56763,"Ha,ha,ha, yeah OK.",pam,3
56764,What?,jim,1
56765,He's on a no carb thing. Supposedly.,pam,7
56766,Oh.,jim,1
56768,Yeah.,pam,1
56769,"Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.",jim,28
56771,"Well, my dad can't hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him.",pam,15
56773,Where's Alyssa?,pam,2
56775,Oh.,pam,1
56777,[to Andy's empty chair] I have yet another sales order for you to sign.,dwight,14
56778,[acting as Andy] Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I don't know how you do it. You're a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo.,dwight,19
56779,"[in his office doorway, bearded and unkept] Hi Dwight.",andy,9
56780,You're back. [surveys Andy] And you're disgusting.,dwight,7
56782,"Well, well, well, look who it is.",andy,7
56784,"I guess I can cancel my order from Zappos.com because, oh, the loafers have arrived.",andy,15
56786,Hey! Sweetheart! [approaches Erin] I have missed you so much.,andy,10
56788,[attempting to hug Erin as she resists] I have been dreaming of this moment.,andy,14
56793,"Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour.",dwight,27
56794,"Obviously, that's why I'm here. I mean, I came back early to surprise Erin. Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart. [tries to embrace Erin but she begins playing cloppers] But, I'm just saying, I'm also excited about the Wallace meeting.",andy,38
56796,"No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months. [Andy stalls] Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months?",dwight,31
56797,"I have no idea. I don't know what he knows or doesn't know. But we've been in touch the whole time. I mean, it's not hard to get high-speed internet in Turks de Caicos, people. It's in every Bembe cafe.",andy,40
56799,Question. Where's Jim?,andy,3
56801,For two hours? Really?,andy,4
56803,"If the shoe fits. [plays g??iro and sings, Kevin echoes]",andy,10
56805,"Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight.",jim,16
56807,[obviously flustered] Yeah.,pam,3
56808,What?,jim,1
56810,Crying?,jim,1
56811,I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous.,andy,13
56812,Thank you.,dwight,2
56813,And you sold it to Jan too.,andy,7
56814,Yes!,dwight,1
56815,I mean... I'm impressed.,andy,4
56816,[laughing together] Yeah!,dwight,3
56817,"Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight.",andy,30
56818,You were on a boat.,dwight,5
56819,I was...,andy,2
56820,On a boat.,dwight,3
56821,That...,andy,1
56822,In the ocean.,dwight,3
56823,OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio? [Dwight resists] Just say the word 'coolio'.,andy,24
56824,I'm not gonna say it.,dwight,5
56825,Say it.,andy,2
56826,Not a word.,dwight,3
56827,Coolio.,andy,1
56828,No! [Andy makes a call] What do you think you're doing?,dwight,11
56829,Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up.,andy,12
56830,Don't you dare! Andy!,dwight,4
56832,"Hey, Jan. Nard dog here.",andy,5
56834,I was just looking over the paperwork. I found a little hiccup.,andy,12
56836,Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to.,andy,15
56838,[whispers] Coolio.,dwight,2
56840,Coolio. Coolio.,dwight,2
56841,"No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood.",andy,9
56843,Coolio.,dwight,1
56844,"It, it's, it's actually just an issue...",andy,7
56846,"No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything.",dwight,16
56847,"Jan, I don't know what he's talking about but...",andy,9
56849,"Well, ah, ah...",andy,3
56850,"Please Ja, Ja... [Jan hangs up]",dwight,6
56851,Aw! That was not how I had hoped that would go.,andy,11
56852,"[approaching Accounting] Hey, everybody, great job. [to Angela] Listen, we're a smidge behind on my paychecks.",andy,16
56854,All right. Thank you very much. [examines checks] Looking good. [after noticing something on Angela's desk] Who's that little fella?,andy,20
56856,"Wow, that's wonderful!",andy,3
56858,Uh-huh.,andy,1
56860,"Uh-huh... [after awkward pause] Uh-huh. [Angela hands him the bonus check] Thank you. Great. Well, we're all up to speed.",andy,20
56861,Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.,dwight,17
56864,"God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.",dwight,22
56865,"I'd like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I'm a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf.",dwight,36
56871,"Fine! The state he's in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway.",dwight,17
56872,"[appears approaching group, shaved and in a suit] What's going on in here, dirty players? Let's get back to busting some paper rhymes. Come on. [singing] Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Andy! [resumes talking] All right. Back to work.",andy,41
56873,"OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why?",pam,19
56874,"I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.",jim,54
56875,I didn't tell you about the crying because I didn't want you to know how upset I was. Because it would've stressed you out and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress.,pam,35
56876,"Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.",jim,13
56877,It's not Brian's fault.,pam,4
56878,"No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it.",jim,35
56879,OK.,pam,1
56880,I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip.,andy,34
56881,"Well, we had the Scranton White Pages.",dwight,7
56882,"Not helpful. Let's stay positive, people. OK?",andy,7
56884,"Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do.",andy,32
56886,Thank you.,andy,2
56888,Great!,andy,1
56890,[whispering] We had to let a warehouse guy go?!,andy,9
56892,[interrupting] ' lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.,dwight,11
56893,What?!,andy,1
56894,Yeah.,dwight,1
56895,There was a fire in the warehouse?,andy,7
56896,The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.,dwight,16
56898,"This is what I'm talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else?",andy,16
56900,What?!,andy,1
56902,No kidding?,andy,2
56904,Wow. Go Kathy. She's like 50.,andy,6
56906,"Good, good. What else?",andy,4
56907,"Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire.",andy,20
56909,The warehouse fire. Weren't you just down there? It's like burnt to ashes.,andy,13
56911,"[catches on to the ruse] I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, that's one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire.",andy,39
56913,I think you'll agree I explained that pretty well.,andy,9
56915,Thank you.,andy,2
56918,"Yeah, I guess.",andy,3
56920,"Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish?",andy,18
56922,What?,andy,1
56924,"OK, I get it. You're unhappy. I've been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here.",andy,35
56926,"On your side. But there's tons on my side. It's gushing. We're just out of sync right now. But that's just timing, it's timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time.",andy,40
56928,"I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If we're lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun.",andy,26
56930,"I'm gonna be a prune in like, 3 years.",andy,9
56932,"I know you may not be feeling love for me right now but, if you fake it, I won't be able to tell the difference. So, I'll feel good. And then, eventually, maybe, you'll actually start to love me again.",andy,40
56934,Yes. [hugs Erin] Come on. Totally.,andy,6
56935,You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.,jim,12
56936,Oh?,pam,1
56937,"Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?",jim,36
56938,Are you sure?,pam,3
56939,I just feel like we're gonna fight.,jim,7
56940,[obviously hurt] Yeah.,pam,3
56941,So... how 'bout let's not?,jim,5
56942,OK. [they begin to leave],pam,5
56943,"Oh, um. [pulls item from bag and hands to Pam] Happy Valentine's Day. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it.",jim,21
56944,"[sees it's a drawing of hers, framed] Wow. I didn't know you kept this.",pam,14
56945,"Yeah, yeah.",jim,2
56946,Thank you.,pam,2
56947,No problem.,jim,2
56948,I don't think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.,pam,21
56949,You really wanna fight on Valentine's Day?,jim,7
56950,"Yeah, I do.",pam,3
56951,"OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.",jim,8
56961,"I resent that. I, I never lied to you.",andy,9
56963,And all was good in Scranton PA that day.,andy,9
56965,Oscar says 'hi' all the time. He says all kinds of greetings. 'Hi' 'Hello' 'Hola' You're telling me you've never heard Oscar say 'hi'?,andy,24
56967,But you're calling me a liar.,andy,6
56969,"By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies you've been telling lately.",andy,20
56971,"Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013. [Reading from phone] 'Hey Andy, all's well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife's sick.' Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED!",andy,38
56973,This has been a really tough time.,andy,7
56975,Yeah.,andy,1
56977,"Erin just dumped me and I can't remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard.",andy,32
56979,It was like a security blan-,andy,6
56981,-ket,andy,1
56983,You're not?,andy,2
56985,That's awesome.,andy,2
56987,"David, I'll be there for you. These five words I swear to you. When you breathe, I want to be here for you. I'll be there for you. That's a poem by J.B. Jovi. I want you to have it.",andy,40
56989,Crystal.,andy,1
56991,Vanilla. [David looks confused] Vanilla Ice. It was a band.,andy,10
56992,Good morning.,andy,2
56994,"And how are you on this fine- [chokes up, runs into office and slams door pulling the blinds closed]",andy,19
56995,"[Crying] Ok, we ready? [cut] Don't use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is...brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up.",andy,53
56996,[Moaning from office] Ahhh! Oooooh! ahh,andy,6
56997,He sounds like a wounded animal.,pam,6
57001,Ok. [Andy continues moaning],pam,4
57003,"[taking paper from Kevin] Oh that's mine! Um, I'll just, I'll get it out of the way for you.",pam,19
57005,"[on phone] No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do.",dwight,52
57006,[Jumps out from behind vending machine] I need you.,dwight,9
57008,"And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes.",dwight,14
57010,"It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs.",dwight,9
57012,"You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was 'poisoned' by Aunt Shirley.",dwight,43
57014,"Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.",dwight,14
57016,Thank you.,dwight,2
57018,"Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out-",dwight,22
57020,And there's parts of her I don't even recognize.,dwight,9
57022,"There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap.",dwight,12
57024,"It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know?",dwight,9
57026,It's a divet...,dwight,3
57028,"..where it was and it needs, it needs a...",dwight,9
57030,Where are you going?,andy,4
57031,"Uh, not on a three month boat trip.",pam,8
57032,"Wha? Oh, burn. [laughs, Angela and Dwight move to leave.] Uh, excuse me. What, everyone can just leave whenever they want now?",andy,22
57033,How dare you?,dwight,3
57034,I'm still the boss!,andy,4
57036,The answer is yes.,andy,4
57038,Are they from you?,andy,4
57040,"Well then, I don't want them. You can keep 'em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it.",andy,27
57042,"Nope, I insist upon it. It's an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing.",andy,17
57044,I don't want to talk about work right now.,andy,9
57046,Then I want my big blue sweater back.,andy,8
57050,She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about?,andy,12
57052,"Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Here's the sitch: Erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first.",andy,54
57054,"Survey says: ENH! Doesn't make me feel better at all. Zero Clark Thirty, what do you got?",andy,17
57056,Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat.,andy,18
57058,No.,andy,1
57060,"May not seem like it, but this really helped. So, thank you. [Andy leaves]",andy,14
57062,"Aunt Shirley, Hello! It's me Dwight.",dwight,6
57066,"This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!",dwight,10
57068,OK,dwight,1
57070,"You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.",dwight,19
57074,"Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?",dwight,15
57076,Ok.,dwight,1
57078,"Yeah, trust me.",dwight,3
57080,"It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.",dwight,15
57082,"Why doesn't Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasn't she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places.",andy,37
57084,"I'm not snooping, there's just some crud on her screen.",andy,10
57091,"Uh, hello! Who's snooping on who now?",andy,7
57095,"Everyone please, just-",andy,3
57100,Oh my god.,andy,3
57105,"Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I'm psycho again. Uh, couldn't shake this feeling that Erin's dating someone so I looked at her phone.",andy,32
57107,Too late. I found out she's been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?,andy,17
57112,[whispers] hello!,pam,2
57113,Hey! There she is. [Pam laughs] How you doin?,jim,9
57114,"Hi! Hey, do I look ok?",pam,6
57115,You look great.,jim,3
57116,Ok,pam,1
57117,Yeah.,jim,1
57118,[pointing to Jim's bluetooth headset] What's that? Is that a-,pam,10
57119,"Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands. [Pam laughs]",jim,29
57121,"How are you, Isaac? You have something in your ear.",pam,10
57123,"Yes. It is. And thank you so much for setting up this opportunity, I really appreciate it.",pam,17
57125,Thanks.,pam,1
57126,"You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.",jim,9
57127,"Wait, are you saying that into the phone or are you saying that to me.",pam,15
57128,[touches headset] Call you right back. What were you saying?,jim,10
57129,Ha ha.,pam,2
57131,"I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it.[Pam laughs] OK, good luck!",jim,22
57132,Bye.,pam,1
57134,"In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.",dwight,13
57136,"Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.",dwight,24
57138,"No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.",dwight,17
57142,I knew it!,andy,3
57144,You and Erin are fuhhhhhhherraaaaa!,andy,5
57146,No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You're fired!,andy,14
57148,"Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry. [singing] So you had a bad day-",andy,36
57150,..The camera don't lie!,andy,4
57152,You're being an idiot get..,andy,5
57154,"Out of my office, turns out you're fired...",andy,8
57156,Because you suck.,andy,3
57158,And you're fired...,andy,3
57160,So you had a bad day...,andy,6

57164,Rut tit doh doh...,andy,4
57166,Rut ti doh doo doh,andy,5
57169,No.,andy,1
57171,Nellie was a professional grudge. This is a purely personal grudge.,andy,11
57173,"They already have a contract? [Reading] 'Mutually agree to-' Ah, every phrase is like a dagger in my crotch.",andy,19
57175,"Well, I'm not signing away my rights.",andy,7
57177,"Ok, well we'll see about that. [crumples paper]",andy,8

57190,You'll see. Here we go.,dwight,5
57192,Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off.,dwight,13
57194,Let's get to it.,dwight,4
57196,Give it a whirl.,dwight,4
57199,I need you to hose my aunt.,dwight,7
57201,OK you are useless.,dwight,4
57203,Give me the hose!,dwight,4
57205,Ahh! OK!,dwight,2
57207,Yes ma'am.,dwight,2
57223,[Mouths] Oh my god.,pam,4
57224,"Thank you! Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend.",andy,28
57226,Ugh.,andy,1
57229,That doesn't matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I don't care if they're Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet's boss also had feelings.,andy,46
57231,What?!,andy,1
57233,[wipes nose] Sorry.,andy,3
57235,My whole life is a booger bubble!,andy,7
57237,"Yeah, I've seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I've actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-",pam,25

57245,Yes.,pam,1
57247,"Two children, yes.",pam,3
57250,Kinda painful to chat with you Pete. Ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole. Translation: penis. Translation? My manhood.,andy,22
57252,"Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now.",andy,8
57254,Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in.,andy,6
57260,"Yeah, so life gives you lemons and you've just gotta eat them, rinds and all. And if you don't want to eat them? Your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So that's fun.",andy,42
57262,I am not pr-,pam,4

57295,Love you.,pam,2
57328,Hi.,andy,1
57330,"Hi, how's it going?",andy,4
57332,Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?,andy,19
57334,Awkward.,andy,1
57336,[high pitched] Really uncomfortable situation.,andy,5
57338,"It's alright Pete, you can handle it. I mean we all just gotta 'move on'. Ain't that right professor lecture much? Uh, question. How's that medicine taste? Your own flavored? Is it just me or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm. [leaves]",andy,42
57349,And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.,dwight,9
57351,By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?,dwight,11
57353,Would you like the stink sack?,dwight,6

57367,Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.,jim,30

57369,"Alright. So, tell me all about it.",jim,7
57370,"Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you.",dwight,16

57374,"Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey.",dwight,14
57376,I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you.,dwight,42
57378,Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine.,dwight,13
57382,"Hey, love turds. Conference room, now.",andy,6
57383,Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyone's day?,andy,15
57385,"Really? Hmm. That's interesting. Because Erin and Pete thought it wouldn't be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item?",andy,33
57389,"And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch.",andy,10
57395,"We'll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you?",andy,14
57427,"Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better? [Erin & Gabe and Alice & Pete argue in background] Yeah. Yeah, it does.",andy,32

57441,It's fascinating.,jim,2
57442,He said he can't help but tear up when he looks at it. It's like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.,pam,29
57443,"That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right?",jim,10
57444,Mmhm.,pam,1
57445,"So, next interview has to be better.",jim,7

57465,"Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close?",pam,9
57466,"I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.",dwight,27
57467,My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt.,dwight,20
57468,My condolences.,jim,2
57469,Keep them.,dwight,2
57470,"OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?",jim,10

57478,OK. That's not... [tosses red dirt in Oscar's face],dwight,9

57555,"We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness.",dwight,56
57557,I don't think we should eat Packers' cupcakes. We can't give him the satisfaction.,pam,14
57559,"We can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity?",pam,31
57568,Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart?,pam,15
57571,"So, it really is just about the cupcakes.",pam,8

58079,"Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale.",dwight,15
58082,"Don't worry, it's just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. It's just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker.",dwight,23

58930,"When Jim decided to come back to Scranton full-time, I was relieved, but I also feel a little guilty. I mean, he's giving up this big thing for me. But he seems happy. I mean, he's certainly been goofing around a lot. I love goofy Jim.",pam,46

59133,Pam.,jim,1

59139,You did not force me to do this.,jim,8
59140,"Yes, I did.",pam,3
59141,I don't know how else to tell you.,jim,8
59142,I'm afraid that you're gonna resent me and I'm afraid that',pam,11
59143,Resent you?,jim,2
59144,This is not enough for you and I'm afraid that I'm not enough for you.,pam,15
59145,Is that really what you think?,jim,6
59146,"Not enough? I don't know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it's against the rules but I'm gonna need a favor from you guys.",jim,31

59214,Okay. [takes Phillip who immediately stops crying] You ever been in a manager's office before?,dwight,15
59215,"Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It's called 'Schrute or Consequences.' You're gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?",dwight,41
59217,"Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you're no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.",dwight,25

59543,"Jim, it's fine. He'll just get you on his cell phone and then that'll go viral.",andy,16

59615,Good old Mose. [laughing],dwight,4
59616,They think it was Mose.,jim,5
59617,"Oh, great. He's getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung.",dwight,18
59619,"A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose.",dwight,33
59620,Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you'd ever set foot in in this town?,jim,35
59621,Right. Which one is that?,dwight,5
59622,"Mm, hey driver. Why don't you take us to 3030 Adams?",jim,11

59636,"Okay, just talk.",jim,3
59638,I heard you say 'well' the first time.,dwight,8
59639,I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow's his wedding day. You can't be anything but happy on your wedding day.,jim,30
59640,It was nothing personal. It's just that you were terrible at your job.,dwight,13
59642,"No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.",dwight,26
59644,That's it.,dwight,2
59646,I missed you Kevin.,dwight,4
59648,Ohh.,dwight,1

59655,No. We can't see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.,dwight,21
59656,Right.,jim,1

59663,"No, no, I'm fine.",pam,4
59664,Doesn't seem like anyone cares about us anyway.,jim,8
59666,I'm sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.,andy,19
59669,I'll go talk to the manager. Maybe we should just go home. [walks down the hall],andy,16
59672,Ree-De-De-De-Doo!,andy,1
59675,With today's modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it's our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.,dwight,37

59679,She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that's fine.,jim,14
59681,O-Kay.,jim,1
59683,[pause] I'm sorry. Is there a question?,pam,7
59686,"Oh, um, well, you know, I' I just' I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you'd been filmed for nine years of your life, there'd be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.",pam,40
59694,"Um, you know what, I actually didn't handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.",jim,21

59742,"Oh, come on. I've never heard of such a thing.",dwight,10
59743,"I haven't heard of it, obviously. But I'm out because I am significantly younger than you-",jim,16
59744,Not' significant is a big word',dwight,6
