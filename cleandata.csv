4727,"what do you say , jan ? ",michael,5
4729,"ok . you just , uh , clear your head . ",michael,7

4734,"smallville . and that is why , i feel , that i deserve this raise . ",dwight,13

5380,"no , no . shake it off , everybody . just , let's do secret santa . ",michael,11
5381,"presents are the best way to show someone how much you care . it's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say , 'hey , man , i love you this many dollars worth . '",michael,33

5412,we don't do anything until michael gives us further instructions . ,dwight,10
5413,i got it ! we are going to turn secret santa into yankee swap . ,michael,13
5414,what is yankee swap ? ,jim,4
5415,"one person chooses a gift . the next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift . if your gift gets stolen , then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift . ",michael,35

5449,"sucker ! see , i wanted somebody to take it . boom ! reverse psychology . ",michael,11
5450,"reverse psychology is an awesome tool . i don't know if you guys know about it , but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid . works like a charm . ",michael,39
5451," 'in addition to these paintball pellets , your gift includes two paintball lessons with dwight schrute . '",michael,17
5452,"you and me , michael . yes ! ",dwight,5

5455,"michael keeps bragging about his ipod , but you know what ? two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as i am is worth easily , like , 2 grand . ",dwight,26

5473,maybe because you hated her present so much . ,pam,8
5474,come on ! i think that yankee swap was a big hit ! i think it's a success and i'm the one who ended up with dwight's stupid paintball pellets . ,michael,28
5475,"yeah , but , michael , the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people . ",jim,14
5477,"well , i didn't . i got a big bonus because i fired devon , and i used the money to buy something awesome . sue me ! ",michael,23
5479,how much ? ,pam,2

5492,no . i want it . i'm going to use it . ,dwight,9
5493,you don't even drink tea . ,jim,5

5495,okay . . ,jim,2
5496," . . and pouring it directly into your nose , like so . ",dwight,11
5497,"to think that my gift for pam will be used for that , it's a little too much to handle . ",jim,19
5499,i know . it's totally going to change the way i work out . ,pam,12
5501,so what are you going to get me instead ? ,pam,9

8567,company policy . if drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours . ,dwight,18
8571,"okay , attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled . instead , i will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection . ",michael,25

8586,"oh , okay . well , michael wants to see everyone in the conference room . but you know what ? we have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation . ",pam,54
8588,it has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about . ,michael,21
8592,"no , uh , no . that was a test . i was testing you , and you all failed . miserably . when i said that dwight was a narc , how many of you defended him ? how many of you said , 'hey , you know what , he's right ? what he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs . '",michael,55
8593,"thank you , michael . ",dwight,3
8594,"i am ridiculously anti-drug . so anti-drug that i am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion , or testing of any kind . ",michael,22
8597,"are these facts scaring you , or are they not ? ",michael,9

8612,"uh , hmmm . ",pam,2
8614,wow ! he really pulled out the big guns . fake crying . did not expect that . ,pam,14
8615,"the point i'm trying to make with all of this people is that i hate drugs . i hate them , and based upon what i have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as i do so you are going to have a drug test , and i am not . ",michael,50
8616,"no , you will be tested . ",dwight,5
8617,"yes , i will not be . ",michael,5
8618,you will be . that is the law according to the rules . ,dwight,11

8774,no . ,pam,1
8776,"yeah , i mean it's inevitable . i definitely overhear some wedding preparation , but i'm fine with it . she hears me arranging my social life . and we both have to hear dwight order deer urine over the internet , so it evens out . ",jim,40

8816,okay . . . what ? ,michael,2
8818,"yeah , well . . . that's not gonna fly here . because in this office , it is till death do us part . . . assuming we don't get downsized . uh , pam , will you get angela and meet us in the conference room please ? ",michael,41
8819," a mediator's tool chest . okay , well , before we get started , you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict . my shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style . ",michael,35
8821,"no . okay , this is important . the first style is lose/lose . ",michael,10
8823,"just hold on , please ! okay , if we do lose/lose , neither of you gets what you want . do you understand ? you . . . you would both lose . now i need to ask you , do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation ? ",michael,38
8825,"win/win is number four and number five is win/win/win . the important difference here is with win/win/win , we all win . me too . i win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work . ",michael,31
8826," okay , since this is the disputed poster . now , one at a time , i want you to express your feelings using 'i' emotion language and no judging or 'you' statements . ",michael,33
8828,"come on , seriously , that ? ",michael,4
8830,"okay , okay . stop , stop , stop ! let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win . ",michael,20
8831,win ! ,pam,1
8832,"yes . thank you , pam . how about angela makes the poster into a t-shirt , which oscar wears . that way , he can never see it and whenever she looks at oscar , she can see it . win/win/win . ",michael,34
8835,"okay . . . well , brainstorm . own the solution . ",michael,6
8838,"how about , angela can keep it up on tuesdays and thursdays ? ",pam,11
8839,"okay , that is called a compromise . and it is style 3 . and it is not ideal . to sum up , win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt , win/lose - take the poster down , compromise - tuesdays and thursdays . and the answer is . . . make the poster into a t-shirt ! win/win . ",michael,49
8840,win . ,pam,1
8843, it is done ! ,michael,7
8844,win,pam,1

8864,"oh , he's sure . just shoot . ",dwight,5

8867,nice . ,pam,1
8868,you will notice that not one of these complaints is against me . ,michael,12
8874,"oh , ok . there were a bunch of complaints about dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago . ",michael,21
8875,"whoa . . wha . . . wait . if someone has a problem with me , why would they withdraw it six months ago ? ",dwight,18

8891,that is not true . redact it . redact it ! ,dwight,8
8892,"well , i'm not actually making a formal complaint . i just really think we should talk about it . ",jim,17
8893,"okay , question . when a name is withdrawn , does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in new york ? ",dwight,22
8895,stanley . ,michael,3
8896, hey . thanks for ratting me out ! ,pam,16
8897, you got a lot of anger under there buddy . come on start us out . unleash it . ,michael,19

8900,"someone complained that the men's room is 'whites only' . stanley , you know that's not true . ",michael,15
8903,"okay , phyllis . you complained that angela's giving you dirty looks . and you tried to get off the party planning committee . ",michael,20

8969,"cage matches ? yeah , they work . how could they not work ? if they didn't work , everybody would still be in the cage . ",michael,21
8970,"okay , so dwight , in your own words - 'someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons . i suspect jim halpert . ' 'everyone has called me 'dwayne' all day . i think jim halpert paid them to . '",michael,43
8971, yes ! five bucks each . and it was totally worth it . ,jim,11
8973,"that actually took a while . i had to put , uh , more and more nickels into his handset , till he got used to the weight , and then i just . . . took 'em all out . ",jim,32
8974," 'every time i typed my name , it said 'diapers' . '",michael,10
8975,"just a simple macro . you know , these actually don't sound that funny one after another . but he does deserve it , though . ",jim,21
8976,"by the end of the day , my desk was about two feet closer to the copier . '",michael,16
8977,"yeah , i just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom . and that's how i spent my entire day that day . ",jim,24
8978,"the japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage , where they dig into your body , very hard . and it is very painful . and apparently , some people throw up . but the next day they feel great . i've never had one . they sound awful . ",michael,41

9022," let's pay mr . price gouger . okay . . . we can do this . come on , everybody . all right . here we go . ",michael,32

9024," one , two . . didn't say three , did i ? ",michael,14
9025,"but , i'm sort of an expert at photoshop , so it turned out fine in the end . when people work together , there is going to be conflict . you can't outrun your problems . ",michael,31

9028,"oh , thanks . ",jim,2
9029,and that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing . but here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage . and that is something toby will never understand . ,michael,36
9079,excuse me . how long is the wait for a table for two ? ,jim,12
9080,"i would never , ever serve you . not in a million , billion years . ",dwight,12

",dwight,58
10545,"i would like you all to clear your schedules this afternoon , because i am telling corporate to send in a grief counselor . we need to find out what is blocking you . and that way , we'll be able to honor ed the way he deserves to be honored . may he rest in peace . ",michael,52

12245,"he was already dead . and we schrutes use every part of the goose . the meat has a delicious , smoky , rich flavor . plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator , thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease . ",dwight,50

17187,blink once if you want me to pull the plug . ,dwight,10
17192,"are you a doctor , or a male nurse ? ",dwight,8

17212," i know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering meredith's life by hitting her , with my car . but it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened , dwight endangered her life , by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it . ",michael,58

17239,i know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts . ,michael,14
17241,"ok , well back in olden times , a large fat person , like this , was a person of power . a person who had money , could buy food , person of respect . like the regional manager of the day . whereas , someone athletic and trim , like myself , was someone who worked in the fields . . . and i was a peasant . ",michael,54
17243,"well , you're going to have to run , or you're going to be in a lot of trouble . it is not olden times anymore . ",michael,23

17263,then i'm gonna end fast . ,pam,5
17264,why won't more people do that ? ,jim,7
17265,cause they're just stupid . ,pam,4
17266, what ? ,jim,4
17267," oh , ah . . . no that's not . . . i mean that wasn't , ah . . . ",jim,21
17268,yeah . . . that was um . . . ,pam,4

17270,"yeah , i gave him a ride home because . . . ",pam,8

17274,"ah , yeah . we haven't told anybody , but it's going really great . right ? ",pam,15
17275,it is going really great . ,jim,5
17276, oww ! ,dwight,5
17278,"you're taking this out on me , but i was only the messenger . ",dwight,12
17280, you'll feel better after the 5k . exercise is good for depression . ,dwight,12
17282,"we have raised , almost $700 . 00 , most of it from me and jan . um . . . when do they put that on the giant check ? or is that something that we write in later ? ",michael,31
17283,"well a giant check costs about $200 . 00 to make up . i have a print shop standing by but . . . what do you think michael , that's over 25% of our funds ? ",pam,29
17284,hmm . . . that's a tough decision . um . . . i always imagined it with a giant check . so . . . ,michael,15
17285,"yeah , i mean i personally am definitely on board for the giant check . ",jim,13
17286,giant check it is . ,pam,4
17287,yeah . ,jim,1
17288,yep . ,michael,1
17289,"well i don't know , on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control . ",dwight,17
17290,bat birth control,jim,3
17291,"wait , this money is going to bat birth control , right michael , that's what you told me when i contributed . ",dwight,19
17292,you didn't contribute very much . i was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor . and how's that been going ? ,michael,23
17293,"not well . a doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700 . 00 , or $500 . 00 if we go with the giant check . ",pam,22
17294,which we are . ,jim,3
17295,and also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor . ,pam,11
17296,what about a rabies nurse ? ,michael,5
17297,i don't think so . ,pam,4
17298,"you know what though , i've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour , for parties and bachelor events . ",jim,22
17299,that's possible . look into that . ,michael,5
17300,"great , it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah . . . oh actually more with tips . ",jim,16
17301,maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for meredith's son . ,dwight,15
17302,have you met that kid ? he's not going to college . ,michael,10
17303,"michael , 5k means 5 kilometers , not 5 thousand miles . ",pam,10

17321,see how i did that . that's the way you should enter a room . you knock and then you wait for the all clear . ,michael,23
17322,you couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room ? ,jim,12
17323,"yes , but i have an office , so why would i do that . ",michael,12
17324,"on average , how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office ? just ballpark . ",pam,16
17325,european offices are naked all the time . ,michael,7

17329, gross . ,jim,2
17331,alright . ,jim,1
17332,they say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked . i do not recommend this strategy . try picturing them with more clothes on . . . or a funny coat . ,pam,29
17333," oh , i'm sorry , is this a working office , and not a french beach ? ",jim,17
17340,"check that out . look at me , i'm toby , i'm stretching , i know what i'm doing . why is he even here ? ",michael,23

17986,that's not gonna change his mind . he's moving on . we had our chance and we killed it . ,dwight,17
17987,"look . . . we're also coming out with a website soon . it's a state of the art thing , it'll be up and running , it's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier . ",michael,33

19567,how about darryl ? ,pam,3
19568,"actually , i'm a little concerned about having a black person do the music , because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a . . . celestine prophesy , and keep the next bon jovi from ever picking up a piano . ",michael,39
19569,"michael is on a mission to prove that he's creative . which i think is odd , because michael actually might be the most creative person i've ever known . every day , michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before . ",jim,45

19928,right . ,jim,1
19929,"in the wilderness . it's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents . it's one guy , or two guys , if your plans change . ",michael,24
19930,not gonna change . ,jim,3
19931,"i wanna do it myself . you know , i want to go and , and find out something about myself , i wanna get outta here . all the cliques , and the office politics . fluorescent lights . asbestos . ",michael,33

19934,"when jan and i had satellite , we used to watch a reality show called 'survivorman . ' and , it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die , try not to get eaten by an animal , or be overexposed . ",michael,52

19941,"dwight and i are going out . he will return later , but i will not . i will also be taking a personal day tomorrow , and perhaps the next day . ",michael,28

19957,"no , i would never leave you for dead . you would never escape . ",dwight,12
19958,"well , yes i would . and i would survive . ",michael,8
19959,i would make sure that you were dead . ,dwight,8

19961,"first , i would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified . ",dwight,17
19962,you . . . ,michael,1
19963,and they would call me the overkill killer . ,dwight,8
19964,you . . . you are as creepy as a real serial killer . for real . ok . ,michael,17
19965,what are you doing ? ,dwight,4
19966,"i am putting this on so i have no familiarity with my surroundings . now this way , i can't retrace my steps . i don't know what streets we've been--- ow ! what are you doing ? ",michael,39

19972,"oh , wasn't it just someone's birthday ? ",jim,6
19974,"i do remember , yeah . ",jim,4
19976,"you know what , i have an idea . why don't we just do one big shared party ? ",jim,16
19978,"there are thirteen people working in this office , so thirteen times a year michael gets a cake and balloons , and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast . there are two types of toasts . one is a joke about how old you are . ",jim,44
19979, look at those wrinkles . blacks do crack ! not crack the drug . ,michael,15
19980,"and the other is something inappropriate . or horrible . or both . what else ? he only sings the high harmony to 'happy birthday . ' and he's a very big believer in surprise parties . maybe even , arguably , possibly to a fault . ",jim,37
19981, happy birthday ! ,michael,10
19983, happy birthday ! ,michael,11
19985, happy birthday ! ,michael,11
19987,"so . . . i think , yeah , i think getting these out of the way might be productive . ",jim,15
19988,"we can just have one big fun party . everybody's happy , nobody wastes their time . ",jim,14
19990,"wow ! you're shaking things up a bit , huh ? ",pam,8
19991,"it's a pretty good idea , don't you think ? ",jim,8

20772,"i didn't have anything , jan . ",jim,5
20774,i'm sorry . she scares me . ,jim,11
20775,"michael's dinner party is for couples only , which is why i wasn't initially invited . but that was then . i very recently entered into a serious , monogamous relationship . if that idiot ever gets here . ",dwight,38
20777,where did you grow up ? ,pam,5
20778,it's been a rough couple of weeks . ,michael,7
20780,"little trouble . yes . well , jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift . ",michael,14
20781,"wow , you did neighborhood watch ? ",pam,5
20782,yes . ,michael,1
20784,"so she's passed out , and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors' dog . . . ",michael,15
20786,and the neighbors blamed jan . ,michael,5
20788,"it's like , you know , the dog shouldn't have been outside in the first place . anyway , it's a tragedy , really , because the paint is not gonna come off the dog until it sheds . . . ",michael,33
20790,so . . . ,michael,1
20792,well . ,michael,1
20794,what's that ? ,jim,2
20799,w . b . jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get . ,pam,22
20800,so we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there . ,jim,12
20801,which just means we get to see more of our lovely street . tell them what we saw today jim . ,pam,19
20802,"oh today , we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken . ",jim,15
20803,nature . ,pam,1

20807,some of us like the walk more than others . ,pam,9
20809, did you pick a new chair ? it's been awhile . ,pam,18
20810,"pam , when i first opened this catalog , i thought i was just going to be picking out a chair . ",michael,19
20811,"but instead , you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair . ",pam,14
20812,"michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago . and normally i wouldn't care , but he promised me his old one . it's way better . it's one of these . i really want it . ",pam,49
20813, have you ever seen this woman ? ,michael,10

20817,"look at her smile . those eyes , look at her eyes . she's got - i don't know what it is actually , she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch . ",michael,43
20818,or in a great chair . ,pam,5
20819,"oh , yeah , maybe , but remember after my dinner party when i said that i was swearing off women ? ",michael,18
20820,i definitely remember your dinner party . ,pam,6
20821,i think what i meant was that i was completely swearing off one woman . jan . i think that fate put this catalog in my hands . ,michael,26
20822,"actually , i put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair . ",pam,17
20823,what is it like being single ? i like it . i like starting each day with a sense of possibility . and i'm optimistic because every day i get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results . ,michael,38
20824,"ladies and gentleman , would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85 . ",michael,18
20826," no , he hasn't picked one yet . ",pam,8
20829,"i am ready to start dating again . getting back on the market . so , fyi , for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends , use the woman on page 85 as a template . that will be all . ",michael,43
20830,i left my cell phone in my car . ,andy,8
20832," listen man , i am completely over jan , so , would you set me up ? ",michael,15

20851,"is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer ? could we share a row boat ? could , could a row boat support her ? ",michael,22
20853,i think i'm being very clear what i'm asking . would an average size row boat support her without capsizing ? it bothers me that you're not answering the question . ,michael,29
20855,"damn it , i knew it ! i knew it phyllis ! ok ! ",michael,10
20856,what is wrong with these people ? i would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry . ,michael,20
20857,"dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me , but it is and you know why ? because nobody here is willing to help me . nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request , would it ? well , fine . here goes . ",michael,41
20860, write legibly people . ,dwight,7

21646,"no , okay . . . i've had enough of you . ",michael,7

21681,"you just , do , and i don't know why , so . . . please help me understand . ",michael,13
21683,"well stanley , maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well . ",michael,17
21685,"all right , you don't respect me . i accept that . but listen to me , you can't talk to me that way in this office , you just can't . i am your boss . can't allow it . ",michael,33
21688,"so i'm thinking , as a reward for our loyal clients , that we contact their assistants , and we find out where they live . and then , we go to their houses , in the middle of the summer , and go caroling . it is a summer christmas sale-abration . and we call it , a summer sales-a-lot . feedback ? anybody ? stanley ?

21706,"it's complicated , pam . i mean , the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk . ",michael,17
21707,"well , i actually agree with her , i think you should talk to him . and you also might want to explain to andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash . ",jim,38
21709,okay . ,michael,1
21710,"i put stanley on a pedestal , for a long time . but sometimes he can just be a big , fat jerk . i . . . jerks don't deserve to be on pedestals . jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are . big marble . . . jerk stand . ",michael,50

30149,and i won't . ,jim,3

30155,i have a very difficult decision to make . it's like last week i was at the video store . do i rent devil wears prada again ? or do i finally get around to seeing sophie's choice ? it is what you would call a classic difficult decision . ,michael,48
30156,"you don't understand clothing , toby . you're dressed like this amorphous blob of khaki . ",andy,14
30158,"listen up , flenderson . you're being weak and ineffectual . i'm cowboying this meeting , okay ? here are the new rules . earth tones only . also , women are forbidden to wear pants . ",dwight,33

31428,welcome . ,michael,1
31429,thank you . i've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings . ,jim,13
31430,mm-hmm . ,michael,1
31431,"and i'm wondering if perhaps those are a bit , um--",jim,10
31432,disruptive . ,michael,1
31433,yes . ,jim,1
31434,"no , i don't think they are . i think the meetings are very important . ",michael,13
31435,"okay , maybe we should talk specifics . ",jim,6
31436,let's do . ,michael,2
31437,"okay . yesterday , we had a meeting about planets . ",jim,8
31438,"n-- well , to be fair , jim . . . james . . . jimothy . . . to be fair , jimothy , the-- ah , that sounds weird . are you okay with being called jim ? ",michael,24
31439,i am . ,jim,2
31440,"alright . jim , to be fair , the conversation wasn't about planets . . . ",michael,10
31441,right . ,jim,1
31442,"at first , we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper . and what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon ? so you draw a line from there to the other planets , and i think by the end , we all learned a little bit about how small we are . ",michael,53
31443,"yes , i agree . ",jim,3
31444,"because it's a big universe , and we're all just little , tiny specks of dust . ",michael,14
31445,i just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day . ,jim,12
31446,"you know what eats a large amount of the day are naps . you go to sleep , it's light out , you wake up , it's dark . that's the whole day . where did that day go ? i have no idea . ",michael,37
31447,you mean on a weekend ? ,jim,5
31448,yes . ,michael,1
31449,how about this ? i think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential . ,jim,17
31450,alright . no more meetings this week . ,michael,6
31451,really ? you just agreed to that ? ,jim,6
31452,i can be very suprising . ,michael,5
31454,"i need to fit into my wedding dress . however , i'm also pregnant . ",pam,12
31457,"we did , but mostly because people expect us to . we're also accepting other gifts not on the registry . . . however much . ",pam,20
31458,"it's awkward asking people for money , but we could really use it . why doesn't crate & barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash ? ",pam,26
31460,"oh , good . ",pam,2
31462,"no , we're not . ",pam,3
31464,mm-hmm ? ,michael,1
31465," okay , i thought i saw people missing . ",jim,19
31466,"yeah , just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks . got one of each . ",michael,14
31467,"really ? hey , stanley , what was the last thing michael said before i came through the door ? ",jim,16
31468,"stanley , you don't need to answer that . ",michael,7
31469,stanley ? ,jim,1
31471,"okay , michael , i thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these . ",jim,16
31472,what do you mean by 'these people' ? ,michael,7
31473,"michael , this is a conference room meeting . ",jim,7
31474,"oh , hey , everybody , i think that jim has gone insane , because he thinks that my office is a conference room . ",michael,20
31475,that's not what i meant . ,jim,5
31476,"listen , jim , no offense , but when push comes to shove , what i want is more important that what you want . ",michael,20
31477,i disagree . ,jim,2
31478,what do you guys think ? ,michael,12
31479,"great . guys , can i just have a moment alone with michael ? ",jim,11
31480,"no , no , no , you don't need to go anywhere . anything that jim has to say to me , he can say in front of these types of people . ",michael,27
31481,"that is not what i said , and , also , i am co-manager , meaning you are not the only manager anymore . i am also i co-manager . ",jim,24
31482,that is not what wallace told us . ,michael,7
31483,that's exactly what wallace told us . ,jim,6
31484,that is not the way i heard it . ,michael,8
31486,"it is one thing , me giving you the co-manager title . it is another thing , you bossing me around . ",michael,18
31487,"i'm not bossing you around . i'm trying to do my job , which is sharing your job , so maybe we should just call david wallace . ",jim,24
31488,"no , no , no . no , we will not call david wallace . i will call david wallace . ",michael,21
31490,or david wallace will call us on line two . why don't we just--,michael,13
31491,"hey , david . you got jim here . ",jim,6
31492,"hey david , this is michael , senior co-manager . ",michael,7
31494,"got it , dave . sounds like your classice big-picture decision . ",michael,9
31495,which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees . ,jim,10
31497,which is it more of ? ,michael,5
31499,"david , i know that i'm very new at this , but i have a very good perspective on how things work . ",jim,20
31501,i thought maybe we could talk after this is over . ,michael,10
31503,"nope , not at all . ",jim,4
31504,"no , it will not be . i am on top of it . ",michael,11
31506,"alright , thanks alot , david . ",jim,4
31507,"talk to you later-- okay , you didn't let me say good-bye . alright , i am looking forward to this . ",michael,26
31508,you don't have to lie . ,jim,5
31509,"i hate the fact that we have to do this together . i think we work better separately . when i am irritated and i look at you , i don't see you anymore . ",michael,31
31510,right . ,jim,1
31511,all i can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are . ,michael,15
31512,alright . let's get started . ,jim,4
31515,"you know , there's no easy way to do this . i say we add 1 . 5% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it . ",michael,23
31516,"do you mean , like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll ? ",jim,17
31517,"no , we can do it during the day . it doesn't have to be that dramatic , jim . ",michael,16
31518,okay . you know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options . ,jim,15
31519,"jim , don't take this the wrong way . are you gonna take this the wrong way ? ",michael,15
31520,it's hard to tell so far . ,jim,6
31521,you use your brain too much . ,michael,6
31522,"i'm sorry , are you advocating that i use it less ? ",jim,10
31523,sometimes the smartest people don't think at all . ,michael,8
31524,you just came up with that . ,jim,6
31525,as i was saying it . ,michael,5
31526,"yeah . okay , so for the 1 . 5% increase , pro-- everyone gets a little bit . ",jim,13
31527, con-- you look like a nerd . ,michael,9
31528,con-- no one gets as much as they did last year . ,jim,11
31529,pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds . ,michael,14
31530,pro-- no favoritism . ,jim,3
31531,"con-- you unzip your pants , and you find that there's a calculator down there . ",michael,14
31532,"i've been studying michael for years , and i've condensed what i've learned into this chart-- how michael spends his time . as you can see , we have procrastinating and distracting others , and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking . i made it bigger , so that you could see it . ",jim,53
31534,i don't think we registered anywhere . we just want cash . ,pam,10
31536,mm-hmm . ,pam,1
31538,yeah . ,pam,1
31540,okay . ,pam,1
31542,is this what i've become ? materialistic ? shallow ? i feel horrible . oh look ! 'mrs . pam halpert ! ' that's the first time i've seen it in writing ! ,pam,29
31543,"you know , the more i think about it , the more i think we should give it to the salesmen . ",jim,19
31544,that will not go over well . ,michael,6
31545,"i know . i just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now . 'course i know that this might come off as biased , so you know what ? let us . . . ",jim,31
31546,"oh , my god ! are you gonna make another pro and con list ? i'm gonna kill myself . ",michael,16
31547,i'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking . ,jim,9
31549,michael . ,jim,1
31550,and then another--,michael,3
31551,"look , you have a lot of strengths . ",jim,7
31552,"oh , i do ? ! tell me what they are . ",michael,8
31553,i think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well . ,jim,12
31554,ha ! that-- i am not known for that ! ,michael,8
31555,but there is a reason why i'm here ! ,jim,8
31556,yes ! you went over my head to wallace ! ,michael,8
31557,"no , it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses , michael ! ",jim,11
31558,"okay . well , why don't you tell me what those are , jim ? why don't you enliven me ? ",michael,16
31559,i don't think you're good at making tough decisions ! ,jim,9
31560,ah . ,michael,1
31561,"at thinking out the options , and then stating that decision very clearly , especially when it's an unpopular decision . ",jim,18
31562,"okay , here's a tough decision for you . you suck ! you suck ! is that clear enough for you ? ! ",michael,17
31563,"but maybe i'm here for a reason , because i might have some good ideas , too . i've been sitting out there , and i've been learning a lot , and maybe i can just bring something different to the table . ",jim,37
31564,"okay , skippy , here we go . why don't you run yourself out there and tell them ? you call it . ",michael,19
31565,,jim,7
31566, this had better be terrible . ,michael,8
31569,"look , you guys are smart , so i'm just leveling with you . i'm just trying to treat you like adults . ",jim,19
31573,"ooh , easy . that's not it at all . ",jim,7
31575,"really what it is , is about the money the sales staff brings into the office . ",jim,15
31581,this is ridiculous ! how could he do this to us ? ! ,dwight,10
31582,"okay , dwight , you know what ? you'd be getting the raise so--",jim,11
31583,"what about all these people , huh ? ! how is it fair to them ? ! ",dwight,12
31591,"her kid needs shoes , jim ! ",dwight,5
31593,"wow ! i'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit , so . . . ",jim,23
31597,my plan-- a man-- panama . ,michael,5
31598,that's not how that goes . ,andy,5
31600,"thank you , meredith . ",jim,3
31603,"alright ! let me get this clear ! does everybody want a raise ? alright , everyone wants a raise , so what we're going to do is go into here , and we will not come out until we do . ",michael,38
31606,what about a raise based on merit ? ,michael,7
31607,rank each person individually ? ,jim,4
31608,"mm-hmm . piece of cake . ryan , obviously the best . ",michael,8
31609," well , obviously . too bad he's a temp and doesn't count , so let's get started . ",jim,23
31610,are you making a--,michael,4
31611,nope . i'm numbering the paper . ,jim,5
31616, and jim ! ,dwight,8
31618,i think it was creed . ,dwight,5
31620," it's going really well , actually . ",jim,7
31621," each boston baked bean represents half a percent raise . we each got 24 beans , so the idea is , you place the bean on the picture of who you think deserv-- who's that ? ",jim,52
31622,toby . ,michael,1
31623,he's not a part of this . you know that . ,jim,9
31624,just wanted to draw a picture of him . ,michael,8
31625,"okay , your move . ",jim,3
31626,alright ! who to pick ? who to pick ? ,michael,11
31627,here we go . ,jim,3
31628,i . . . will skip a turn . ,michael,5
31629,"okay , you're gonna still have to play that bean . you know that . ",jim,12
31630,i need more time . ,michael,4
31633,"come on in . that's right . come in , feast your eyes . they determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces . ",dwight,34
31635,things were not this bad when just michael was manager . ,dwight,10
31636,"hey , what are you guys doing in here ? ",michael,8
31638,"why aren't there any beans on this very old , frizzy-haired picture of me ? ",pam,13
31640,jim ? ,pam,1
31641,i was just trying to be unbiased . ,jim,7
31647,there's no way that stanley gets more beans than me . that is ridiculous . this is how it works . ,andy,35
31649,"thank you ! that is exactly-- by the way , i would also like a raise . ",andy,14
31653,"no , i mean , what do you say to my plan ? okay . ",dwight,13
31654,,michael,7
31656, how you doing ? ,michael,6
31657,"uh , on a scale of one to ten , i'd say i'm about a four . ",jim,14
31658,"oh , what are you usually ? ",michael,5
31659,six . you ? ,jim,2
31660,"usually a ten , but i'm feeling like a zero . ",michael,9
31661,"i mean , a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea , right ? ",jim,11
31662,"i know , i know . ",michael,4
31663,we tried to find the fairest way to do it . ,jim,10
31664,"yes , we did . ",michael,3
31665,i just-- what ? ,jim,3
31666,"um , nothing . i just . . . i used to have to do this part alone , and it was the worst . i have something i would like to give you . ",michael,29
31670, michael's my only friend left in the office . except pam . . . i think . is she still upset ? ,jim,18
31672, thank you . ,jim,10

31687,"i'm sorry . you guys have probably noticed my stomach's a little more sensitive lately . so , if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less perfume . . . and if your lunch is especially pungent , maybe have it in the break room ? ",pam,38
31688,we would really appreciate it . ,jim,5
31689,pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy . if she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed . it's amazing . a three ounce fetus is calling the shots . it's so bad ass . ,dwight,34
31690,"phyllis , if you could switch to a different soap , just for a month or two ? yours is kind of perfumy . ",pam,20
31692,"oh , gee , i'm sorry . i guess i missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant . no ! i reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk . ",dwight,33
31694,i don't think i'm asking for too much . i guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace . ,pam,19
31696, what do you think ? i spent all morning on it . ,michael,20
31697,it is really special . ,jim,4
31698,"yeah , but aren't you supposed to do that to our . . . no . it's great . ",pam,13

31707,come on . you've got to be kidding me . ,dwight,8
31708,ok . all of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding . ,pam,25
31709,absolutely . 'cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended . ,jim,11
31711,"well , we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned . ",pam,14
31713,that's nice . ,jim,2

32528,well i don't see that happening . ,andy,6
32529,me neither . not the way things are now . but what if michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy ? ,dwight,19
32530,are you saying-,andy,3
32531,yeah . . . ,dwight,1
32532,that we surgically remove the fear center from michael's brain ? ,andy,10
32533,what is wrong with you ? i am talking about convincing michael that the guy's not mafia ! ,dwight,16
32534,that seems a little far-fetched . ,andy,5
32535,well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown ? and that happened . ,dwight,19
32536,michael . incredible news . grotti is clean . ,dwight,6
32537,no . he's not . he's just good . nothing sticks to him . you still don't understand how this works . ,michael,17
32538,"no , michael . what we're trying to say is , we made a mistake assuming he was mafia . i have a buddy who's a fed , and we did a background check on the guy . his background is perfectly clean . ",andy,38
32539,"it's true , he's clean . i have a couple of friends still on the force . checked with them . ran his fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take . turns out he's a totally lovely guy . sweetest guy on the force really . ",dwight,45
32540,class act . boy scout . ,andy,4
32541,but grotti acts like he's mafia though . ,michael,7
32542,he's trying to intimidate you to close sales . he's just a pushy salesman . ,andy,13
32543,and he made us all look like chumps ! ,dwight,8
32544,,michael,1
32545,"if there is one thing i hate more than the mafia it is a liar . i wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars . bury them in my yard . and i wouldn't tell the cops a thing . not that i would be lying per se . but i would just get really quiet , all of a sudden . ",michael,59
32547,this is scott . ,michael,3
32549,oh really ? is that supposed to scare me ? ,michael,8
32551,well you thought wrong . because i am not pleased . i'm actually kind of po'd . ,michael,14
32553,"i think you know exactly why , because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance . ",michael,16
32555,i think you knew exactly what you were doing . and frankly i think you were being a total and utter jerk . ,michael,21
32556,whoa . okay . ,andy,2
32557,you suck ! ,michael,2
32558,okay that's-,dwight,2
32559,and i'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance . ,michael,8

32563,doubt it . ,michael,4
32565,what a tool . what ? ,michael,9
32566,"next time you look in the mirror , you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia ! ",andy,19
32567,no . what do you mean ? ,michael,5
32568,"we just told you he wasn't mafia , so you wouldn't be scared . ",dwight,12
32569,what ? ,michael,1
32570,you successfully backed down the mob ! ,dwight,6
32571,you made the mafia apologize to you ! you made the mafia be polite ! ,andy,13
32572,oh man . i should be mad at you guys . but i'm not . ,michael,12
32573,"so i looked him in the eye and i said , 'not today grotti , not today . and not tomorrow , and not the next day . or the day after that . and you can tell all your friends that if i see them , then they're already dead . ' i said something like that . ",michael,49

33735,"i'm a little worried i might have asked out naughty nellie and not erin . which would be a whole lot less appealing , because naughty nellie says yes to everyone . and she might be a murderer . ",andy,37

35024,did it ? it might have come up while we were waiting for you . ,jim,13

35159,"jo , i don't know how things work in florida , which from your description sounds like a colorful , lawless swamp , but here it takes two men to do one job , where in florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job . ",michael,44

35209," i , uh . . . ",dwight,4
35212,"so , check this out . according to the handbook , you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager . they have all these incentive programs . i ran your numbers from last year . ",pam,33
35213,this is way more than i make now . ,jim,8
35214,"i don't think i'm gonna miss being manager . you know how some people say they're not in it for the money ? well , with all due respect to this job , i think i'm definitely in it for the money . and quite honestly , the women . ",jim,43

35241,really . ,jim,1
35242,"yeah . you can take the man out of the salesman , but you can't take the sales out of salesman . ",michael,19
35244,"no , i really , really think michael is better at being manager for so many reasons . ",jim,15
35245,"no , i think i would be bad . i would sleep in my office , and i would sexually harass people . ",michael,19
35246,why would you do that ? ,jim,5
35247,i'm turning myself in right now ! ,michael,6

35283,the new it guy . nick . ,dwight,5
35285,"i think he is the key . he's very trusting , he's looking for friends , he has been given an awesome amount of power , and does not know how to wield it . ",dwight,30
35287,"why don't you just let me handle the tolkien references , okay dumb jock ? ",dwight,13
35289,smeagol was corrupted and became gollum . ,dwight,6

35315,"ho-ho . there he is , the it guy . so you discovered the break room . ",dwight,13

37118," 'hey , erin , you look delicious . i mean , beautiful . '",pam,11
37120,"what ? what do you mean , suspend me ? ",pam,7
37121,i think you need to go a little easy . you can't just suspend someone form work . ,jim,16
37123,"wait , what ? i was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making . ",dwight,9
37126,why would that be something to talk about on secretary's day ? ,andy,11
37127,"andy , she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with . all right ? and besides , who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them ? that's like . . that's like mr . and mrs . smith crap . ",michael,45
37128,"i was going to tell her , just on my own time . ",andy,11
37129,"you know what , i resent the implication that i would keep that secret . everyone here knows that i can't and won't keep a secret . ",michael,24
37130,"who cares ? i mean it's not like i killed someone . big deal right ? this can blow over in two seconds . she never asked me . so , if you think about it . . . i probably should have told her i guess . everybody does stupid things . ",andy,42
37139,hey . you know i was engaged before jim . ,pam,8
37141,yeah . and he worked here too . ,pam,6
37143,"no , no it wasn't andy . it wasn't . it doesn't matter . it's not about who you've been with . it's about who you end up with . sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants . ",pam,38
37145,thank you . ,pam,7
37147, hey toby . ,pam,4
37149,very interesting . ,pam,2
37151, thanks toby . ,pam,5
37153,i don't think an apology is enough . i really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension . ,pam,24
37154,"and i got to take this bad attitude , and i got to go home , and i got to adjust it . and i hope the suspension does that . ",jim,27
37155," prideful idiots . watch how it's done . gabriel , i apologize . ",dwight,26
37157, i kneel before you . ,dwight,8
37159,humbly taking your hand upon which i kiss to show my contrition . ,dwight,12
37162,"will you stop walking for one second ? that's it . there's no other secrets . ok ? i mean yeah , my chest is not naturally hairless , and my parents pay my credit card bill . ",andy,31

37193,"ahh ! you said it ! you know who you would love ? oh , this guy in my neighborhood , tom dizemore . this is him: 'hey ! hey scott ! '",michael,24
37194,"sometimes telling someone something is hard . well , at least someone made her happy on secretary's day . ",andy,16
37198,"yeah , i mean , the count has a very distinct voice . ",jim,10
37199,yeah . 'i vant to count to ten' . ,pam,7

37207,"buenos dias , erin . ",michael,3
37209,"no , no , no , no . solamente en espanol , por favor . ",michael,9
37210,"i believe that every man , woman , and child in this country should learn how to speak spanish . they are our neighbors to the south , and this would be a healing thing for . . . for all of north america . and . . . i am going on vacation next week to cancun . ",michael,47
37211,"buenos dias , jaime . ",michael,3
37212,"buenos dias , miguel . como estas ? bien ? claro que si ! yo estoy fantastico . que pasa ? ",jim,14

37224,yo soy cancun . ,michael,3
37226,"all right , so i'll finish up on bulk pricing , and then you go into delivery guarantee . ",jim,16
37227,"you know , maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there , like , um . . . like , 'i just delivered a baby . they didn't offer me a guarantee . '",pam,26
37228,"yeah , or maybe we don't even need that . ",jim,8
37229,can you smell the power of the halperts ? power couple . ,michael,10
37230,"you know what ? i should be getting this client , michael . my numbers are better than either of theirs . ",dwight,18
37231,i went with the people i thought would put the best face on the company . ,michael,15
37232,"if you want people to put the best face on something , why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives ? ",dwight,29
37233, that's a good point . ,jim,5
37234,this is our first joint sales pitch . i think we're gonna work really well together . ,pam,15
37235,yeah i think we have complimentary strengths . we understand each other . ,jim,11

37243,did somebody order a hooker over here ? ,michael,7
37245,hi . how are you ? ,michael,4
37246,"there's this woman i met a few weeks ago . her name is donna , the manager of sid & dexter's and , right now , we're in the midst of a passionate love affair . um , no . but she is coming by today . maybe to buy some printers , so . . . ",michael,45
37247,"right here , we have the wonder twins , jim and pam halpert . they will be assisting you today . ",michael,17
37249,"oh , no we're actually married . we're not brother and sister . ",pam,10
37251,all right . ,jim,2
37254," so , yes , laser printers are more expensive . but they cost less to operate so it's a tradeoff . ",jim,22
37255, hi . ,michael,3
37256,hold on one second . ,jim,4
37257,"sorry to interrupt . sorry to interrupt . do you , donna , by any chance shop at victoria's secret ? ",michael,16
37258,what ? ,jim,1
37259,because i keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me . ,michael,24
37260,none of this is time sensitive . ,jim,6
37261,"uh , yes , uh , the sale is on now through may . ",michael,10
37263,"okay , i have more of them . ",michael,6
37266,what is this ? ,dwight,3
37268,"it doesn't just sound a'ight , it sounds amazing . ",dwight,8
37270,how do i apply ? ,dwight,4
37272,"uh , glasses wearers . cholera survivors . geniuses . non-organic family farmers . the list goes on and on . you want me to keep going ? ",dwight,21
37274,come here . come here . ,dwight,4
37276,"ten seconds ago , this guy was driving a forklift . okay ? now all off a sudden he's cinderella of the office . what are you guys thinking ? ",dwight,25
37279,"one minority from this branch is going to get into this program . who would i refer ? hmm . . . the competent , hardworking one who does things his own way , or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines ? ",dwight,40
37281,"oh , man . white people , right ? ",dwight,5
37283,"well , you can kinda tell from the voice . ",dwight,8
37285,"i bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot , just because of your race . ",dwight,16
37287,i think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program . ,dwight,12
37289,"i know , 'cause you have no role models . how many indian ceo's can you think of ? ",dwight,16
37291,you could be the indian bill gates . you could be the indian ted turner . ,dwight,14
37293,that's not . . . she's . . . okay . yes . ,dwight,5
37294,"i took the liberty to scan a few things earlier , and i want to show you . . . there we go ! whoa , look at those vivid colors . look at my eyes . those are shrek-green eyes . that is me again . i think this displays the crisp , dazzling white . ",michael,53
37296,"and that would be a display of the crisp , gorgeous black . ",michael,24
37298,"it's subtle . that's how it works . i show her an image that turns her on . and then she looks at me , then back at me , then back at the image . soon , she doesn't know what is me , what is the image . she just knows that she's turned on . ",michael,48
37299,this is a place that i like to go to be alone with my thoughts . i've never taken anybody there before . ,michael,21
37301,ryan . ,michael,1
37303,and that's it . that's me . that's who i am . ,michael,9
37305,"oh , thanks . you're not bad , either . ",michael,7
37307,hmm . ,michael,1
37309,jim ! could you come in here for a sec ? what was that printer we were looking at ? ,michael,17
37310," you didn't see it , pam . she was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move . shortbread ? ",michael,25
37311,no . ,jim,1
37312,i'll have one . ,pam,3
37313,"well , maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work . ",jim,10
37314,"oh really , jim ? what about pam ? and you did a heck of a lot more than kiss . maybe this could be my pam . ",michael,23
37315,"okay . well , all that is irrelevant . ",jim,6
37316,"maybe michael has a point . i mean , if she was really that upset , she wouldn't still be here . ",pam,18
37318,"look , i know that i screwed up in there . i know that i probably messed up your sale . i just want to go in and fix it . ",michael,27
37319,what if i back out and you finish the pitch with jim ? ,pam,12
37320,what ? ,jim,1
37321,what was that ? ,jim,3
37322,just let him flirt with her . people meet each other all sorts of ways . ,pam,14
37323,"pam , you know he's not gonna get anywhere , and he's gonna blow our sale . ",jim,14
37324,who cares ? it's not that huge a sale . ,pam,16
37325,"hey , the schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale . ",jim,16
37326,"don't act like you understood anything that guy said . good luck , wingman . ",pam,16
37327,how as being a minority affected you ? ,dwight,7
37329,"oh , good , and you resent this because . . . ",dwight,7

40119,"stop it ! stop , stop . we're thinking . we're thinking about it . ",michael,10
40121,"you don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it . stop it ! just let us think . okay , next time you have a really great idea , we will put it in a hat , and then we will have erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide . ",michael,51
40124,i am not budging on the hat issue . ,michael,8
40126,okay . we both reserve the right to go to jo if we disagree with gabe . ,michael,15

40149,stop . ,jim,1
40150," um . . . kay . uh , alright . ",michael,7
40151,one of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough . ,pam,21
40153,"oh , no , it's just that if a vampire had to cough , he would do it like this . ",pam,20
40154,uh-huh . right . and ruin their cloaks ? do you have any idea how expensive wool is in transylvania ? 'cause of the euro . ,dwight,24
40155,"well , other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly . don't come in if you're sick . ",pam,27
40156, uh . . . ,dwight,8
40157,"and get your flu shot . also , i'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office . ",pam,17
40158,"no , no , no . they will cost you your life . ",dwight,9
40159,elaborate . ,jim,1
40160,"the worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it . they need to fight their own battles . if sabre really cared about our well-being , they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations . a simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt , vomit , fecal matter . . . ",dwight,47
40161,i'm not - i'm not going to do that . i'm not going to do that . ,pam,15
40162,exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger . ,dwight,12

40164,yes . i would welcome it . ,dwight,5
40165, you're welcome . ,jim,8
40166,"the principle is sound . to avoid illness , expose yourself to germs , enabling your immune system to develop antibodies . i don't know why everyone doesn't do this . maybe they have something against living forever . ",dwight,33

45052,you wouldn't dare . ,jim,3
45053,"watch this . you're pre-fired . and when i'm promoted , you'll be full fired . ",dwight,12
45054," if you get promoted , and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then . ",jim,16
45055,what ? ,dwight,1
45056,"if i had thought that there was a real chance that dwight would be permanent manager , i would have pre-quit . and you might be saying to yourself , 'well that's pretty premature to think , ' but i always say , it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared . ",jim,42
45057,"how you doing , jordan ? ",dwight,4
45059,"everyone here thinks that you're a joke . they think that you were hired because of your good looks , which won't last long anyway . as your pale skin and severe bone structure imply , you'll age swiftly and poorly . ",dwight,37

45065,"dwight , guns make me really uncomfortable . ",andy,6
45066,"the gun is just an accessory to the holster , okay ? i can't walk around wearing an empty holster . ",dwight,18
45067,why do you need to wear the holster at all ? ,pam,10

45183,jo . . . i accidentally fired a gun in the office today . ,dwight,10
45185,"i am telling you this because i care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly . all i've ever wanted was to be manager here . and if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident , i understand . but if you think that extortion is worse -",dwight,53
45187,"it was a beaumont-adams , if that helps . ",dwight,7

45206,shut up . ,dwight,2
45207,"well , you do know that jo was right to take the job away from you , right ? there's no debating that . but , i will say . . . in your one week , every single one of the orders went out on time . and i think that is shagadelic , baby . ",jim,55
45226,he never called a meeting . ,jim,5
45228,what are we doing ? ,pam,4
45232,we need a new manager . ,pam,5
45233, your paper experience is very interesting . do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here ? ,jim,20
45235,really ? ,jim,1
45237, . . . what is it ? ,jim,8
45244,you could just be saying it to get the job . ,jim,10
45246,"how about this . why don't you give us a part of the plan , and that way we know you have it . ",jim,21
45248,okay . ,jim,1
45250,did you just trademark that . . . ,jim,5
45261,,andy,24
45263,"the manager job ? nah , i'm barely interested . i just can't not go for it . you know , it's not the bernard way . we give it the old college try , and then , in defeat , we show grace . ",andy,35
45265,don't even . . . eeehhhh ! ! ! ! ,andy,8
45267,eeehhh ! ! no . hehe . ,andy,3
45268,"in my family , you don't really go out and get things . if you want something , you write it on a list , and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it , on wednesdays and fridays . so , i don't know , i guess you could say this job is on my list , and . . . we'll see what rosa comes back with . ",andy,59
45278, should you really be so blatant about that ? ,pam,16
45279,"they won't make me manager , and i won't settle for anything less . i've gone about as far as i can here . that's obvious . time to take my talents elsewhere . ",dwight,29
45280,are you really going to apply for work at scranton breadworks ? ,pam,11
45281,bread is the paper of the food industry . you write your sandwich on it . ,dwight,14
45283,"unfortunately , that range is set at corporate . ",jim,7
45285,heh . we think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous . ,jim,11
45297,"can you . . . you are a man of great confidence . could you speak a little more to that , and , what the role of confidence . . . would be . . . in a dialogue with a subordinate ? ",jim,35
45299,yes . ,jim,1
45301,yes . ,jim,1
45303," he creeps me out . but , i think he might be a genius . ",jim,35
45304," good luck , darryl . ",andy,12
45307, oh . ,jim,9
45314,"well , for instance , how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight ? ",jim,17
45317," so i think all we need is a resume , and we'll be good right ? ",jim,17
45319,"yeah , it's no big deal , just something that looks like that . cool ? ",jim,22
45327,what makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview ? what are you doing . . ? stop trying to figure me out . ,dwight,31
45329,you can't . ,dwight,2
45331,"no , it's not . ",dwight,3

45335, get out . ,dwight,4
45336,"i'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak , passionless leadership . do you see my hat ? no ? that's because i just threw it in the ring . ",dwight,31
45340,can i ask why you're leaving your current job ? ,jim,9
45342,is this a bad time to be doing this ? ,jim,9
45348," it's gorgeous , angela . ",pam,11
45355, oh-ho-ho ! he talked about himself in the third person ? ,pam,10

45361,"okay , guys , it's time . it's pep talk time . tell me what i need to hear . ",andy,15
45363, augh . ,andy,2
45365,"so , andy , what improvements would you make as office manager ? ",jim,10
45366,"for starters , i really think we can streamline communication around here . . . ",andy,16
45368,"i wasn't acc- , accusing . . . ",andy,4
45370,"right ! i really wasn't trying to insult any , anyone . ",andy,9
45374,what ? ,andy,1
45376,okay . let me think . . . are you counting car windows ? ,andy,9
45378," uh , 93 million miles . ",andy,5
45379, is it ? ,jim,4
45380,"yeah ! and the diameter of the sun is 870 , 000 miles , which makes it 109 times wider than the earth , and . . . 333 , 000 times heavier than the earth , . . . ",andy,30
45382," i am unhappy with the confusing and , at times , confrontational nature of that meeting . i wanted it to go better . i wanted it to go better ! ! ",andy,30
45385,how is this on me ? ,pam,5
45386,hang up . corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture . intel has told us there were at least seven . ,pam,35
45388,they're the same picture . ,pam,4
45390,"your department's just you , right ? ",jim,5

45408,no . ,jim,1
45409,"now , listen , . . . ",dwight,2
45410,"you're not getting an interview , dwight . the whole point of this search committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again . ",jim,23
45411,"okay , i know why you're saying that , jim , i really do , but think of it this way . the hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat is the strong hand you want on the wheel . ",dwight,42
45412, okay . that's vivid . ,jim,7
45413,"i'm going to make you an offer . okay ? you even do so little as grant me an interview , i will guarantee you your dream work life . okay ? you roll in at 10 a . m . to your own private reserved parking spot , pick up your daily free coffee from dwight's caffeine corner , unlimited sex breaks for you and pam . . .

45417,ha ha ! ,dwight,7
45418,"unfortunately , jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment . so how would that look for me , if i recommended you ? ",jim,26
45419,"fine . i'll do it without you , but you'll regret this . ",dwight,10
45420,okay . ,jim,1

45474,i think that's probably all we need to hear from . . . ,jim,10

46525,and it's clear we're not going to carry them . ,dwight,22

46615,"yeah , why is it so far away jim ? ",dwight,8
46616,so this warehouse has been around for what ? like a thousand years ? and they never thought to back the truck up into it ? i guess sometimes it just takes a fresh set of eyes . alright ! ,jim,40

47283," oh , there's one mistake . ",dwight,7

47587,thank you . really you guys thank you . very sweet . ,pam,9
47590,really well thank you all . ,pam,5
47594,ok ok ok no no no . this is disgusting . you realize what you're saying ? the hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman . ,dwight,26
47596,no ! there are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction . and you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman . ,dwight,24
47598,yes you are . and another thing . helen mirren was born helen mironov . that's right . you're fake salivating over a soviet era russian . ,dwight,22

47632,"i'm not asking if you're in to her . just , objectively , do you find her attractive ? ",pam,15
47633,"and i'm telling you , i don't . ",jim,6
47634,you don't find cathy attractive ? ,pam,5
47635,"no , i don't . ",jim,3
47636,"no , i'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that i find her replacement objectively attractive . just like i'm not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun . it's true , but it doesn't help anybody . ",jim,41
47637,look at her . even i want some fries with that shake . ,pam,11
47638,"okay . uh , i don't . so are we good ? ",jim,10
47639,that's just absurd . ,dwight,3
47640,"yes , because she's hot , right ? ",pam,5
47641,"her breasts are large , her waist is small , her reproductive health in ample evidence . and facial symmetry- come on . ",dwight,19
47642,"the thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently . like you're a kid almost . they lose all sense of boundaries . they start acting weird , telling you things that clearly aren't true . i know it sounds nuts , but i think dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth . ",pam,49
47643,"dwight , am i hot right now ? ",pam,6
47644,"why would i or anyone else think that you're hot right now ? i can't impregnate you , and that's the driving force between male-female attraction . ",dwight,24
47645,what about before ? was i attractive before ? ,pam,7
47646,"meh . . . you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight , gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time . gradual recovery and , uh , well now , obviously , you're at an all-time low . ",dwight,40
47647,hmm . i think jim's lying to me about not being attracted to cathy . ,pam,13
47648,you think jim's lying ? that's so cute . i know he's lying . ,dwight,12
47649,five bucks if you can get him to admit it . ,pam,10
47650,done . i never touch a pregnant woman . ,dwight,13
47651,"yep , that's the dwight i need . ",pam,6
47652,"if we're going to work together , we need some ground rules . ",dwight,11
47653,okay . ,pam,1
47654,rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth . ,dwight,9
47655,i think so . okay . ,pam,4
47656,rule two: we stop at nothing . ,dwight,6
47657,"well , what does that . . . is that . . . okay . ",pam,7
47658,rule three: don't fall in love . ,dwight,6
47659,"yep , good . ",pam,2
47660,we're gonna bust this guy . ,dwight,5
47661,honesty is very important to me . ,pam,6
47662,so important . and then we will destroy the man himself . ,dwight,10
47663,let's just see how we feel when we get there . ,pam,10
47665,none taken . what do you got ? ,dwight,6
47667,hmm . ,pam,1
47676,"yeah , absolutely ! ",andy,2

47690,"mike tibbets , really ? ",pam,3

47695,touche ? ,jim,1
47697,"kelly , calm down . ",pam,3
47699,i don't think jim cares about his hair . ,pam,8
47701,i don't see what's so ugly about him . he's got the broad face of a brewer . ,dwight,16
47702,jim's on to me . ,pam,4
47703,hmm ? ,dwight,1
47704,"yeah , jim barely talks to mike . we had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile . jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it . ",pam,34
47705,just ugly enough to have deniability . ,dwight,6
47706,yep . ,pam,1
47707,"mike tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy i know . so if that was for the matchmaker test , i think i'm in the clear . if that wasn't for the matchmaker test , then . . . cathy , he's a really nice guy . ",jim,38
47708,"well , jim may be lying with his words , but he can't lie with his body . ",dwight,15
47710,"no , kelly , don't . ",pam,3
47711,"the male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs . the puffing of the chest , mirroring , increased blood flow to the crotch . i say we start there . ",dwight,27
47713,with the crotch . ,dwight,3

47717,exactly . ,dwight,1
47719,"okay , just shut it . ",dwight,4
47720,is he puffing out his chest ? ,pam,6
47721,i can't tell . it's unnaturally sunken . busted . he just was mirroring . did you see that ? ,dwight,21
47722,no . maybe he just said something funny . ,pam,7
47723,"jim has no discernible sense of humor , pam . you should know that . ",dwight,12
47724,i think he's just making her laugh . ,pam,7
47725,time for me to find out . ,dwight,6
47726,why's he making her laugh so much ? ,pam,7
47727,"just going to walk over here- whoa , whoa , i'm slipping and falling ! oh , stumbling , i need something to grab on to ! ",dwight,26

47750, yeah ? ,pam,3
47751,you okay ? ,jim,2
47752,why won't you just admit that she's attractive ? it's kind of annoying that you won't say it . ,pam,17
47753,"okay , what can i do to make you believe me ? ",jim,10
47754,"well , dwight had this idea , and i thought it was kind of crazy . but maybe that's where we are now . ",pam,20
47755,"she called it crazy ? aw , man , that's insulting . all i did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test . monitoring his blood pressure , pulse , perspiration , and breathing rate . ",dwight,26
47756,"yeah , its nuts . but i don't know what else to do . ",pam,11
47757,and she called it nuts ? ,dwight,5

47775,si . ,jim,1
47776,"wait , that's it ? that's the question you're going to ask him ? ",pam,11
47777,we have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is . ,dwight,14
47779," well , that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten . ",dwight,12
47780,"okay , dwight , come on . you can go first . ",jim,11
47782,"jim , are you serious ? ",dwight,4
47783,"oh , you know what ? this reminds me , cece needs a new toothbrush . ",jim,12
47784,maybe we could switch instruments . ,andy,5

47796,"do you really , tin man ? okay , where were we ? ",dwight,9
47797,"no , i'm not worried . because this lie isn't for me , it's for pam . and when she gets her body back and her confidence back . . . yes , i will tell her the truth . that i had feelings for a co-worker today that i haven't had in years . but in my defense , he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time .

47803,really ? ,pam,1
47804,"pam , are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test ? ",jim,11
47805,"i would listen to my homemade test , because your husband is definitely lying . in fact , he's lied about every question . even his name . who are you really ? ",dwight,27
47806,"wait , what ? ",pam,2
47807,"look at the numbers . every single time , it's come up 150 over 100 . your husband is a pathological liar . ",dwight,19

47864,false alarm . ,pam,2
47865," what ? ! they took another client from us ? okay , bye . man ! business is war ! customers , clients- it's like a war out there . ",andy,24
47866,i am a leader . but you can only inspire people so much in a place like this . so today i'm turning the inspire-factor up to ten with a little help from my friend america's bloodiest battle . ,andy,36
47867,why even read business books ? we should be studying war . going to places like gettysburg . where is that ? ,andy,18
47869," well we should take a fieldtrip there . i mean , that would be so cool . i wonder if that bus downstairs is-",andy,23
47871,that sounds super inspiring ! i'm in ! ,andy,6
47872,gettysburg ? hmm . could be interesting . second-most northern battle in the civil war . ,dwight,12
47874,ha ! ,dwight,1
47875,the civil war history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of schrute farms . whatever . i'm over it . it's just grossly irresponsible . ,dwight,23
47876,charge ! ,andy,1
47878,"yeah , well , the bus has free wifi and i made special low-sugar lunches for everyone . and is anyone kosher or halal ? ",andy,21
47880,"dates , tabbouleh , and a bagel with cream cheese . ",andy,8
47882,"you know , it's the same as the kosher option . there's a lesson in there . i mean , i can't force you to go . you're not my slaves . thanks to gettysburg . but . . . who's coming with me ? ",andy,34
47885,guess i'm a sucker for historical fiction . ,dwight,7
47886,"anyone who's not going , you're dead to me . you're uninvited . i don't want you to come . but , fyi , there will be leftover turkey and pesto sammies in the fridge . ",andy,29
47888, one for you . ,andy,6

47891,cool . thanks . ,jim,8
47892,"and- oh . you missed your head . there you go . phyllis , think fast ! ",andy,19
47893,"all right , guys , a little foreplay before we do it . fans of ken burns' jazz will most certainly enjoy civil war . ",andy,21
47896,"it's just not appropri- i mean , if we were going to visit bradley cooper's birthplace , i'd be the first one suggesting it . i'd be rooting for it . ",andy,27
47898,"all right , all right , all right . ",andy,6
47900,here . like it ? ,pam,3

47924,"yeah , we're not going to the visitor center . we're not tourists . ",andy,11
47925,"no , of course we're not tourists . we're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour . ",jim,18
47927,unless you're going on the very specially-created and meticulously-researched andy bernard tour . ,andy,12
47928,"after chancellorsville , lee brought his army up the shenandoah valley , right through here ! they stopped in this field for a picnic , which they called lunch . ",andy,25
47930,"total deaths belongs to gettysburg but when you're talking about d . p . a . , that's deaths per acre . . . ",dwight,15
47932, . . . nothing beats the battle of schrute farms . ,dwight,7
47934,"oh , it is . and you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home . i mean , it makes the battle of gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush . i'm telling you , they're heartbreaking too . so beautifully written . ",dwight,44
47936,the truth . ,dwight,2
47939,"no , no , no ! you're filling her head with nonsense . you and the history books . i'm telling the truth . ",dwight,18
47941,"yes , thank you . all of history has been whitewashed . ",dwight,9
47943,"okay , i will . i don't know who that is , but i'm gonna tell you this-",dwight,15
47945,"gettysburg was very important . credit where credit is due , okay ? big , mad props to gettysburg . was it , however , the most northern battle of the civil war ? ",dwight,26
47947,not by a long shot ! ,dwight,5
47950,"no , it was not ! ",dwight,4
47952,"no , it was not . was it the second-most northern ? ",dwight,9
47954,sure ! i will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle ! ,dwight,10
47956,"was it the northernmost ? no . get out of here , oscar . ",dwight,10
47972,"excuse me , i got a question for you . ",dwight,8
47974,can you tell us about the battle of schrute farms ? ,dwight,10
47976,"really . okay , follow-up question . how much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut ? ",dwight,15
47978,we don't need to bother this poor gentleman . i know exactly where we're going . giddy up ! tallyho ! ,andy,17
47985,"okay . you know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools . i was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us . . . and as , you know , as i tell it , i don't like it . unless , of course , you are responding to it . ",pam,53
47987,"um , excuse me . i'm gonna go to the bathroom . ",pam,9
47988,"at this point , when you're this pregnant , it's kind of like senior spring . the other day i spit my gum out on the carpet . ",pam,24
48002,"by the way , did we leave all the food on the bus ? ",jim,12
48003,let's talk about food for a second . food for thought . ,andy,10
48004,"yeah , that's what i had for breakfast and i think that's probably why i'm still hungry . ",jim,16
48005,hunger ! hunger for victory ! hunger for honor . hunger for pride . ,andy,10
48010,only two hundred dollars ? ,jim,4
48013,"get the flag ! get the flag ! come on , big tuna . what you gonna do about it ? we got a flag right here . wee-hoo ! ",andy,23
48014,spangler springs is a mile this way . ,andy,7

48016,its' i mean come on . ,andy,5
48018,alright fine . you know what ' i guess this place just hasn't rubbed off on you the way i hoped it would . i'm still going . and i'm not going to ask anymore . i'm not even going to look back . i'm just going to assume that you're with me . ,andy,53
48019, you said you weren't going to look back . ,dwight,15
48025,really ? ,dwight,1
48027,well . anyone employed by the gettysburg industrial complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the battle of schrute farms . ,dwight,23
48030,yes ! ha ! prepare to be refuted ! go on . ,dwight,11
48034,hallowed ground . ,dwight,2

48056,yeah sorry everyone else didn't come . i think they're just tired . with holes in their shoes . and they have dysentery . ,jim,23
48057,even without an audience you're still at it . ,andy,8
48058,what are you talking about ? ,jim,5
48059,our office has a disease . and it goes by many names . sarcasm . snark . wisecracks . you take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes . that's what you did with this trip . ,andy,44
48061,you don't like the hats ? ,andy,5
48062,they're terrible . ,jim,2
48064,"they just didn't turn out how i wanted . in my head they were cooler , but they do look weird . ",andy,20
48072,charge ! ,andy,1
48075,"it's kind of a haul , so we should probably get going . and tuna , i made a special sandwich for you , guess which kind . ",andy,23

48082,"getting everyone on the bus , check . giving everyone hats , check . sexiest eastern european girls , uh , check . ",andy,16
48084,please ! everyone and their mother goes to devil's den . it's the olive garden of gettysburg . ,andy,15
48086,"well , i meant that in a bad way . obviously it tastes good , but it's not cool . ",andy,16
48087,where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground ? ,jim,14
48088,that is what i'm showing you . ,andy,6
48089,"i know what you guys are all thinking right now: hey , let's go pee on the grave of some confederate soldiers , but you know what ? joke's on you . it only makes the flowers grow back more beautifully . ",dwight,37
48090,"best thing you can do for the deceased is to pee on their graves . then you dance and work the urine into the root systems . doesn't hurt to have a smile on your face , either . ",dwight,35
48093,it's locked . ,jim,2
48095,"it's not locked , gimme that . . . ",dwight,5

48349,"that's the thing . see , i didn't want to get in the middle of this . still don't . but here's something: i feel that maybe , if we take a step back , this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse . ",jim,41

49374,okay . ,jim,1
49375,"i did get called in to jury duty . and they released me around noon , so , didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day . and then the next morning pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so i took an extra day to help out . and then three other days happened . ",jim,58
49388,"aw man , i would but i can't miss any more work . ",jim,11
49395,"come on , judge judy , tell us your case . what were the deets ? ",andy,12

49400,"wow , i'm really sorry . ",jim,4
49402,i never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder . the least i could do is give them a good story . ,jim,24
49403," so phyllis , he was here , and then the car came and did- he was like that . yeah , so it had to be a double backflip , actually . ",jim,33
49405,"oh man , ernesto's . that was our favorite restaurant too . ",jim,9
49408,"i was in los angeles last year . jim tricked me into thinking i'd won a walk-on part on ncis , but that's not important . while i was being kicked off the lot , i saw food trucks everywhere . everyone in los angeles eats from them . and nobody calls them restaurants . ",dwight,48
49424,"so this whole hit and run thing , there's just one part i can't figure out . you said it was at a four-way stop . . . ",dwight,23
49425,mm-hmm . ,jim,1
49426,and the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane ? ,dwight,22
49427,mm-hmm . ,jim,1
49428,"see , that's what i'm having trouble with , because the fact is , you never said he was on a bicycle . busted , halpert ! ",dwight,23
49429,"okay , wait , wait . ",jim,3
49430,"yes ! andy , get out here . ",dwight,5
49431,no . i never said he was on a bicycle . i just said i wasn't listening to you . ,jim,17
49432,i am making a citizen's arrest . you have the right to remain silent . you have the right to beg for mercy . you have the right to request judgment by combat . dwight's rights . ,dwight,32
49433,"what's up , gangstas ? ",andy,3
49434,jim was lying about jury duty . he was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing . i don't know what this pervert likes . fire him ! ,dwight,30
49435,"dwight , not everything is a conspiracy theory . ",andy,7

49439,"here , right there . down the hatch . ",andy,14
49440,i really don't want to take the chill pill . ,dwight,12
49441,"attaboy . good . now , chill . ",andy,4
49442,"okay , okay . but let's just say that jim was lying about jury duty . you would have to fire him , right ? ",dwight,22
49443,"yeah , sure , of course . i'd fire him to timbuktu . ",andy,12
49444,that's good enough for me . ,dwight,7
49445," . . . and pam was just going crazy , trying to take care of philip because cece has been out of control recently , and- look , andy , it doesn't matter . the truth is , i just feel terrible lying to you . ",jim,36
49446,i feel terrible getting lied to . no one's ever lied to me before . ,andy,13
49447,okay . i think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth . ,jim,19
49448,"no , not after what i told dwight about firing you . no . here's what we're going to do . we're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up . have you ever heard of a connecticut cover-up ? ",andy,34

49454,they used to call me king tut because i'm so good at keeping things under wraps . ,andy,16
49455,"my nickname was actually king butt , because i had a king-size butt . ",andy,12
49457,"okay , everybody , gather 'round . got a real special surprise for you . ",dwight,19

49479,"hey , murder she wrote . how about we drop the whole 'murder , she wrote' thing , okay ? jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning . how do i know ? because i drove him there . ",andy,34
49481,why ? why ? ,andy,5
49482,because my car broke down . ,jim,5
49483,"his car broke down . so he called me , 'cause i live near the courthouse . ",andy,14
49484,"wait , wait . you live by the courthouse . so you drove from near the courthouse , out to jim's house , and then back to the courthouse ? ",dwight,24
49485,"thirty minutes out , thirty minutes back , easy hour . and i would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that . ",andy,27
49487,we're getting buried out there . what was that stuff about the car breaking down ? ,andy,14
49488,"well , i think you handled it pretty well . ",jim,8

56225,what makes you think you'd be an effective paper salesman ? ,dwight,10
56227,"well , it's a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman . ",dwight,11
56229,all right . do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter ? ,dwight,15
56231,there were only two options . ,dwight,5
56233,this is a bus transfer . ,dwight,5
56236,"sure , yeah , go ahead . ",jim,4

56253,"i can't hire clark . yeah , he looks like a schrute , but he thinks like a halpert and he acts like a beesly . ",dwight,22
56254,"okay , here's one . a customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock . you can't rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party . ",dwight,43
56256,thank you . ,dwight,2
56258,"damn it ! perfect answer , again . ",dwight,5
56260,"think dwight , think . you have a ream of 16-bond '",dwight,10

56268,"oh , you think they're my only friends ? i've got way more friends than that , and they're all better than the losers who work here . ",dwight,24
56271,"well , of course not , but does physical appearance include smell ? ",pam,10
56276,"next up , my cousin mose . mose could make a great paper salesman . he's got a natural fear of paper , which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible . i've got big expectations , mose-wise . ",dwight,40
56277,what quality would make you a good sales associate ? ,dwight,9
56279,it says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for dow chemical . ,dwight,20
56281,"you know we live together , right ? ",dwight,6
56283,"and i've never seen you go to work , ever . ",dwight,9

56304,but it's dwight who's bring in all the weirdos . ,jim,9
56306,"hey , i'm the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when jim's away . i'm in a position where i'm rooting for nate , and that just feels wrong . forget it . i need to work on my mural . i have some pointy trees that i need to round off . ",pam,51
56308,"yeah , this is actually about the new sales guy . uh , dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos . and i was wondering if i could have some input'",jim,29

56311,david . ,dwight,1
56313,"really ? that's interesting . 'cause i was thinking that since jim is only here part time , he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who's here every day . and frankly , killing it lately . ",dwight,38
56314,"i was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk , near my wife'",jim,18
56316,oh . um',jim,2
56318,okay . i can't say that that's not fair . ,jim,8
56319,"sounds fair to me , david . ",dwight,5

56865,"i'd like to rat out andy . unfortunately , i have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with david wallace . except , instead of a boy , i'm a man . and instead of a wolf , i cried genetically-engineered monster wolf . ",dwight,36
56871,"fine ! the state he's in , wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway . ",dwight,17

",jim,54
56875,i didn't tell you about the crying because i didn't want you to know how upset i was . because it would've stressed you out and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress . ,pam,35
56876,"yeah , well . yeah , ok . well , then thank you . thanks to both of you . ",jim,13
56877,it's not brian's fault . ,pam,4
56878,"no , you're right . and , and i'm not mad at brian . and to be honest , i probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because i wasn't there . so , let's just forget about it . ",jim,35
56879,ok . ,pam,1
56880,i need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case david asks . just a few things i could sprinkle into conversation . any big sales or office gossip . ,andy,34

56932,"i know you may not be feeling love for me right now but , if you fake it , i won't be able to tell the difference . so , i'll feel good . and then , eventually , maybe , you'll actually start to love me again . ",andy,40
