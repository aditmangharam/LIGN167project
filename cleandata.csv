1,All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?,michael
2,"Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...",jim
3,"So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper?",michael
4,"Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.",jim
5,"All right. Well, let me show you how it's done.",michael
6,"[on the phone] Yes, I'd like to speak to your office manager, please. Yes, hello. This is Michael Scott. I am the Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products. Just wanted to talk to you manager-a-manger. [quick cut scene] All right. Done deal. Thank you very much, sir. You're a gentleman and a scholar. Oh, I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry. My mistake. [hangs up] That was a woman I was talking to, so... She had a very low voice. Probably a smoker, so... [Clears throat] So that's the way it's done.",michael
7,"I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for...  forever. Right, Pam?",michael
8,Well. I don't know.,pam
9,"If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago. [growls]",michael
10,What?,pam
11,Any messages?,michael
12,"Uh, yeah. Just a fax.",pam
13,"Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.",michael
14,You haven't told me.,pam
15,It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.,michael
16,"People say I am the best boss. They go, 'God we've never worked in a place like this before. You're hilarious.' 'And you get the best out of us.' [shows the camera his WORLD'S BEST BOSS mug] I think that pretty much sums it up. I found it at Spencer Gifts.",michael
17,[singing] Shall I play for you? Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming] I have no gifts for you. Pa rum pump um pum [Imitates heavy drumming],dwight
18,"My job is to speak to clients on the phone about... uh, quantities and type of copier paper. You know, whether we can supply it to them. Whether they can pay for it. And... I'm boring myself just talking about this.",jim
19,Whassup!,michael
20,Whassup! I still love that after seven years.,jim
21,Whassup!,michael
22,Whassup!,dwight
23,Whass...up!,michael
24,Whassup.,dwight
25,"[Strains, grunts] What?",michael
26,Nothing.,jim
27,OK. All right. See you later.,michael
28,All right. Take care.,jim
29,Back to work.,michael
31,"Corporate really doesn't really interfere with me at all. Jan Levinson Gould. [walking out of his office] Jan, hello.  I call her Hillary Rodham Clinton. Right? Not to her face, because... well, not because I'm scared of her. Because I'm not. But, um... Yeah.",michael
33,Um... Me no get an agenda.,michael
35,I didn't get any agenda.,michael
37,Really? I didn't... [looks at Pam] Did we get a fax this morning?,michael
38,"Uh, yeah, the one...",pam
39,"Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it?",michael
40,You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.,pam
41,"Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes.",michael
43,"Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you.",michael
45,OK...,michael
47,"No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent.",michael
49,All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding!,michael
51,OK. No problem.,michael
53,"Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?",michael
54,"Question. How long do we have to... [Telephone rings] Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?",michael
56,Packman.,michael
58,"Oh, that's not appropriate.",michael
60,"Uh, I don't know what you mean.",michael
62,"Oh, my God! Oh! That's... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person.",michael
64,"No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. [zips his lips] Like that.",michael
70,I have an important question for you.,pam
71,Yes?,jim
72,Are you going to Angela's cat party on Sunday?,pam
73,"Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous.",jim
74,"Am I going to tell them? No, I am not going to tell them. I don't see the point of that. As a doctor, you would not tell a patient if they had cancer.",michael
75,Hey.,michael
77,This is Mr. Scott.,pam
78,Guilty! Guilty as charged!,michael
80,"Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges.",michael
82,"Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee! [hold hand up for a high five] Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go. [Yelling in cod German] I'm Hitler. Adolf Hitler. [Continues with cod German]",michael
83,"I don't think it would be the worst thing if they let me go because then I might... I don't think it's many little girls' dream to be a receptionist. I like to do illustrations. Um... Mostly watercolor. A few oil pencil. Um, Jim thinks they're good.",pam
84,Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam.,pam
85,"Sure. Mr. Davis, let me call you right back. Yeah, something just came up. Two minutes. Thank you very much. Dwight, what are you doing?",jim
86,What?,dwight
87,What are you doing?,jim
88,Just clearing my desk. I can't concentrate.,dwight
89,It's not on your desk.,jim
90,"It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.",dwight
91,You can't do that.,dwight
92,Why not?,jim
93,Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.,dwight
94,[crosses fingers] We'll see. [Dwight begins smashing pencils with his phone] This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.,jim
95,Downsizing?,dwight
96,"Downsizing? I have no problem with that. I have been recommending downsizing since I first got here. I even brought it up in my interview. I say, bring it on.",dwight
97,You just still have these messages from yesterday.,pam
98,"Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it. [Imitating Six-Million Dollar Man sound effect]",michael
99,What?,pam
100,"Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.",michael
101,Don't we all?,pam
102,I'm sorry?,michael
103,Nothing.,pam
104,"If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional. [Sighs]",michael
105,"I think I'm a role model here. I think I garner people's respect. [Imitating a PA] Attention all Dunder Mifflin employees, please. We have a meeting in the conference room, ASAP.",michael
106,"People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable.",michael
107,Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.,michael
108,I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.,dwight
109,Assistant to the Regional Manager.,michael
110,"OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?",dwight
111,I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody.,michael
113,"Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em?",dwight
114,You don't know what it is. [Laughs],michael
115,OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.,dwight
116,I don't need your permission.,michael
117,Go ahead.,dwight
118,Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.,michael
121,Not gonna happen.,michael
123,"It won't be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that.",michael
125,On his mother's grave.,dwight
126,No.,michael
128,"Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.",michael
130,"I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.",michael
131,I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.,pam
133,"Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.",michael
134,"Pam, information is power.",dwight
136,"No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin.",michael
137,"If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.",jim
138,"Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Um... [Laughs]",pam
139,"Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp.",michael
141,Introduce yourself. Be polite.,michael
142,"Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.",dwight
143,"Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.",michael
144,"Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand.",dwight
145,That's his profit.,michael
146,"New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos.",dwight
147,Damn it! Jim!,dwight
148,"OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?",michael
149,He put my stuff in Jell-O again.,dwight
150,[Laughing],pam
151,That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.,dwight
152,"It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules.",dwight
153,What is that?,michael
154,That is my stapler.,dwight
155,"No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world [turns to camera] which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.",michael
156,"OK you know what, you can be a witness. [points to Ryan] Can you reprimand him?",dwight
157,How do you know it was me?,jim
158,It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?,dwight
159,"Discipline. Kinky! [Laughs] All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.",michael
160,Yeah.,dwight
161,"And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O.",michael
162,"OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.",jim
163,[Laughing] Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.,michael
165,Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.,michael
166,"OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.",dwight
167,Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do.,michael
168,Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?,jim
169,Yeah.,pam
170,That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.,jim
171,So when are we going out?,pam
172,"Tonight, hopefully.",jim
173,OK. Yeah.,pam
175,What's going on?,jim
177,Hey.,pam
178,Roy's my fiance. We've been engaged about three years. We were supposed to get married in September but I think we're gonna get married in the spring.,pam
179,Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?,pam
181,OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.,pam
182,You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.,jim
184,"Yeah, yeah.",jim
185,Um... What's in the bag?,jim
187,"No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.",jim
188,Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? [scratches head],jim
189,"So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third. [Knock at door] Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff?",michael
191,"You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?",michael
193,"Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to...",michael
194,You got a fax.,pam
195,"Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.",michael
196,What? Why?,pam
197,"Why? Well, theft and stealing.",michael
198,Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?,pam
199,Post-it Notes.,michael
200,"Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?",pam
201,"50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know,  you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam.",michael
202,Are you serious?,pam
203,Yeah. I am.,michael
204,I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me.,pam
205,But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.,michael
206,"[Pam starts crying] You been X'd punk! [Laughing] Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you.",michael
207,You're a jerk.,pam
208,I don't know about that.,michael
209,"What is the most important thing for a company? Is it the cash flow? Is it the inventory? Nuh-uh. It's the people. The people. My proudest moment here was not when I increased profits by 17% or when I cut expenses without losing a single employee. No, no, no, no, no. It was a young Guatemalan guy. First job in the country, barely spoke English. He came to me, and said, 'Mr. Scott, would you be the godfather of my child?' Wow. Wow. Didn't work out in the end. We had to let him go. He sucked.",michael
210,Hey.,pam
211,Hey.,jim
212,How are things?,jim
213,Good. I thought you were going out for a drink with...,pam
214,"Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?",jim
215,"It's better, thanks.",pam
216,Good. Good.,jim
217,Yeah.,pam
218,That's great,jim
219,Is...?,pam
220,Yeah?,jim
221,Um... Are you...,pam
222,Am I walking out?,jim
223,Yes.,pam
224,"Yes, I... Do you want to...",jim
225,Yeah.,pam
226,Great. Let me just...,jim
227,"[Car horn honking] Oh, Roy.",jim
228,"Yeah. Listen, have a nice weekend.",pam
229,"Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it. [looks at camera] You know what, just come here.",jim
271,"Hey, uh, can I help you out in here?",michael
273,Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rows. That's a good idea.,michael
274,"Today is diversity day and someone's going to come in and talk to us about diversity. It's something that I've been pushing, that I've been wanting to push, for a long time and Corporate mandated it. And I never actually talked to Corporate about it. They kind of beat me to the punch, the bastards. But I was going to. And I think it's very important that we have this. I'm very, very excited.",michael
275,"That's the thing. It's very sturdy paper and on the back it says, '100% post-consumer content.' What? Hello? Uh-huh. Wait. What? I'm sorry, Mr. Decker. I think I'm losing you. [Shedder whirring] Hello? Hello? Yeah. Hold on one second. I don't know. Hold on one second.",jim
276,Do you really have to do that right now?,jim
277,Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.,dwight
278,"Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks. [Power off, silence] Hello? That's it. Perfect. So what I was saying... [Dialing tone] Hello? Thanks, Dwight.",jim
279,Retaliation. Tit for tit.,dwight
280,That is not the expression.,jim
281,"Well, it should be.",dwight
282,"This is my biggest sale of the year. They love me over there for some reason. I'm not really sure why but I make one call over there every year, just to renew their account, and that one call ends up being 25% of my commission for the whole year, so I buy a mini bottle of champagne, celebrate a little. And this year I'm pushing recycled paper on them for one percent more. I know. I'm getting cocky. Right?",jim
283,Solitaire?,jim
284,"Yeah, Freecell.",pam
285,Six on seven.,jim
286,I know. I saw that.,pam
287,"So then, why didn't you do it?",jim
288,I'm saving that 'cause I like it when the cards go T-ts-ts-tch-tch-tch.,pam
289,Who doesn't love that?,jim
290,"Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man?",michael
292,Did you have a good weekend going there?,michael
294,"Oh yeah, I bet it was fun. [to Mr. Brown] Oh, hey! This is Oscar---",michael
296,"Right. See? I don't even know, first-name basis!",michael
298,"Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let's do it. Oscar works in... here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please?",michael
299,"Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please.",jim
300,"It's diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day.",michael
301,You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.,jim
303,"Come on people, let's get 'em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards!",michael
305,"You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I don't look at you as another race.",michael
307,"Exactly, were not...",michael
309,With tolerance.,michael
311,Ignorance.,michael
313,Let's celebrate.,michael
315,Celebrate good times. Come on! Let's celebrate diversity. Right?,michael
317,You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.,michael
318,I have two. White and Indian.,dwight
320,Yes.,michael
322,OK.,michael
324,A few of the ground rules?,dwight
325,"Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him.",michael
326,"OK, can we steer away from gay people?",dwight
328,"I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox.",dwight
330,I figured it would save time.,dwight
331,OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr...,michael
333,"Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that.",michael
335,"How come Chris Rock can do a routine and everybody finds it hilarious and ground-breaking and then I go and do the exact same routine, same comedic timing, and people file a complaint to Corporate? Is it because I'm white and Chris is black?",michael
337,I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off.,michael
339,"OK, I will play guy listening.",michael
343,OK.,michael
344,Kevin is a great guy. He's a great accountant. He is not much of an entertainer.,michael
346,"OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin... He's butchering it. Could you just let me... [As Chris Rock] Every time... Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass... [Bleep] I take care of my kid!",michael
348,[Bleep] They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do!,michael
350,[As Chris Rock] What you want a cookie?,michael

358,We all have a hero in our heart.,dwight
360,[Clears throat] I don't think I can sign this.,michael
362,"Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so... I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so... Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?",michael
364,Sure.,michael
366,"Here's the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. That's probably throwing you off a little bit.",michael
368,"OK, well I know. You told me that several times.",michael
370,OK.,michael
372,"Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't.",michael
374,I won't.,michael
376,"Yeah, yeah.",michael
377,"I regret my actions. I regret offending my coworkers. I pledge to bring my best spirit of honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness...' Open-mindedness, is that even a word?

379,"I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart.' I do believe... in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look... the guy, 'Mr. Brown,' he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears.",michael
380,All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It's time. Let's do some good.,michael
382,Get out.,michael
384,"No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape.",michael
385,"[on the tape] Hi. I'm Michael Scott. I'm in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I'm also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, 'If you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.' And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.",michael
386,OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim?,michael
387,": Uh, is that it?",jim
388,Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on.,michael
390,"Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um...",michael
392,"Yeah, well, if you leave we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian.",michael
394,Two fifteenths.,michael
396,"Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on.",michael
398,"Oh, yeah...",michael
400,Wow.,michael
402,"Wow. That is... That is a great story. That's the American Dream right there, right?",michael
404,"Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?",michael
406,"Well, it has certain connotations.",michael
408,Like... I don't... I don't know.,michael
410,"No. Now, remember that honesty...",michael

413,Hello? Hello?,jim
414,"I have something here. I want you to take a card. Put it on your fore... Don't look at the card. I want you to take the card and put it on your forehead and... Take a card, take a card, any card. Um... And I want you to treat other people like the race that is on their forehead. OK? So everybody has a different race. Nobody knows what their race is, so...

461,"Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.",michael
463,What?,michael
465,"That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice.",michael

604,That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.,jim
605,Really?,michael
606,"Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?",jim
607,"Any time Michael asks me to do anything, I just tell him that Dwight should do it.",jim
608,Yes. I can do it. I'm your man.,dwight

610,"OK, first, let's go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?",dwight
611,"Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan.",michael
612,"OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.",dwight

618,Thank you.,dwight
619,"If Dwight fails, then that is strike two, and good for me for, ah, for giving him a second chance. And if he succeeds, then, you know, no one will be prouder than I am. I groomed him. I made him what he is today. Unless he fails, and we've talked about that already.",michael
620,What did I do? I did my job. I slashed benefits to the bone. I saved this company money. Was I too harsh? Maybe. I don't believe in coddling people.,dwight

635,"Uh, knock, please. Please knock. This is an office.",dwight
636,It says 'workspace'.,jim
637,Same thing.,dwight
638,"If it's the same thing, then why did you write 'workspace'?",jim

640,You are not my superior.,jim
641,"Oh gee, then why do I have an office?",dwight
642,I thought it was a workspace?,jim
643,OK. Dwight. Are you really in charge of picking the health care plan?,pam
644,Yes. And my decision in final.,dwight
645,This is a ridiculously awful plan. Because you cut everything.,pam
646,"Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.",dwight
647,"You cut more than you had to, didn't you?",jim
648,Sure.,dwight
649,"Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?",jim
650,Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.,dwight
651,"OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.",jim
652,"I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.",dwight
653,Why would you want to raise your cholesterol?,pam
654,So I can lower it.,dwight
659,"Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?",michael
661,"Ah, what? Which memo?",michael
662,Dwight's health care memo. I told you about it.,pam
663,Is it a good plan?,michael
664,It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.,dwight
666,"Michael, he made huge cuts.",pam
667,"Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?",michael
668,"Yeah, you said...",dwight
669,"No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?",michael
670,I can handle that.,dwight
671,"OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?",michael
678,"Do I know what the surprise is? Hell no! It doesn't matter. The point is, they're not unhappy anymore. They're out there thinking, 'Wow, my boss really cares about me. He has a surprise. He's cool. I... what a great guy. I love him. I...",michael
679,"OK, everyone. Gather round. Step forward. It has been brought to my attention that some of you are unhappy with my plan. So what I'd like you to do is to fill this out and write down any diseases you have that you might want covered and I'll see what I can do.",dwight
680,"OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.",jim
681,"OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.",dwight
682,Workspace.,jim
683,You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.,michael
684,Where are you going?,pam

688,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so...",michael
689,Wait. What are you writing? Don't write Ebola or mad cow disease. Right? 'Cause I'm suffering from both.,jim
690,I'm inventing new diseases.,pam
691,"Oh, great.",jim
692,"So, let's say my teeth turn to liquid and then, they drip down the back of my throat. What would you call that?",pam
693,I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.,jim
694,Nice.,pam
695,Thank you.,jim

700,So it's not a free fall?,michael
702,"Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?",michael
703,"OK, so I don't know what the surprise is. Am I worried? No. No way. See, I thrive on this. This is my world. This is improv. This is Whose Line is it Anyway?",michael
704,Damnit! Damnit Jim!,dwight
705,"All right, who did this? I'm not mad. I just want to know who did it so I can punish them.",dwight
706,What are you talking about?,jim
707,"Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.",dwight
708,"OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?",jim
709,"Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.",dwight
710,"You did this, didn't you?",dwight
711,Absolutely not.,jim
712,Yes you did.,dwight
713,No I didn't.,jim
714,"I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!",dwight
715,Killer nanorobots?,jim
716,It's an epidemic.,pam
717,"The problem, Jim, is that people who are really suffering from a medical condition won't receive the care they need, because someone in this office is coming up with all this ridiculous stuff. [reads off of paper] 'Count Choculitis'",dwight
718,Sounds tough.,jim
719,Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?,dwight
720,Do you?,jim
721,I think you need to confess...,dwight
722,Mmm hmm.,jim
723,...the fact...,dwight

780,Michael. Michael?,dwight
781,"[under his breath] Oh, Christ.",michael

902,"Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe.",michael
903,"It looks like there's gonna be downsizing. And it's part of my job, but... blah! I hate it. I think the main difference between me and Donald Trump is that, uh, I get no pleasure out of saying the words, 'You're fired.' [as Donald Trump] 'You're foir-ed. Uh, you're foir-ed.' It just makes people sad, and an office can't function that way. No way. [as Donald Trump] 'You're foir-ed.'  I think if I had a catchphrase it would be, 'You're hired, and you can work here as long as you want.' But that's unrealistic, so...",michael
904,"It's a real shame, 'cause studies have shown that more information gets passed through water-cooler gossip than through official memos. Which puts me at a disadvantage, because I bring my own water to work.",dwight

945,There's one other thing and this is important. Let's keep this alliance totally a secret. Don't tell anyone.,dwight
946,An alliance?,pam
947,Oh yeah.,jim
948,What does that even mean?,pam
949,"I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure.",jim
950,"Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.",jim
951,"Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?",dwight
952,Did you tell Pam about the alliance?,dwight
953,What? No.,jim
954,Just now.,dwight
955,"What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.",jim
956,"Right, that's good, good, pursue this.",dwight
957,Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?,jim
958,Mmm hmm.,dwight
959,"But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.",jim
960,Done.,dwight
961,All right.,jim
962,"[to the camera] Can you get her? She's right there. [camera zooms in on Meredith at here desk] That is Meredith, the birthday girl. And this... is Meredith's card. Happy Bird-Day. [laughs] Um, let's see. Jim, Jim wrote, 'Meredith, I heard you're turning 46, but, come on, you're an accountant. Just fudge the numbers.' Not bad, pretty funny, I don't appreciate condoning corporate fraud though. Uh, here's the thing. Whatever I write here has to be really, really funny. Because people out there are expecting it. I've already set the bar really high. And they're all worried about their jobs, you know. It's kinda dark out there. Can you imagine if I wrote something like, uh, 'Oh, Meredith. Happy Birthday. You're great. Love, Michael.' [pretends to vomit and laughs]",michael
963,"They seem awfully chummy, don't you think?",dwight
964,"Yeah, what do you think that's about?",jim
965,Only one way to find out.,dwight
966,I'm on it.,jim
967,You are not going to believe this.,jim
968,What? I believe it.,dwight
969,"Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.",jim
970,"I could tell, from the body language.",dwight
971,"Hey Kev, that looks good. What is it? Turkey?",jim
973,"Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone...",jim
975,"Toby and Kevin, they're trying to get Angela kicked off.",jim
976,"Good, let 'em. It helps our cause.",dwight
977,"Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking...",jim
978,"Oh, they're forming an alliance",dwight
980,I love their sandwiches too.,jim
982,Their bread is very good.,jim
983,Damn it. God!,dwight
984,"OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.",jim
985,God... Damn it! Why us?,dwight
986,"Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong.",jim
987,"[staring at birthday card] Meredith, Meredith... Meri... Mary had a little lamb. Mary... Meredith had a little lamb. Don't bring that lamb to work or it'll poop on the floor.",michael
988,"Hey, Oscar! Come on in. What's up?",michael
990,"Oh, not at all. Come on in. What's going on?",michael
992,What?,michael
994,"Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here.",michael
996,"No, I'm always good... for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you... $25.",michael
998,"Oh, my gosh, well... Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale. That's what I say, so...",michael
999,"[whispering] Hey, Jim, can I talk to you for a second?",pam
1000,"Sure, what's up?",jim
1001,"Um, I don't know, I'm just like, I'm going a little crazy 'cause I keep overhearing all these conversations between Michael and corporate about like, staff issues?",pam
1002,Oh no?,jim
1003,"Yeah, he's making me take notes on these meetings and I'm, like, 'These people are my friends.' But he's all like, 'This is confidential. You can't tell anybody.' But I just feel like I want to... aaah. Just promise me you're not gonna say anything.",pam
1004,"No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.",jim
1005,"OK, yeah.",pam
1006,Jackpot.,dwight
1007,That was beautiful. All her idea too. Awesome. She is so great.,jim
1008,"[looking at birthday card] Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath.",michael
1009,"Hey, you wanted to see me?",dwight
1010,Yeah. What do you know about Meredith?,michael
1011,I don't think she'd be missed.,dwight
1012,"There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.",michael
1013,"Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.",dwight
1014,"I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.",michael
1015,She had a hysterectomy.,dwight
1016,[laughs] Which one is that again?,michael
1017,That's where they remove the uterus.,dwight
1018,"Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?",michael
1019,It could be kind of funny.,dwight
1020,"You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just... OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time.",michael
1021,"OK, here's the deal. All right? Pam says that one of the alliances is meeting in the warehouse during Meredith's birthday.",jim
1022,"Oh my God, we have to be there.",dwight
1023,"I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there.",jim
1024,"No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God.",dwight
1025,What? What?,jim
1026,I know. I know exactly what to do.,dwight
1027,[gives Dwight a high five] Great.,jim
1028,"I'm a deer hunter. I go all the time with my dad. One thing about deer, they have very good vision. One thing about me, I am better at hiding than they are... at vision.",dwight
1029,"This is going to be perfect, OK? Centrally located. Perfect cover. I can hear and see everything.",dwight
1030,Good.,jim
1032,"Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let's go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet.",michael
1033,"Wait, this isn't gonna work. The lid's open.",jim
1034,So tape it down.,dwight
1035,I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe.,jim
1036,"Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box.",dwight
1037,"Thank you, thank you. OK.",jim
1041,"It's surprise Meredith. One, two...",michael
1043,Find a key.,michael
1045,"So do you want me to stay here and, you know, stand next to the box?",jim
1046,"No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone.",dwight
1047,Right... That's good.,jim
1048,"Can I trust Jim? I don't know. Do I have a choice? No, frankly, I don't. Will I trust Jim? Yes. Should I trust Jim? You tell me.",dwight
1050,And many more!,michael
1052,"You were surprised, weren't you?",michael
1054,"You looked freaked, man. We said 'Surprise.' You were, like, 'What?' 'What the hell's goin' on here?' Good cake. Why don't you have some?",michael
1056,Come on. A little bit.,michael
1058,"Oh, right. God, too bad. It's so good.",michael
1060,"You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself. 'Cause this is way, way too good.",michael
1061,He's in a box?,pam
1062,"Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic.",jim
1063,"[on her cell phone] Hey where are you? Yeah, we were supposed to meet here. What? Oh my gosh! That ties in perfectly with something that Michael was telling me earlier! I just don't know what some of the people in, like, accounting are going to do? It said specifically that...",pam
1064,[box falls over] Oh.,dwight
1065,"Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal.",michael
1066,"Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?",jim
1067,"Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time.",michael
1068,"Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give.",jim
1069,Is Oscar around?,michael
1070,"I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know... 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn't think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so...",michael
1072,I know...,michael
1074,Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um...,michael
1076,"No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't... No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just... it... it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape?",michael
1078,How many miles did he do last year?,michael
1080,Son of a bitch. That is impressive.,michael
1081,Happy Birthday. [gives Meredith her card],pam
1082,Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.,michael
1084,[under his breath] I don't know about that.,michael
1086,"[pretends to vomit] Huh! Thanks, downer.",michael
1088,Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old.,michael
1090,"[laughs] You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, OK, here's a good one. Um... 'Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back.' 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?",michael
1092,"Divorce. Um... OK, 'Meredith is so old...'",michael
1094,Everybody? If... could do it? 'Meredith is so old...',michael
1096,"She's so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her.'",michael
1097,"That wasn't even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, don't get mad at me.",michael
1099,"This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers?  I think we could have done better than that.",michael
1102,"OK, we... all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we're losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are... a group of people... who work together. I was... I really wasn't gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscar's nephew's... walkathon. $25.",michael
1104,"Per mile, yes.",michael
1105,"When I retire, I... don't want to just disappear to an island somewhere. I wanna be the guy who gives everything back.",michael
1106,"A check for the kids, and for the team.",michael
1107,"I want it to be like... 'Hey, who donated that hospital wing that is saving so many lives?' 'Um, well, I don't, I don't know. It was anonymous.' 'Well, guess what, [whispering] that was Michael Scott.'  'But it was anonymous, how do you know?' 'Because I'm him.'",michael
1109,"Come here. [hugs Oscar and In a low voice] Don't cash that till Friday, OK?",michael
1116,"OK, OK. I have something that totally tops the box.",jim
1117,"Oh, tell me, tell me.",pam
1118,OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... [Pam starts laughing]... spy on our other branch. No no no.,jim
1119,"But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.",jim
1120,[laughing] That's perfect!,pam
1121,If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...,jim
1123,"No, no, dude, no.",jim
1124,"Hey, Hey!",pam
1125,"No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.",jim
1126,Come on.,pam
1127,"God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um...",jim
1128,It's just office pranks.,pam
1129,"It's stupid. It's, it's just office pranks.",jim
1131,I have absolutely no idea.,dwight
1133,"Do I feel bad about betraying Jim? Not at all. That's the game. Convince him we're in an alliance, get some information, throw him to the wolves.",dwight
1134,"[With blonde hair] That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.",dwight
1201,Hey.,dwight
1202,Hey.,michael
1203,You wanted to see me?,dwight
1204,"Uh, yeah. What do you know about Meredith?",michael
1205,I don't think she'd be missed.,dwight
1206,"There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.",michael

1209,She had a hysterectomy.,dwight
1210,Which one is that again?,michael
1211,That's where they remove the uterus.,dwight
1212,"Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny here, okay. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?",michael
1213,It could be kind of funny.,dwight
1214,"[sighs] Come up with a joke that I can use, okay?",michael
1215,Mmm-hmm.,dwight
1216,Help me out here.,michael
1217,"Okay. Hey Meredith, where's your uterus?",dwight
1218,"No, not a uterus joke Dwight. Please. Something useable. A joke.",michael
1219,"If I find a joke for you, will you grant me immunity? [cut to Jim holding his hands up like a champion]",dwight
1220,What?,michael
1221,From the downsizing.,dwight
1222,"There's not going to be downsizing, Dwight. You know what, I am on a deadline here and just, okay. Thanks. Thanks for your help. I'm... I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. [Dwight leaves] Thanks for coming in, that's always... Always helpful when I give him a call. Call him in.",michael

1254,Michael!,dwight
1255,"Today at lunchtime we're going to be playing the warehouse staff at a friendly little game of basketball. My idea.  Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, 'This might be kinda fun.'  And so I started messing around and... I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans! So... you know, it's really just a good friendly game, a reason to get together.",michael
1256,"Pam, Pam, thank you ma'am. Messages, please. Thank you.",michael
1257,"Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.",dwight
1258,"No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior.",michael
1259,"Oh, please.",dwight
1260,[to camera] When I let him come to my pick-up game...,michael
1261,I apologized for that.,dwight
1262,[to Dwight] I vouched for you.,michael
1263,"Michael, I...",dwight
1264,"I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight.  All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.",michael
1265,I can handle that.,dwight
1266,"Good. Excellent, it'll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we're going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody's gonna want to do it and I know everybody's gonna complain and bitch and I don't want to have to deal with that.",michael
1267,And that's why you have an assistant regional manager.,dwight
1268,Yes it is. Assistant to  the regional manager.,michael
1269,[to camera] Same thing.,dwight
1270,"No, it's not. It's lower, so...",michael
1271,It's close.,dwight
1272,"So we need someone to work this Saturday and I think that, that should be...Jim.",dwight
1273,"God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this?",jim
1275,"My fiance has plans for us this Saturday.  So I really hope that Dwight doesn't make me work. Maybe I should sleep with him? I'm kidding, kidding. Totally kidding.",pam
1276,"All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But don't you call it that, I've earned the right.",michael
1278,"And here we have 'Mister Roger's Neighborhood.' Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He's temping upstairs.",michael
1280,And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs.,michael
1282,"No, it's Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs.",michael
1285,"[laughs] And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs.",michael
1287,"You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it's part of the job!  Rapport!",michael
1288,"[on the phone] No, no, I know that the warranty's expired, but isn't it supposed to last longer than two years if it isn't defective? OK, fine, three years.",pam
1289,"Pam gets a little down.  Her toaster oven broke. Um, which she got at her engagement shower. Um, for a wedding that still has yet to be set... and that was three years ago.",jim
1290,"So, um, one o'clock sharp and we've got a game on.",michael
1292,"Oh, I see, you're chickening out on me. You're bailing on me.",michael
1294,"Oh, well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way. [clucking and dancing like a chicken]",michael
1296,"All right, see you at one.",michael
1297,Are we ready for the game?,michael
1299,"I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.",michael
1300,Gimli.,dwight
1301,Nerd. That is why you're not on the team.,michael
1302,Just trying to be helpful.,dwight
1303,"Uh, [in a nerdy voice] 'I'll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword.'",michael
1304,That's him.,jim
1305,"OK, so, let's put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course.",michael
1307,"Um, what do you play? Center?",michael
1309,Uh...,michael
1311,"Uh, I don't know. I don't remember saying that.",michael
1312,"Uh, I heard it.",jim
1313,"Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um... other starters... Me, of course. I heard it that time.",michael
1315,"[ignores Phyllis)] Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart.",michael
1317,Yes.,michael
1319,"Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?",michael
1321,"I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box.",michael
1323,No.,michael
1325,"No, no, ridiculous.",michael

1341,Please don't throw garbage at me.,pam
1342,"Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?",michael
1343,"I don't think so Michael. Besides, I can't cheer against my fiance.",pam
1344,"I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and...",jim
1345,"Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying.",michael
1346,Maybe Angela would cheerlead.,pam
1347,"Oh, yeah right.",michael
1349,"Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you're on the team! All right, cool! Very good.",michael
1350,"Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?",michael

1692,What's that?,dwight
1693,You buy a purse.,jim
1694,I don't want a purse. Purses are for girls.,dwight

1735,"Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It's a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It's not the only drug that speeds people up.

1883,"I think in order to be a ladies man, it's imperative that people don't know you're a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. I don't know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face. [laughs] I don't know. I don't know. Maybe they're right?  I don't know.",michael

1997,"Tonight is the Dundies, the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin. [holds up a trophy of a business man] And this is everybody's favorite day. Everybody looks forward to it, because, you know, a lot of the people here don't get trophies, very often. Like Meredith or Kevin, I mean, who's gonna give Kevin an award? Dunkin' Donuts? Plus, bonus, it's really, really funny. So I, you know, an employee will go home, and he'll tell his neighbor, 'Hey, did you get an award?' And the neighbor will say, 'No man. I mean, I slave all day and nobody notices me.' Next thing you know, employee smells something terrible coming from neighbor's house. Neighbor's hanged himself due to lack of recognition.

[tears open envelope and pulls out card] 'Name three businesses that have a better health care plans than Dunder Mifflin.'  Here's the problem.

2085,"Oh, [taking it to heart] lazy. Uh huh.",michael
2086,"Excuse me, everyone, could I have your attention please. I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible.

2251,Bye.,pam
2252,"Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.",jim
2264,"The weird part about this whole deal this that Michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational. I mean, he puts more effort and time and commitment into the Dundies than anything else he does all year. Which is probably why this branch will be downsized.",jim
2289,"Angela, it's simple. Just tell me what the bathroom wall says.",dwight
2291,I'm not asking what you do in there. I just want to know what's written about Michael.,dwight

2535,What if Pam was a lesbian? What if she brought her 'partner' in to work? [to Toby] Would that be crossing the line?,michael
2537,What if they made out? In front of everybody?,michael
2539,At home? And I told everybody everything about it.,michael
2541,"Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam?",michael
2543,"I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?",michael
2544,"No, thanks. I'm good.",jim
2545,That's what she said. Pam?,michael
2546,Uh... my mother's coming.,pam
2547,"That's what she sai [clears throat]  Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself.",michael
2548,"Hey, Toby.",dwight
2550,You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.,dwight
2552,"Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like?",dwight
2555,Good. Good. And...,dwight
2557,Okay.,dwight
2572,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.",michael

2578,"So you are the lawyer, Mr. O'Malley? I know a lot of lawyer jokes.",michael
2580,"Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em.",michael
2581,"When I said before that I was king of forwards, you got to understand that I don't come up with this stuff. I just forward it along. You wouldn't arrest a guy who's just delivering drugs from one guy to another.",michael
2583,The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything.,michael
2585,"Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan.",michael
2587,"No, I've seen the video.",michael
2589,"No, I didn't. [to Jan] Huh, what? [everyone looks up at blow-up doll]",michael
2590,"Attention, everyone! Hello! Ah, yes! I just want you to know that, uh, this is not my decision, but from here on out... we can no longer be friends. And when we talk about things here we must only discuss work-associated things.  And, uh, you can consider this my retirement from comedy. And in the future, if I want to say something funny or witty or do an impression, I will no longer, ever, do any of those things.",michael
2591,Does that include 'That's What She Said'?,jim
2592,Mmmhmm. Yes.,michael
2593,"Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so...",jim
2594,THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!,michael
2596,[laughing] Come on.,michael
2599,Mwah! [kisses hand and salutes office],michael
2601,You would have done the same. You just didn't think of it first.,michael
2603,It's... That's...,michael
2605,"Okay. [to man entering office] Hello. [introduces] Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.",michael
2607,I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.,michael
2609,This guy does it all.,michael
2611,What?,michael
2613,So I'm not in trouble?,michael
2614,"I am so used to being the bad boy. I am so used to fighting Corporate that I forget that I am Corporate. Upper management. They hooked me up with an attorney. To protect me. You can't be too careful about what you say. Mo' money, mo' problems.",michael
2615,"Okay. Well, let's get you out of here, James. Um... I think we're under an hour still, so...",michael
2617,I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.,michael
2619,[ecstatic] Oh my god!,pam
2621,Hello!,pam
2622,I love my Mom. Okay. That's probably really the most obvious statement ever.,pam
2624,Yeah. I'm in charge of this whole area.,pam
2627,This is where I used to keep my computer.,pam
2629,But then I moved it.,pam
2631,"Yeah, yeah, but I uh... I switched stuff around because I actually needed like more room for organization. So...",pam
2633,"So this is like, um, an organization station...",pam
2635,Hey!,pam
2641,"Well, you know... actually, I kind of need to stall a bit. But, it's okay, because I am very used to killing time.",pam
2647,Mom!,pam
2649,No.,pam
2651,Ten minutes.,pam
2653,Then we can go to dinner.,pam
2657,"No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.",michael
2659,"Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.",michael
2661,"No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.",michael
2663,I don't know about that.,michael
2665,"Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point. [to Kevin] You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.",michael
2667,"Yes, your corner. Go.",michael
2669,Mmmhmmm.,michael
2671,"They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person. [to Phyllis] C'mere, c'mere, c'mon!  Come on! Come on.",michael
2673,Oooh!,michael
2675,I'm not worried.,michael
2677,"You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.",michael
2678,"Times have changed a little. And even though we're still a family here at Dunder-Mifflin, families grow. And at some point, the daddy can't take a bath with the kids anymore. I am Upper Management. And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam. As much as I might want to.",michael
2679,He said what?,pam
2719,"I'm an early bird, and I'm a night owl. So I'm wise, and I have worms. Oh, breakfast.",michael
2721,"Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan.",michael
2723,"Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. 'Home Alone,' 'Risky Business.' Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do.",michael
2725,"Ok. [Removes biscuit, leaving only sausage, egg and cheese.] Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.",michael
2726,"Today, I, Michael Scott, am becoming a homeowner. Investing in real estate.",michael
2727,Diversifying. Smart.,dwight
2728,"Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you.",michael
2729,"And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers.",dwight
2730,Maybe.,michael
2731,[looks bored. Taps finger on desk. Head falls to desk],jim
2732,[laughs],pam
2733,"Every so often, Jim dies of boredom. I think today it was the expense reports that did him in. And our deal is that, it's up to me to revive him.",pam
2734,You see Dwight's coffee mug?,pam
2735,Mm-hmm.,jim
2736,"Sometimes when he's not here, I try to throw stuff in it.",pam
2737,No way. Let's do this [crumples post it and throws into mug. Misses.] Oh.,jim
2738,Here.,pam
2739,Wind.,jim
2740,Try paperclips. Oh wait. This message. For Dwight.,pam

2743,Oh.,jim
2744,You should go.,dwight
2745,Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough.,michael
2746,Uh huh.,dwight
2747,Sign the papers at the condo.,michael
2748,You have your lawyer there?,dwight
2749,"Uh, I don't need one.",michael
2750,Can I be your representative?,dwight
2751,I don't need a representative.,michael
2752,I think I should be there.,dwight
2753,"No, No.",michael
2754,I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code.,dwight
2755,No. Dwight. I'm fine.,michael
2756,"Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work.",dwight
2757,"Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo, it's completely personal.",michael
2758,So you're taking a personal day?,dwight
2759,"Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.",michael
2760,"Please, I'll make you proud.",dwight
2761,"Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come.",michael
2762,Yes! As your representative?,dwight
2763,As my associate.,michael
2764,Same thing.,dwight
2765,No it is not.,michael
2766,"I have been Michael's #2 guy for about 5 years. And we make a great team. We're like one of those classic famous teams. He's like Mozart, and I'm like Mozart's friend. No. I'm like Butch Cassidy, and Michael is like Mozart. You try and hurt Mozart; you're going to get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy.",dwight
2767,"Oh, most honorable Pamera. Not offensive, because that's the way they talk in movies.",michael
2768,You headed out?,pam
2769,We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don't you have everybody work on their expense reports and I'd like them in by the end of the day.,michael
2770,Ok.,pam
2771,Very good.,michael
2772,Have a great time.,pam
2773,"We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?",michael
2774,"Yeah, I changed them to your new address.",pam
2775,Good. The Small Business Man?,michael
2776,Yup.,pam
2777,Maxim? American Way? Cracked?,michael
2778,"Yes, I changed your Cracked magazine subscription.",pam
2779,"How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?",michael
2780,[shakes head],pam
2781,"NO, well can you get on that, because I don't just read Cracked.  Thank you.",michael
2782,Yeah.,pam
2783,Ok. See you soon.,michael
2784,What kind of shocks you got on this baby?,dwight
2785,"I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?",michael
2786,[tries to open sun roof] I want to put the top down.,dwight
2787,"What? No, Dwight. It's fifty degrees outside.  Don't... please...",michael
2788,But then no one can see us.,dwight
2789,I... Just... Would you put it up? [roof opens] Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.,michael
2790,Check it out. [points at sunglasses] Terminator.,dwight
2791,I do not understand what you spend your money on.,michael
2793,"Hey, Oscar, on these new expense reports, do we really have to go back to last quarter?",jim
2795,[points at paper on desk] What does 2005 season mean?,jim
2797,"Wait a minute, what is this?",jim
2799,What?,jim
2801,Really?,jim
2804,"Oh my God!  Wait, this goes back two years.",jim
2806,[flicks football onto Kevin's desk] OH!,jim
2809,Yes!  So close.  I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game.  Yeah.,jim
2811,Why?,jim
2813,"Hey, do you guys have any other games?",jim
2817,"Home, sweet home.",michael
2818,Which one's yours?,dwight
2819,"Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait... [turns around] no, it's this one, right here. Home, sweet home.",michael
2820,[bounces ball off wall with Toby] So that's what this sound is all day.,jim

2824,Nice to meet you too.,michael
2825,This is smaller than your old place.,dwight
2826,"Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.",michael
2827,"Actually, I do own property. My grandfather left me a 60 acre working beet farm. I run it with my cousin, Mose. We sell beets to local stores and restaurants. It's a nice little farm. Sometimes teenagers use it for sex.",dwight
2829,"Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood.",dwight
2832,Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that.,michael
2833,Let's go check out the master bedroom.,dwight
2834,"Stanley. Just played Dunder Ball with Toby. What about you, you got any games?",jim
2836,Fair enough.,jim
2837,"This, my friends, is the master bedroom. Check out the cathedral ceilings. Those are like seventeen feet high. We have cable readiness. [points at wall] Right there. I am going to totally pimp this place out. I am going to put a surround sound system. I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall.",michael
2838,Oh. Terrible idea.,dwight
2839,I'm putting my bed right over here.,michael
2840,"No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed.",dwight
2841,"Well, then I will get a warrantee.",michael
2842,"Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off.",dwight
2843,Well then I won't get a warrantee.,michael
2844,Shh Shh.,dwight
2845,"So that's the problem, is solved. What?",michael
2846,Listen. [puts ear to wall] Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.,dwight
2847,[sings Olympic theme song] This scented candle ...andle ...andle. Which I found in the men's bathroom ...room ...room. Represents the eternal burning of competition. Or something.,jim
2849,"Yes it does. Yes it does my friend. Ok, we will be competing for gold, silver and bronze yogurt lids.",jim
2850,"Now the bronze are really blue, and they're also the back side of the gold, so no flipping. K? Honor system.",pam
2852,Let the games begin. [sings Olympic theme],jim
2854,What kind of mortgage did you get?,dwight
2855,Uh... Ten year.,michael
2857,What? Wha? You said ten.,michael
2859,"Ho, thirty years.",dwight
2860,"Ok, ok, ok.",michael
2861,"Wow, you'll be paying this off in your mid-seventies.",dwight
2862,Alright.,michael
2863,"Forget about retiring when you're 65. Hey, I've got an idea. You know that extra bedroom? If the whole girlfriend thing never happens, that's where the nurse can live.",dwight
2864,Ok. Alright. Oh boy.,michael
2865,"Well, this is it.",dwight
2867,"Um. Oh. [moves stove burner] Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off?",michael
2869,"Hey, look! Cool. Carpenter ants.",dwight
2870,Um. I'm going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me.,michael
2871,We'll be here waiting for you.,dwight
2872,"Oh, man.",michael
2873,"A thirty year mortgage at Michael's age essentially means that he's buying a coffin. If I were buying my coffin, I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn't hear the other dead people.",dwight
2875,"Uh. [breathes deeply, head at knees]",michael
2876,"You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies. And I'm blanking on the name, can you help me out Pam?",jim
2877,"Jim, they refer to it as Flonkerton.",pam
2878,Hum.,jim
2879,"In English, box of paper snowshoe racing.",pam
2880,"Fair enough, but I like Flonkerton.",jim
2881,"The thing about Jim, is when he's excited about something, like the Office Olympics, he gets really into it and he does a really great job. But the problem with Jim is that he works here, so that hardly ever happens.",pam
2882,"So, who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton? Anyone?",jim
2884,"Yes! Phyllis! [claps] Phyllis, just put your foot right through here [lifts strap on box of paper]. Right through the flonk.",jim
2885,"The ceilings are lower than they were last week. That, I don't... I don't...",michael
2887,...know if you showed me this same unit or not.,michael
2889,Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.,michael
2891,"As far as I can tell, I'm the best-looking person here.",michael
2892,"There's a basic principle in real estate, that you should never be the best-looking person in the development. It's just sorta common sense, because if you are, then you've no place to go but down.",michael
2894,"No, no, no.",michael
2896,I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.,michael
2898,Ehhhh....,michael
2899,I made the right decision. I'm glad I signed. I'm a homeowner. Right? Good to be a homeowner. Diversifying. This is good. This is fun. We're having fun.,michael
2900,Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today? [laughs],dwight

2913,You didn't have to...,dwight
2914,"No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.",michael
2915,"Why did I do it? Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts. Ah. I rewarded Dwight with the room, and he is rewarding me back, ah, with $500 plus utilities.",michael
2916,I don't even know what to say.,dwight
2917,"I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone.",michael

2919,What the hell is a terrarium?,michael
2920,It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards.,dwight

2935,We take separate cars.,michael
2936,Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?,dwight
2937,Why would we do that?,michael
2938,Just for fun?,dwight
2939,No.,michael
2940,Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?,dwight
2941,"EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm ... Ok.",michael
2942,"Thank god. It was nice of him to offer, but I live in a nine bedroom farm house. I have my own crossbow range. It's a perfect situation for me. Although two bathrooms would have been nice, we just have the one. And it's under the porch.",dwight
2945,Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration?,jim
2947,Ryan Howard. Ryan! [claps] Gold medal.,jim
2948,I made something for our closing ceremonies.,pam

2951,"Alright Pam, alright [gives her hi-five]. Nice work!",jim
2952,[sees Angela making check mark on tally sheet],pam
2954,You know you can always refinance your mortgage. We had a 15 year on our beet farm.  We paid it off early.,dwight
2955,"Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.",michael
2956,People love beets.,dwight
2957,Nobody likes beets.,michael
2958,Everybody loves beets.,dwight
2959,"Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet.",michael

2969,That's my stopwatch.,dwight
2970,[hands expense report to Oscar] Here you go. All done.,jim

2975,I have 59 voicemails.,pam
2976,"Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?",jim

2981,Cool.,pam
2982,Michael.,jim
2983,Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What's going... What's going on?,michael

2994,"Get up here, Dwight.",michael
2995,Silver medal.,dwight
2996,"Yep, not as good as gold. [national anthem plays] Why are you playing the national anthem?",michael

3127,Okay.,jim
3128,"Howard, slash Ryan, Ryan Howard is sitting in my office. And he has been a temp here for a couple of months and he's kind of gotten the lay of the land a little bit. Had a few laughs along the way. And now he wants to know what I think.",michael
3130,"Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent! [laughs]",michael
3131,Michael's in there right now evaluating the temp. He hasn't evaluated me in years.,dwight
3132,"Five years from now, what do you want to do? Where do you want to be?",michael
3134,Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager?,michael
3136,That is ridiculous.,michael
3137,Ryan's about to attend the Michael Scott School of Business. I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one.,michael

3542,Because it's very scary stuff.,michael
3543,I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little.,pam
3544,You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here.,michael
3545,So it's a man?,pam
3546,"No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?",michael
3547,I just answer the phone.,pam
3548,And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.,michael
3549,You're costume is fantastic! [laughs],pam

3572,"Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good?",michael
3574,"Good.  Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm  going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.",michael

3590,"Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player? [Pam laughs and types]",jim
3591,"Dwight is... special. But, I don't believe that his talents are being used in this office. So Pam and I have put his resume on Monster.com, Google, Craig's List. We're really interested most in jobs that take Dwight out of state. Um, preferably Alaska... or India.",jim

3620,"Tell him, not Dwight.",dwight
3621,That is not a very nice thing to say about him.,michael
3622,Tell him to stop.,dwight
3623,Are you kidding?,michael

3630,... What?,pam
3632,I made brownies.,pam
3634,I'm guessing Angela's the one in the neighborhood who gives the trick-or-treaters some toothbrushes. Pennies. Walnuts.,pam

3646,"If you want to fire him, you're going to have to tell him yourself.",dwight
3647,"I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just... [waves Dwight away]",michael
3648,"[whispering on the phone] Cumberland Mills?! And how did you get my resume? Oh no, no. I'm very flattered. Don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure that it's my official resume or if it's something that maybe a satisfied customer posted online. What does it say under martial arts training? Oh. Okay, I'm gonna have to supplement that. Could I have your fax number?",dwight
3649,"Would I ever leave this company? Look, I'm all about loyalty. In fact, I feel like part of what I'm getting paid for here is my loyalty. But, if there were somewhere else that valued that loyalty more highly, I'm going wherever they value loyalty the most.",dwight
3653,"[on the phone] So you got the fax? So why didn't you add it to the res... ? What do you mean? Of course martial arts training is relevant. Oh, excuse me! I know about a billion Asians that would beg to differ. Uh, yeah, I get a little frustrated when I'm dealing with incompetence. Well, you know what? You can go to hell, too. And I will see you there... burning. Fine! Okay... oh wait! So you'll let me know when you've made a decis... [stops and hangs up phone.]",dwight

3657,"Yeah, but I mean, look at the salary. And it's definitely a step up. And a challenge.",pam
3658,Yeah.  Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will. [starts walking away],jim
3659,Jim...,pam
3660,"This is called leveraging an offer. [walks into Michael's office] Michael, can I talk to you for a moment?",dwight

3662,"I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.",dwight
3663,Fantastic!,michael
3664,And I turned it down.,dwight
3665,What?! That would've solved all my problems.,michael
3666,Out of loyalty to this company...,dwight
3667,"Oh, you idiot.",michael
3668,... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.,dwight
3669,"If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody.",michael

3672,It's in Maryland.,dwight
3673,You can call. Can you call 'em?,michael
3674,I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.,dwight
3675,Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.,michael
3676,"Honestly, I don't think Michael has the slightest clue of who he's gonna  fire. I think he keeps hoping that someone's going to volunteer. Uh, or be run over by a bus before the deadline. But in the end, really, what's going to happen is it's gonna be the first person to give him a dirty look in the hall. And therein lies the true essence of his charisma.",jim
3677,[clearing his throat and interrupting Jim's talking head] Can I speak to you a minute?,michael
3678,Um... yes.,jim
3679,"Michael, I really didn't mean to...",jim
3680,Help. Me.,michael
3681,I'm sorry?,jim
3682,"I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it.",michael
3683,"Oh, you want me to be you?",jim
3684,Yes.,michael
3685,Okay.,jim
3686,"I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.",michael
3687,"Oh, are you firing Creed?",jim
3688,"No, no, no. That's just the first thing... came... in head.",michael
3689,We should switch seats in order to...,jim
3690,"Yes, that's a good idea.",michael
3691,"Alright. [they stand up] Excuse me.[They sit down] I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal...",jim
3692,Aaaahh! I'm gonna kill myself!,michael
3693,Wow.,jim
3694,"I'm going to kill myself, and it's your fault!",michael
3695,That's an overreaction.,jim
3696,Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month.,michael
3697,"Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you...",jim
3698,I... this is Creed.,michael
3699,Okay.,jim
3700,"I'm improvising, so just try to keep up. [phone rings]",michael
3701,"Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought.",jim
3702,"And I'm very angry, and I want...",michael
3703,[picks up the phone] Michael Scott here.,jim
3704,I'm gonna kill you. I'm going to kill you for firing me.,michael
3705,"Toby? Mm hmm. [looks back to Michael] I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth...",jim
3706,"Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off.[sits back down in his chair and waves Jim off.] Just, just... yeah.",michael
3707,What happened?,pam
3708,It wasn't me.,jim
3709,Oh. That was like crazy. 'Cause I was...,pam
3710,"Yeah, I know.",jim
3711,"Uh, hey... Creed?",michael
3713,Could I talk to you for a second?,michael
3714,"You are great. Very ambitious. And I feel like you want more than this little office has to offer. And I understand that you'd wanna just spread your wings, and fly the coop.",michael
3716,I... we're gonna have to... You... you want something better.,michael
3718,"No, you wanna leave.",michael
3720,Why... why are you making this so hard?,michael
3722,I think you're right.,michael
3724,"No, of course  you can't go. We haven't even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're... you're, goodbye.",michael
3726,Hmm?,michael
3728,What old days? What are you talking about?,michael
3730,"It's right here on the desk, yeah.",michael
3732,"I can't, I can't...",michael
3734,I can't change anything. This is the way...,michael
3736,"I don't... okay, just listen.",michael
3738,Don't...,michael
3739,"Yeah, I went hunting once. Shot the deer in the leg, had to kill it with a shovel. Took about an hour. Why do you ask?",michael
3740,"I have to fire someone today, okay?",michael
3742,"Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you.",michael
3744,Don't...,michael
3746,"Devon, could I talk to you for a sec?",michael
3748,"Well, he...",michael
3750,"Well, maybe I did.",michael
3752,"Huh. No! I can't, no. I can't go back. I would look like an idiot.",michael
3754,No.,michael
3756,"No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and...",michael
3758,I just hope that you and I can remain friends.,michael
3759,"Devon, wait, please.",michael
3761,"Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili's. From me. Okay? No hard feelings.",michael
3764,"Oh, hey, Jim. Wait, stop. Um, I'm sorry... for pushing you towards Cumberland. Seriously, if you left here, I would blow my brains out.",pam
3765,[motions for her to follow him] Come on.,jim
3766,"That's just a figure of speech, you know? Blow your brains out? Come on. All it really means is that we're friends. Who else is she gonna talk to if I'm gone, right? I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.",jim
3767,"I  love Halloween. You know, it's just, it's just fun. Every year, it's just fun. Last Halloween I came as Janet Jackson's boob. It was topical. People got a... a big kick out of it. The year before that, I came as Monica Lewinsky, and I wore a stained dress. The year before that, I also came as Monica Lewinsky. And before that, I was O.J. It was pretty funny. Oh, I wish you were here last year.",michael
3769,"He... Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great.",michael
3771,You look great! And you're a princess?,michael
3773,A fairy princess. You're very... .,michael
3775,"You're a lion. [trying to to open a bag of candy] Wow, I want to hear your, your... Oh! [the bag tears open, spilling all the candy] Oh, okay, that's all yours. That's all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these.",michael
3801,"I will handle it in the best way possible, but in case he or she goes postal, you will be available to subdue. Am I correct?",michael
3803,"I don't know. Hey, are you on our payroll or are you employed by the building?",michael
3805,"Oh, shoot. Okay, well, just have your pepper spray ready.",michael
3807,"All right. All right, this is it. By the time I get back to our floor, I will have decided. [elevator bell dings] Wow, that's  a fast elevator.",michael
3862,Where is my desk?,dwight
3863,That is weird.,jim
3864,This is not funny.  This is totally unprofessional.,dwight
3865,"Ok, well, you're the one who lost the desk.",jim
3866,I didn't lose my desk.,dwight
3867,"Okay, calm down.  Where was the last place you saw it?",jim
3868,"Okay, who moved my desk?",dwight
3869,I think you should retrace your steps.,jim
3870,"Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished!",dwight
3871,"Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot,  hot, very hot.",jim
3872,"[In bathroom, answers phone] Dwight Schrute.",dwight
3873,"[On the phone with Dwight] Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.",jim
3874,"Jim, I've given you this information, like, twenty times.",dwight
3875,I know.,jim
3876,It's by the ream?,dwight
3877,"Uh, yeah, ream.",jim
3878,"...now, $9.78, signs and discounts 7%.",dwight
3879,"Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.",jim
3880,"Wash your hands, Kevin.",dwight
3881,"[On the phone] Right, oh let me just check the pricing list.  Hold on one second...",jim
3882,"[Also on the phone] Sensei, hello it's Sempai...",dwight
3883,Umm...,jim
3884,Dwight...,dwight
3885,"You know what, let me give you a call right back. I'm going to uh, find it and then I'll call you back, thanks.",jim
3886,"Yes, I just had a ques-... Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai.",dwight
3887,Was that your mom?,jim
3888,"No, that was my Sensei.",dwight
3889,"Oh, I thought it was your mom.",jim
3890,"I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei.",dwight
3891,"Assistant to the Sensei, that's pretty cool.",jim
3892,Assistant Sensei.,dwight
3893,Ok.,jim
3894,"I am a practitioner of Goju Ru Karate, here in Scranton. My Sensei, Ira, recently promoted me to purple belt, and gave me the duties of a Sempai. Not that a lot of people here in America know what a Sempai is, but it is equally as respected as a Sensei.",dwight
3896,I don't really have any control over that Stanley.,pam
3897,"Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work. Umm, time cards, he has to sign these every Friday. Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month. And expense reports, all he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter. But once a year, it all falls on the same Friday and that's today. I call it the Perfect Storm.",pam
3898,"[singing and tapping on his coffee mug] I don't want to work, I just want to bang on this mug all day.",michael
3900,"Uhh, yes, I did, here's the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information.",michael
3902,"[to Pam] Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin.",michael
3903,"Umm, I put stickers so you know where to sign.",pam
3904,"Yes, thank you. I know where to sign.",michael
3905,It's just last year you...,pam
3906,"Last year they were out of order, weren't they Pam?",michael
3907,"Well, the last pick-up for overnight deliveries is at seven. So you need to have them signed by then. Or much earlier.",pam
3908,"Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That's pretty good. Um, actually, I'm sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.",michael
3910,"Well, is that really a priority?",pam
3911,"Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. 'Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority.' Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That's the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you.",michael
3913,"Catch-22. Yes. Why don't you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what's your cell?",michael
3914,"Uh, Larissa Halpert.",jim
3916,117 Mount Bergin St.,jim
3918,"[in his office on his cell phone, talking in a fake high voice] Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland.",michael
3920,This is Tito.,michael
3922,Calling from... [Ryan hangs up],michael
3923,[Reading Jim's palm] You're major and minor lines cross at a ridge - that sucks.,pam

3925,I am just following the website.,pam

3927,"Yes, you have very nice teeth.",pam
3928,Thanks.,jim
3932,[Taps on the glass in his office to get Ryan's attention] Pick up.,michael
3934,[in a high pitched voice] This is Mike Tyson.,michael
3935,"Hey, Dwight. As Sempai, do you think there is ever going to be a day where humans and robots can peacefully co-exist?",jim
3936,Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me.,dwight
3937,No I'm not.,jim
3938,"Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you.",dwight
3939,"Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is this: umm, don't ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it. [reveals Dwight's purple belt]",jim
3940,"Ok, give that back to me.",dwight
3941,"Ok, say please.",jim
3942,No. That is not a toy.,dwight
3943,Please?,jim
3944,Please?,dwight
3945,"Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou.",jim
3946,Arigatou. This is not a toy. This is a message to the entire office so they can see that I am capable of physically dominating them.,dwight
3947,"And this is more a ying-yang thing. The 'Michael' all cursive, the 'Scott' all caps. Left brain, right brain. Or, duality of man.",michael
3948,Could you practice on the forms?,pam
3949,"No women or children, unless provoked.",dwight
3950,"Ok, Roy?",jim
3951,Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.,dwight
3952,Ok. Michael? Could you beat up Michael?,jim
3953,"Yeah, yeah, I don't think that would happen.",michael
3954,Because we're friends.,dwight
3955,Because I would kick his ass.,michael
3956,"Well, Dwight's a purple belt, so...",jim
3957,So? I've beaten up black belts.,michael
3958,"Uh, how did you know they were black belts?",jim
3959,"They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out.",michael
3964,"And after that, nobody ever messed with the 'Damn Rascals' ever again.",michael
3965,"Sounds tough. When you're a Jet, [starts snapping] you're a Jet all the way, right?",jim
3966,You were a Jet?,michael
3968,"Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me. [Puts Dwight in a headlock] Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link.",michael
3969,Argggg!,dwight
3970,"I'm friends with everybody in this office. We're all best friends - I love everybody here. But sometimes your best friends start coming into work late, and start having dentist appointments that aren't dentist appointments. And that's when it is nice to let them know that you can beat them up.",michael
3971,Just hit me. You'll see.,michael
3972,I can't. I just got a manicure.,jim
3973,"Oh, queer... [realizes he is on camera] eye. Queer eye. That's a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it.",michael
3974,Just have Dwight punch you.,jim
3975,"Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass.",michael
3976,You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?,jim
3977,What belt are they?,dwight
3978,"Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'...",michael
3979,No!,dwight
3980,... he cried at the end of it. He did.,michael
3981,"Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight.",dwight
3982,"Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?",michael
3983,"Ok, I'll punch you.",dwight
3984,"Ok, here we go. Alright, come on.",michael
3985,Kiyah!,dwight
3986,Fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh!,michael
3987,"Did I want to harm Michael? The one man I've been hired to protect? No, I did not.",dwight
3988,Are you ok? Are you sure you are alright?,jim
3989,Yeah. [Jim opens office door for Michael] Thank you.,michael
3990,I come from a long line of fighters. My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew. World War II veteran. Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an Allied Prison Camp. My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life. Different kind of fight.,dwight
3991,"Ok, he has to be stopped. Please, please, please, please, just ask Michael.",jim
3992,I don't know.,pam
3993,"Ok, I'll buy you a bag of chips.",jim
3994,French Onion?,pam
3995,Obviously.,jim
3996,Ok.,pam
3997,Yes.,jim
3998,"[to Kevin, who he is teaching to fight] Take this pen and stab me with it.",dwight
3999,[Pam knocks on his door] Go away.,michael
4000,I just have a quick question.,pam
4001,"I haven't signed them, ok?",michael
4002,"No, it's not that. Um, I was just wondering, since I'm probably going to have to stay late, could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car?",pam
4003,"Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough.",michael
4004,He's a purple belt. That's really high.,pam
4005,"Oh, I could beat up Dwight. That's ridiculous. I could murder him.",michael
4006,"It's just out there, you...",pam
4007,"Oh, so that's what they are saying?",michael
4008,Yeah.,pam
4009,"Ok, alright, where is Dwight?",michael
4010,"Uh, Kitchen.",jim
4011,Ok.,michael
4013,Good.,dwight
4015,"Now watch, let me take you from behind.",dwight
4017,"Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you.",michael
4018,"I didn't sucker punch you, Michael.",dwight
4019,"No, Really?",michael
4020,"In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai.",dwight
4021,"Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22.",michael
4022,"Ok, fine. Tit for tit. Give it your best shot. Two punches. Go!",dwight
4023,"Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches: me punching you and you hitting the floor.",michael
4024,"No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.",dwight
4025,Really?,michael
4026,Yeah.,dwight
4027,You know what? You're just lucky that we are at work right now.,michael
4028,"Ooh, what about, uh,  Dwight's dojo?",jim
4029,"No, they must have class.",michael
4030,"No, it's free during the day. It's fine.",dwight
4031,Look...,michael
4032,I've got the key.,dwight
4034,"Hey, Toby.",michael
4036,"I've got an idea: why don't you leave right now. Why don't you walk away from the room, 'kay? Fine. We'll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools.",michael
4037,"Um, well, we are all getting excited to see this fight. The Albany branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing, but Michael, he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight. Fight... Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, I'm coming, fight...",jim
4038,I recognize that. That is Japanese for California Roll.,michael
4040,I think it is. A guy told me about that.,michael
4042,Oh.,michael
4043,"[Reading Pam's palm, while she has on extremely padded gloves] Wow, that is really interesting.",jim
4044,What?,pam
4045,Your love line- I'm just kidding. I can't see anything.,jim
4046,"Well, look closer.",pam
4047,"[Jim moves his head closer and Pam taps him gently in the face] Oh, ok.",jim
4048,Once point for me.,pam
4049,[Gently taps Pam on the forehead] Tied up.,jim
4050,"Oh, you're dead.",pam
4051,"What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now.",jim
4052,"Hey, put me down. Put me down. [Meredith turns and looks at Jim and Pam] Oh my god, hey, put me down. Hey...",pam
4054,"Yes, Sensei!",dwight
4055,"Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn't have any rules. Maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner.",michael

4061,Yes!,dwight

4072,It was my pants.,dwight
4074,"Dwight, you have... No, you have something... God, you look like such an idiot! [Lots of yelling and flailing of arms by Michael and Dwight]",michael

4078,No holding.,dwight
4079,"You can't see. You can't see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win. [Michael is using his head guard to hit Dwight] Eight points. Nine points. [Begins to hock a loogie]",michael
4080,"No, stop it! Come on! Michael.",dwight

Come here. [Michael opens his blinds and looks at Ryan in the parking lot] There he is. Mr. Temp. Having lunch by the car. Let us play with him. This'll be hilarious. [Calls Ryan on the phone, Ryan doesn't pick up after seeing that Michael is calling] Oh, we're playing phone tag.",michael
4085,My emergency contact is Todd Packer. Todd F. Packer. Do you know what the F. stands for?,michael
4087,"[knock at the door] Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya?",michael
4088,I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott.,dwight
4090,Just put 'The Hospital.' Contact number: just put 9-1-1. [Dwight leaves],dwight
4091,"He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man.",michael

4094,"Yeah, you too.",pam
4095,[Knock at the door] Yeah.,michael
4097,"Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I'll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend?",michael
4099,"If you're doing anything crazy, give me a shout.",michael
4101,"Alright, bye.",michael
4102,Dwight?,michael
4104,"This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?",michael
4105,I'm busy.,dwight
4106,"Well, [points at himself] busier. Making the time.",michael
4109,"Well, you don't even have anyone to go home to, Toby.",michael
4110,The shipping place closes in a half hour.,pam
4111,"I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's gangbang this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.",michael
4114,I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that?,michael
4115,Of course.,dwight
4116,And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.,michael
4117,"Michael, I don't know...",dwight
4118,"I know, I know, I know, I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it.",michael
4119,I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.,dwight
4120,"No, no, title change only.",michael
4121,I'll have Pam send out a memo.,dwight
4122,"No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now.",michael
4123,Just a formality.,dwight
4124,Absolutely but not really.,michael
4125,"Michael, I have so much to learn from you.",dwight
4126,Yes you do.,michael
4127,"Thank you, Sensei.",dwight
4128,"And, ditto.",michael
4129,"I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo.",michael
4131,"[Dwight's pager goes off] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Hold on. Sorry, just one second.",dwight
4133,"Okay, I just...",dwight
4135,It's a sales call.,dwight
4137,"I can... Yes, sensei.",dwight
4138,"Do I feel bad that I haven't bonded with the other students? No, I'm not there to make friends. I'm there to attack people.",dwight
4172,Alyssa? I guess she's technically the senpai. But nobody really respects her. The only reason she got into regionals was because her competition was a bunch of 13-year-old girls. Put me in that division. Let's see how she does.,dwight
4173,"God, you look like such an idiot. [both yelling] [grunting]",michael
4192,No.  They're in the conference room.,jim

I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here.  Not more.  The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not. [another Jan stare]  Hey, everybody, listen up.

The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager.  Just, uh, she didn't want it to continue for some reason.  It, we both, I didn't want it, we both didn't want it to continue.  Was not professional.  Um, when people say something's mutual, it never is.  But this was mutual.",michael

Number one: 'What should we do to prepare for Y2K?'",michael
4652,What should we do to prepare for Y2K?,dwight
4654,"Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box. [to Jan] That happens occasionally.",michael
4655,It happens occasionally.,dwight
4656,"And, um, one down.  Next suggestion: 'we need better outreach for employees fighting depression'.  Ok, alright, enough with the jokes.  Nobody in here is suffering from depression.",michael
4658,"Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?",michael
4659,Tom?,dwight
4660,Tom.  Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.,michael
4662,"Oh, that guy?  That guy was weird.  Alright, next suggestion.",michael
4663,Next suggestion.,dwight
4664,"Arrr, dooby dooby do. 'You need to do something about your B.O.'",michael
4665,You need to do something about your B.O.,dwight
4666,"Ok, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion.  Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.",michael
4668,"Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words.",michael
4670,"Was I, Creed?!  Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank.  Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of.  Ok?  Now that we've learned this, let's continue.  See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out.  'You need to do something about your coffee breath'-",michael
4671,You need-,dwight
4672,Ok.,michael
4673,To do something about-,dwight
4674,"Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.",michael
4676,"Yeah, is that hard for you?  Alright, well-",michael
4678,I'll work on that-,michael
4680,"Let's keep going.  Keep it going.  Yep.  What do we have here?  We have somebody's piece of gum.  Somebody put a piece of gum in there.  This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company.  This is not a place for gum.  I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow.",michael

The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah!  Yes!  Why are you gonna give me this raise?  Why?  Because... I'm awesome! I am awesome!,dwight
4697,I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.,michael
4699,Look-,michael
4700,Michael?,dwight
4701,Oh my God...,michael

4704,Great.,dwight
4705,What do you want Dwight?,michael
4706,I am ready for my performance review.,dwight
4707,"Ok, great.  Your performance has been adequate.  You may leave; goodbye.",michael
4709,"You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave.",michael
4710,"Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?",dwight
4711,Why on earth would we give you a raise?,michael
4712,"That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking.  Let me bring up one word: dedication. [points to graphs] I have never been late.  Also, I have never missed a day due to illness. [Michael sighs] Even when I had walking pneumonia.  I even come in on holidays.",dwight
4713,You do?  How do you get in?,michael
4714,I have a copy of your key.,dwight
4716,That is a serious offense. Very serious.  As is toying with a man's heart.,michael
4718,I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.,dwight
4719,"Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that?",michael
4720,"For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.",dwight
4721,"That was deer!? Gross, oh!",michael
4722,You liked it!,dwight
4723,"Oh, did not!",michael
4724,"Jan, have you ever had deer?",dwight
4726,"It's a delicacy.  And you know what?  It's an aphrodisiac.  So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.",dwight
4727,"What do you say, Jan?",michael
4729,"Ok. You just, uh, clear your head.",michael
4732,"And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said 'Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of'.",dwight
4733,That's from Superman?,michael
4734,"Smallville.  And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.",dwight
4735,Do you think Michael and Jan actually...,pam
4736,"I don't really wanna picture it.  But thank you, Pam.",jim
4737,How do you come back from that?,pam
4738,"Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together.",jim
4739,"No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?",pam
4740,Oh-,jim
4741,As a human being.,pam
4742,"Yeah, no, I don't think you can.",jim
4744,Wait.,michael
4746,"Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?",michael
4748,"Ok, so you're saying that there is a different time or place?",michael
4750,"Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance?",michael
4752,"I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio?",michael
4754,Am I too short?,michael
4756,Really?,michael
4758,"I appreciate that, thank you.",michael
4760,"No, I wasn't, I didn't cry-",michael
4762,So my looks have nothing to do with it?,michael
4764,Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now.  And it doesn't matter how great a guy I am.  And that is all I needed; I'm good.  I can go home now.,michael
4765,"Hey, it's 12:20; where the hell's Dwight?",michael
4766,Ummm... no idea.,jim

4772,So...,michael
4774,"Um, you're in accounting...",michael
4776,"So, good, good, good. Something to work toward, being here more. I'm a big believer in people being here more.",michael
4796,"I am not going to discuss anything outside of Dunder Mifflin business, period.' Okay. Now, why would Jan say she only wants to talk business and then make it clear that she is on her period? God, I don't understand women. How about a clear signal, right? Is that too much to ask?",michael
4876,"Hello, is this R. Gould? Hi there. My name is Michael Scott, I work at Dunder Mifflin. I believe I work with your wife, ex-wife, Jan. Yeah, that's right, yes. Um... I was wondering if I could ask a personal question about her. Mmm-hmm. Okay, well, could I ask anyway? Uh-huh. Well, I'm just gonna ask. When you guys were dating was she sort of easy to get and then really hard to get?",michael
4877,"Yeah, that Gould is a real interesting guy, a gem. I can see why he and Jan are no longer together. If my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship, he was verbally abusive, he was curt. He was... He had an inability to communicate, shall I say? He was emotionally unavailable. I don't know how she dealt with that as long as she did.",michael
4897,"What is an office? Is it a group of people? Maybe. Is it an idea? Of course, yes. Is it a living organism? Exactly, yes. And any single cell organism has to have a spine, and that's me. But the spine is always controlled by a brain, and that is Jan. But the brain needs a heart, and that is me again. So ironic. You know what? The heart is smarter than the brain. But the brain is so effing hot.",michael

4915,I can't tell you.,michael
4916,You have to tell me.,dwight
4917,I don't have to tell you anything.,michael
4918,"Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.",dwight
4919,"Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok?  I'm in the best shape of my life.  Look at this. [flexes his arms] Brrr!  That's strong!",michael
4920,"Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-",dwight
4921,I'm not going get a brain-,michael
4922,Or get hit by a car-,dwight

4939,You know what the problem is?,michael
4941,"The problem is that when people hear the term 'big brother', they immediately think it's scary or bad, but I don't. I think, wow, I love my big brother.",michael

4980,Yeah!  They were the most fun.  We always invited them.,michael
4981,"It's true. I'm having a party.  I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael.  So three ingredients for a great party.  And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody.  Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up.  [sighs]  He is very real.",jim

Hold me closer and I feel no pain.  In every beat of my heart, we got something goin' on.  Tender love is blind---",michael
5167,We're making love!,michael
5169,Talk! Just talk!,michael
5171,Shut up!,michael
5172,"Funny story: the way that I got into improv was, I got into improv.  The story about me getting into improv was that I was walking down the street, and a race car pulls up, and the guy says 'Hey you're funny, you're the funniest guy I've ever seen, or my name is not Dale Earnhardt.' [giggles]  And that was an improv.  Um, the real way is that I found a flyer.",michael
5306,Go. Get the door.,dwight
5307,Here we are.,michael
5308,Go. Push!,dwight
5309,Oh god.,michael
5310,Push!,dwight
5311,"No, no, turn it around.",michael
5312,Really shove it.,dwight
5313,You'll break it.,michael
5314,Shove it through! Break it!,dwight
5315,"You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Don't break the branches, Dwight.",michael
5316,All right.,michael
5317,I got a splinter.,dwight
5318,"Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have! [laughs] Nice, huh?",michael
5319,I've got it leveraged. Push. Straight up.,dwight
5320,"On three. Ready? Big, one, two, three.",michael
5321,"One, two, three. [they push the tree up and it breaks through a ceiling tile.]",dwight
5322,Merry Christmas!,michael
5323,Did it work?,michael
5325,"A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.",michael
5327,"Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about.",michael
5328,"So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. [holds up a miniature pencil] This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.",jim
5333,"[comes into the conference room in a Santa hat and beard]  Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, [points to Ryan] pimp. I'm kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting?",michael
5335,Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.,michael
5336,"It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G's. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that.",michael
5337,"I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And I'll be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive.",michael
5338,You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party.,pam
5339,"Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody.",michael
5341,You guys should use a hand truck.,dwight
5343,No.,dwight
5345,No! No way! It... no.,michael
5347,You wanna be Santa?,michael
5349,Have you ever seen Santa?,michael
5351,Okay.,michael
5353,"Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work.",michael
5354,"Michael, I would like to be the elf.",dwight
5355,That makes sense because he has elfish features.,michael
5356,"[now wearing an elf hat and ears] Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael.",dwight
5360,You get something good this year?,michael
5361,I think I did a pretty good job.,jim
5362,Yeah? Who did you have?,michael
5363,"Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret.",jim
5364,I think I got something pretty nice for my guy.,michael
5365,Yeah?,jim
5366,I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow.,michael
5367,"Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?",jim
5368,Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.,michael
5369,"That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can ..",jim
5370,It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan.,michael
5371,"Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons.",dwight
5373,I want to do it.,dwight
5374,"All right, let's count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready?",michael
5376,Not great.,michael
5378,I think the tree looks nice.,pam
5379,"Hey, I could get some flares from my car.",dwight
5380,"No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let's do Secret Santa.",michael
5381,"Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, 'Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth.'",michael
5382,"First present, Oscar.",dwight
5386,Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim.,dwight
5387,"Oh, cool. [opens his plastic bag]",jim
5389,Great. Where did you get it?,jim
5391,"He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag.",jim
5393,Pam.,dwight
5394,"[opens up her present] Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome.",pam
5395,There's a little more to it.,jim
5396,"All right, next. Ryan. [tosses present]",dwight
5397,"No, don't!",michael
5399,"Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.",michael
5401,You don't know that.,michael
5403,I did?,michael
5405,"What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?",michael
5406,Michael.,dwight
5407,"Oh hey, for me. What is in here? [opens a handmade oven mitt] Oh, come on.",michael
5409,An oven mitt? Okay. [walks out],michael
5410,"So Phyllis is basically saying, 'Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth.' I gave Ryan an iPod.",michael
5412,We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.,dwight
5413,I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.,michael
5414,What is Yankee Swap?,jim
5415,"One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift.",michael
5416,I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.,jim
5417,"Yeah, we call it White Elephant.",pam
5418,"Well, I call it fun!",michael
5420,Because it's better. Because it's more special.,michael
5422,"Shut it. No, it's not. Okay, just give it a shot.",michael
5424,"Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt.",michael
5426,"Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.",jim
5427,"Yankee Swap! That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.",michael
5428,I'll take the iPod.,pam
5430,"Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.",dwight
5433,I think this is going great.,michael
5437,"Angela, you're up.",dwight
5440,Everyone wants the iPod. It's a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.,michael
5441,"Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn.",michael
5444,"Okay, moving along. Meredith, let's go.",dwight
5446,It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else.,dwight
5447,"[holding oven mitt] I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It's beautiful.",michael
5449,"Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology.",michael
5450,"Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.",michael
5451,"[opens present] 'In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute.'",michael
5452,"You and me, Michael. Yes!",dwight
5453,Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?,michael
5454,I never said it was better than an iPod.,dwight
5455,"Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.",dwight
5456,"[shooting paintball gun at target] Take that, Saddam!",dwight
5457,Last gift. Kevin.,michael
5460,"Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.",dwight
5461,I want the iPod.,pam
5463,Sure you don't want the teapot?,jim
5464,"Well, I mean, it's an iPod. But ..",pam
5465,Right.,jim
5466,"Sorry, I ..",pam
5467,No. No. Definitely. It's ..,jim
5469,Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.,dwight
5470,Got to be kidding me.,jim
5471,Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.,dwight
5472,[after Phyllis leaves suddenly] What is she so upset about?,michael
5473,Maybe because you hated her present so much.,pam
5474,Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets.,michael
5475,"Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.",jim
5477,"Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!",michael
5479,How much?,pam
5480,"It wasn't. It wasn't that much. It was $3,000.",michael
5482,"Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party's so lame.",michael
5484,"All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?",michael
5486,"Cool, cool. Box it up.",michael
5487,"I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?",jim
5488,No trades.,dwight
5489,"Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.",jim
5490,A real man makes his own luck.' Billy Zane.,dwight
5491,"Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?",jim
5492,No. I want it. I'm going to use it.,dwight
5493,You don't even drink tea.,jim
5494,"True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems ..",dwight
5495,Okay ..,jim
5496,".. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. [demonstrates]",dwight
5497,"To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle.",jim
5499,I know. It's totally going to change the way I work out.,pam
5501,So what are you going to get me instead?,pam
5503,Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty.,michael
5505,"This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.",michael
5508,"Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?",michael
5510,"Go, here we go!",michael
5532,"Anybody making out in here? [checks hallway] Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink. [takes picture of Jim] Okay, how's it going in here? [takes picture of Meredith and Kevin]",michael
5535,"No, no, no, no. We'll find some, don't leave the party.",michael
5537,"Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee.",michael
5539,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",michael
5541,"Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend.",michael
5542,"You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.",jim
5543,"[laughs] No, I was just checking out my present. [holds up teapot]",pam
5544,But ..,jim
5545,"I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so ..",pam
5546,"Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.",jim
5547,[opens teapot] Oh my god! The yearbook picture!,pam
5548,"Yeah, I think I made the right choice.",pam
5549,"Oh, my God! It's incredible. [Jim reaches and steals his card back before she can notice it] Is this the Boggle timer?",pam
5550,I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't.,jim
5551,This is so awesome.,dwight
5552,"Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to.",michael
5553,Thank you.,dwight
5554,You're welcome.,michael
5556,"No way. Oh, you're kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen!",michael
5558,"Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake.",michael
5560,"Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up.",michael
5562,Darryl. There you go. [hands him the Santa hat] You earned it.,michael
5564,"No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it.",michael
5566,"Hey, Merry Christmas.",michael
5570,[coming out of his office] Lampshade on head! It's happening!,michael
5573,"Oh, hello there. [Kelly leans up and kisses him] But what are you doing?",dwight
5575,You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.,dwight
5580,Yes.,dwight
5582,"Yeah, that sounds good.",michael
5583,"Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What's better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It's really the greatest day of all time.",michael
5584,"Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard's?",michael
5586,"Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride? [Meredith drops her top. Michael takes a picture] All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?",michael
5588,Okay!,michael
5597,Phyllis and Angela and Meredith are helpers. I guess Angela's kind of... Angela's little. Phyllis and Meredith are not little. Pam is sort of a medium helper.,michael
5599,"Dwight is... Dwight looks like Spock to me. He always wears the ears, and I always give him grief about looking like Spock, and he hates it because he has a different pair of ears that he wears to be Spock, for some reason.",michael
5611,"What separates humans from jungle beasts? The fact that we have rules. When humans give each other gifts, they do it properly and orderly. When bears give each other gifts they just rip open a fox carcass and present it to their mate. I prefer the human way.",dwight
5648,"See, that's what Christmas is all about to me, is when you see someone open a gift and you think, 'Man, I wish I got that.' I mean, that's just such a great feeling, to watch other people envying a gift that you gave to somebody else. I don't know, it's just... I don't know, just makes you kind of feel good.",michael
5649,Hey.,jim
5650,Hello. Jim?,dwight
5651,"What's up, buddy?",jim
5652,This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?,dwight
5653,"Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.",jim
5654,"Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy.",dwight
5655,"Who, Steve?",jim
5656,"Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is.",dwight
5657,"Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup.",pam
5658,"No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup.",dwight
5659,"Um, I don't think so, I just bought it.",pam
5660,"Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me.",dwight
5661,I love these.,pam
5662,"Okay, fine. Where's my wallet?",dwight
5663,"Oh, there it is. J1.",jim
5664,But I don't have any...,dwight
5665,"Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.",jim
5666,"[putting quarters in] Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five...",dwight
5667,"Hello, everyone.",michael
5668,"Good morning, Michael.",dwight
5670,Ah! Ha ha ha!,michael
5671,"Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo.",pam
5672,"It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask.'",jim
5673,A ski mask and a swimsuit.,pam
5674,"So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.",jim
5675,And brush our teeth.,pam
5676,Yeah?,michael
5678,Stanley! Bo banley.,michael
5680,Banana fana fo fanley.,michael
5682,Be my mo manley.,michael
5684,Stanley.,michael
5686,"Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it?",michael
5688,"Maybe, I don't know.",michael
5690,"Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.",michael
5692,It's cheaper.,michael
5693,This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.,michael
5694,It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It's a booze cruise!,michael
5697,"No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.",michael
5699,"Well, this...",michael
5701,Yeah?,michael
5703,To throw you off the scent.,michael
5705,"Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.",michael
5707,"Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, 'Who is this smart little cookie?' Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.",michael
5708,"I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.",michael
5709,"Leader... ship. The word 'ship' is hidden inside the word 'leadership,' as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork!",michael
5711,"Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?",michael
5713,"Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.",michael
5715,"Yeesh, how old is this ship?",jim
5716,How about the anchor?,pam
5718,"All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!",michael
5719,I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?,jim
5720,Titanic?,michael
5721,I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October.,pam
5722,"No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on!",michael
5723,"Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.",jim
5725,"No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse.",michael
5727,"The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.",michael
5728,"Aye aye, Captain.",dwight
5729,"[singing] A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.",michael
5730,"Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey. [to Kelly] Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring... [to Stanley] We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan.",michael
5731,Cool.,dwight
5733,"I'd rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party.",michael
5735,Okay.,michael
5736,"In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulose.",michael
5737,"Hey, look! I'm king of the world!",michael
5739,"And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!",michael
5741,Okay! So...,michael
5743,Right.,michael
5745,"But don't worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight.",michael
5747,I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna...,michael
5749,Rock it!,michael
5751,"If the boat's a-rockin', don't come knockin'!",michael
5753,Yep.,michael
5755,We're all gonna have a good time tonight!,michael
5757,Hm? Okay. Yep.,michael
5763,"It's not hilarious, but...",jim
5767,"Um, no.",jim
5770,Having fun?,michael
5772,"Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.",michael
5774,"Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so... right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support.",michael
5776,"So, okay.",michael
5777,"Limbo, whoo!",dwight
5781,"Me! Me, me, me.",dwight
5783,I'm stronger.,dwight
5786,"I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.",dwight
5788,"But before that, I have to do my presentation.",michael
5790,"All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!",michael
5791,Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.,michael

5797,"No, I'm not going to do that.",pam
5800,"Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out?",pam
5802,It's getting kind of rowdy down there.,pam
5803,Yeah. [chanting] Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!,jim
5804,Sometimes I just don't get Roy.,pam
5805,Well...,jim
5806,"I mean, I don't know. So... what's it like dating a cheerleader?",pam
5807,"Oh, um... [A long silence.]",jim
5808,I'm cold.,pam
5810,"Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?",michael
5812,"No, no. Salesmen and profit centers.",michael
5814,"Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership.",michael
5816,Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.,dwight
5817,Okay.,michael
5818,"Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour.",dwight
5820,"Uh, I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So... you don't wanna ask my advice.",pam
5822,"Um... let's see, uh...  The customer. Because the customer is king.",jim
5823,"Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.",michael
5827,You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.,jim
5829,"I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?",michael
5831,"Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing.  Congratulations. That is great!",michael
5833,Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!,michael
5834,"No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there.",pam
5835,Then I'll give you away!,michael
5836,"No, thank you.",pam
5838,No.,jim
5840,I don't know. Let's break up.,jim
5844,Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.,dwight
5845,Captain Jack is a fart face. I'm on medication.,michael
5847,"Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a...",michael
5849,"It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about.",michael
5850,"I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.",michael
5851,Is somebody there?,michael
5852,What happened to you?,jim
5853,Captain Jack has a problem with authority.,michael
5854,"Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?",jim
5855,"He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.",michael
5856,What a night.,jim
5857,"Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged.",michael
5858,She was always engaged.,jim
5859,Roy said the first one didn't count.,michael
5860,"That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so...",jim
5861,"Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan...",michael
5862,"Yeah, I know.",jim
5863,"Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute.",michael
5864,"Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.",jim
5865,"Well, if you like her so much, don't give up.",michael
5866,She's engaged.,jim
5867,BFD. Engaged ain't married.,michael
5868,Huh.,jim
5869,"Never, ever, ever give up.",michael
5870,"Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore.",dwight
5871,"It's a fake wheel, dummy.",michael
5935,"Hey, Captain Jack, what kind of fish they got in this lake?",dwight
5937,"You know, my grandfather told me there was a monster here that eats Catholics. Have you heard...",dwight

5973,"No, I really don't want to.",jim
5976,Yeah! Toast!,michael
5978,Yeah.,pam
5980,"Thanks, Katy. Um, didn't really prepare anything to say. We're all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she's awesome. And...",jim
5981,"Okay, okay. My turn, my turn. Is this thing on? Uh, I want to congratulate the happy couple. You know, they say that marriage is an institution. And I say, who wants to be in an institution?",dwight
5982,"That's my line! That's my line, That's... I always say that at weddings. So I'll just think of something else to say. I... [band starts playing]",michael
5992,"[off camera] Yeah, that's right.",jim
5993,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.",pam
5994,Pam! It's Michael.  Help me!  I need help right now.,michael

6000,"No, I want you to pick me up.",michael
6001,What?,jim
6002,Ok...,pam
6003,What's going on?,jim

6005,I am hurt. I hurt my foot.,michael
6006,I'm sorry? Pam.,jim
6007,[exasperated],pam
6008,What is going on?,jim
6009,I want to come to work.  But I need you to come and pick me up. [Jim lunges across Pam's desk and puts Michael on speakerphone],michael
6010,OH GOD!,michael
6011,"Hey, whoa, Michael...",jim

6013,"It's, okay, it's Jim.  Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.",jim
6014,"OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.",michael
6015,You burned,jim
6016,"I enjoy having breakfast in bed.  I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me.  And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself.  So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill.  Then I go to sleep.  When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again.  Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon.  It is delicious, it's good for me.  It's the perfect way to start the day.  Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that's it.  I don't see what's so hard to believe about that.",michael
6017,"Pam, could you come get me?!",michael
6018,"Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone.",pam
6019,"Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?",michael
6021,There's no toilet paper here.  Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper.  Could you tell 'em that?,michael
6023,"I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.",michael
6024,[panicked] No one wants to pick me up!?,michael
6025,"[silence, Dwight enters the office] What is going on? What is going on?",dwight
6026,"Michael, is, um, sick and he wants one of us to rescue him.",pam
6027,I'm not sick! I'm burned!,michael
6028,I'm coming Michael!,dwight
6029,Oh...,jim

6032,Hold on Michael! I am coming! Wait there!,dwight
6033,I don't want Dwight!,michael
6034,"Michael, why don't you call your girlfriend?",pam
6035,I don't have a girlfriend.,michael
6036,But you said that you went out with her this weekend.,jim
6037,"It was all made up.  Just someone come, ok?  Anyone.  Anyone but Dwight.",michael
6038,[sounds of a car crash] What was that...,jim
6039,What was that?! [everyone runs to Michael's office window],pam
6040,Oh!,jim
6041,Ohhhhhh!,pam

6047,Is he ok?,pam
6048,"He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!",jim
6049,Hellooo? ... Please don't send Dwight!,michael
6050,"Morning everyone.  Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out.  Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing.  I just want to be treated normally today.  Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through.",michael
6051,"You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate.",pam
6052,Did you explain why?,michael
6053,"No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot.",pam
6054,"Burned my foot, Pam.",michael
6055,Please stop popping my cast.  Thank you.,michael
6056,"So, where are you shipping your foot?",jim
6057,Ha ha ha.  So where are you shipping...,michael
6058,Your foot?,dwight
6059,"Thank you.  Pam, messages please?",michael

6062,And do my job?,pam
6063,"No, your job is being my friend, Pam.  OW! God!",michael
6064,[holding mini-fan]  It slipped.,dwight
6065,What?,michael
6066,Sorry.,dwight
6067,"It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment.",pam
6068,"I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma.  I don't think that's too much to ask.",michael
6069,"Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy.",pam
6070,"No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy.  Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing.  I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.",michael
6071,"Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to.",dwight
6072,What?  Part of your duties are to what?,michael
6073,What?,dwight
6074,You just said 'part of your duties are to' something.,michael
6075,"No, I didn't.",dwight
6076,"Yes, you did.  What is wrong with you?",michael
6077,What is wrong with,dwight
6078,Where is my cornbread?,michael
6080,Thank you.  Did you get all dark meat like I like?,michael
6082,Where are the yams?,michael
6084,Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg?,michael
6086,And they had no yams?,michael
6088,How strange.  Because they always have yams.,michael
6089,"Aw, man, is that a Prism Duro-Sport?",dwight
6090,You've seen one of these?,pam
6091,"Yeah, they're like an i-Pod only they're better 'cause they're chunkier and more solid.",dwight
6092,Roy gave it to me for Christmas.  I'm trying to figure out how to put songs on it.,pam
6093,"Oh, no no no.  Don't go there.  I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece.",dwight
6094,Really?,pam
6095,"Yeah, I'll write down the address for you.  Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding!",dwight

6115,That is so cool.  Thanks Dwight!,pam
6116,Yep.,dwight
6117,"So, I guess Pam and Dwight are friends now.",jim
6118,"Oh God no, Dwight isn't my friend... Oh my God!  Dwight's kind of my friend!",pam
6119,"No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom.  No, I'm not gonna call Jan.  She'd just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that?  No, it was mutual.  What is Pam doing chatting with you?",michael
6120,Huh. Do you like candy?,dwight
6122,Cause you're sweeter than candy.,dwight
6127,"[loud noise in bathroom] No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me!",michael
6129,I fell off the toilet.  I'm caught between the toilet and the wall.,michael
6131,"Ugh, not you.  Someone else.  Get Pam.",michael
6133,Get Ryan.  He needs to lift me. [Ryan shakes his head] and he needs to clean me up a little bit.  Bring a wet towel.,michael
6135,"No, he's not.",michael
6137,I just saw him.,michael
6139,"Ugh, forget it.  I'll just get up myself.  No!  Uh, aaaahhh!  Ah!  Oh God!",michael
6140,Do you think Dwight's bein' a little weird today?,jim
6141,"No, he's actually been really nice and helpful.",pam
6142,And that isn't weird?,jim
6143,Wow...,pam
6144,"Can I have everyone's attention please?  Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who's supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question?  Do you all know what it's like to be disabled?  Oscar?",michael
6146,"No, never heard of it.  No, a",michael
6148,"Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I'm sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.",michael
6150,"Ok, [lifts up cooked foot] what does this look like to you Stanley?!",michael
6152,"Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about.  You people are jerks.  Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me.",michael
6154,"[sigh] I burned my foot!!!  Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there!",michael
6155,[looking up at Creed] Dad?,dwight

6157,"Quick question: uh, why is Tom Hanks on the wall?",jim
6159,"Good question.  Forrest Gump: mentally challenged, Philadelphia [points to a picture from Big]: AIDS.",michael
6161,"I don't think so, no.",michael
6163,"He grew into a man overnight.  Rare disability, still works. [sigh] A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here?",michael
6165,What you mean uh hmmm... ?,michael
6167,Ok.,michael
6169,"Yes, right in here, come on in.",michael
6171,"This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.",michael
6174,You are so brave. You are so brave.,michael
6176,But it's hard for you! Right? Because you're in a wheelchair.,michael
6178,"Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?",michael
6180,"Oh my God, that's three times as long as it takes me.",michael
6181,How did you get in your wheelchair?,michael
6183,"Hey, hey, hey, not funny! Not funny.",michael
6185,"Well, that's good, he still has a sense of humor.",michael
6187,"Well they notice it.  Don't you?  You notice it.  It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it?",michael
6188,I want to clamp Michael's face in a George Foreman grill.,jim
6190,Ok...,michael
6192,"Dwight, you have your hand up.",pam
6193,"Ignore him.  You know what?  We're not that different, you and I.  When I clamped my foot into a non-stick...",michael
6195,Yeah...,michael
6197,Ok.,michael
6199,Did you see Born on the Fourth of July?  I was under the impression that Billy would be more like that guy.,michael
6201,You mean today?  He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.,jim
6203,[popping his bubble wrap cast] Hey!,michael
6205,"You did it!  Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin.  Very nice.  Thank you, Ryan.",michael
6207,Did you get the yams?,michael
6209,"[sigh] Ok, I'll just have the pudding.",michael
6211,Yeh.,michael
6213,You know what?  I feel better.  Ryan brought me some chocolate pudding and his kindness healed my foot.,michael
6214,"Yeah, baby, I am feelin' better.  My body's literally healing itself.  It is amazing what the human body is capable of when you have a powerful brain.",michael
6216,"Uh, finally feel the blood coursing through my foot veins.",michael
6217,"[hits his head on his desk]  Uh, ugh, ohhhh...",dwight
6218,"Uh, ok, I think we need to take him to the hospital because I'm pretty sure he has a concussion.",jim
6219,"Oh, now you feel some compassion for him.",michael
6221,Why don't you go with him?,michael
6223,I want Michael to take me...,dwight
6224,"I can't take you, I don't have my car and yours is all vomity.",michael
6226,"Oh, ok, that's, great.  No, I can't drive.  Jim why don't you drive.",michael
6227,Fine.,jim
6228,"We'll go.  I'm still recovering. So let's just, Ryan, could you get my coat please.",michael
6229,"Slowly, slowly.  Let's just get to the elevator.",jim
6230,Choo choo choo choo choo choo...,dwight

6232,Vietnam sounds.,dwight
6233,"[Dwight falls onto the couch] Stop, stop, stop, stop.",jim

6250,Where we going?,dwight
6251,I just want to say goodbye ok?,pam

6259,Come here.,pam
6260,"Oh, huggy hugs.",dwight
6261,Shotgun!,michael
6262,You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?,jim
6263,The rules of shotgun are very simple and very clear.  The first person to shout 'shotgun' when you're within the sight of the car gets the front seat.  That's how  the game's played.  There are no exceptions for someone with a concussion.,michael
6264,"Oh, God, a mini-van.  What is Meredith's problem?",michael
6265,"Well, I think she has a kid.",jim
6266,"Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband.  She's not gonna find one driving this thing around.",michael
6267,Where are we going?,dwight
6268,"Come on, get inside.",jim
6269,Where are we going?,dwight
6270,We're going to Chuck E. Cheese.,jim

6304,What do I write under 'reason for visit'?,michael
6305,Concussion. [Michael scribbles something out] What did you write?,jim
6306,Nothing.  I wrote 'bringing someone to the hospital'.,michael
6307,So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.,jim
6308,"No... you know what Jim, this isn't about me anymore.  I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him. [Dwight falls towards Jim]",michael
6309,Come on Dwight. [sprays Dwight],jim
6310,Hi Michael!,dwight
6311,Hi Dwight.,michael
6312,Ahhh.  Mweehaa,dwight
6313,"Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?",michael
6315,"Well, you don't have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.",michael
6317,What is that?,dwight
6318,"Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?",michael
6320,"Ok, what kinda machine is that?",michael

6327,"Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off.",michael
6328,I don't want to do this.,dwight

6330,Oh.,dwight
6331,Fine. Fine.,michael
6332,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.",pam
6333,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim.",jim
6334,"Oh my God, what is going on, is Dwight ok?",pam
6335,"Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.",jim
6336,I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan.,pam
6337,Michael went in there with him too.  It's pretty sweet.,jim
6338,Really? Michael went in with him?,pam
6339,Uh huh.,jim
6340,Wow.,pam
6341,"But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon.",jim

6343,Ok.,jim
6344,Ok. Bye.,pam
6345,Bye.,jim
6346,"Hey, Oscar?",pam

6401,"Oh, I can not believe I fell for that. [laughing] Oh, my God.",pam

6424,"Today is spring cleaning day here at Dunder Mifflin. And yes I know its January. I am not an idiot. But, if you do your Spring cleaning in January; guess what you don't have to do in the spring?  Anything.  They say a cluttered desk means a cluttered mind.  Well I say that an empty desk means a...",michael
6425,Empty mind.,dwight

6427,"Meredith, men's room. Make sure you replace the urinal cakes.  They're worn down. Kevin file drawers. Angela kitchen. Oscar dusting. Where is Oscar?",dwight
6429,That's unacceptable.,dwight
6432,Michael.,dwight
6433,Yes.,michael
6434,Oscar is out sick.,dwight
6435,On a Friday? [Dwight nods],michael
6436,Can I do some of the talking?,dwight

6440,What difference does it make whether your here?,michael
6442,"Hi, Oscar its Michael.",michael
6443,And Dwight.,dwight
6444,"Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather?",michael
6446,"Really? Oh, that is a shame.  You know it's cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic.",michael
6448,Ask him his symptoms. I'm on Web M.D.,dwight
6449,What are your symptoms?,michael
6451,"Umm, hmmm.",michael
6453,Checks out.,dwight
6455,I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday.  Unless you're still sick.  So have a great long weekend.,michael
6457,Ok. First impressions?,dwight
6458,He sounded sick.,michael
6459,Which is exactly how you'd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.,dwight
6460,That's exactly what I was thinking.,michael
6461,Question? May I investigate?,dwight
6462,Yeah. Drop what you're doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can't function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.,michael
6463,I bought my veil.,pam
6465,Ummm...,pam
6467,"Ok. I was thinking about wearing it down. Kind of like, I don't know, like loose with big curls and...",pam
6469,"Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don't you wear your hair like that all the time.  It's much sexier. [Pam puts hair back up] [Michael walks by Jim] Man, this must be torture for you.",michael
6470,Yeah. On the booze cruise I told Michael about some feelings I used to have for Pam. I had just broken up with Katy and had a couple drinks. And I confided in the world's worst confidant.,jim
6471,Hey Michael.,jim
6472,Hey Jim-bag.,michael
6473,Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.,jim
6474,Really?,michael
6475,"Umm, hmm.",jim
6476,Who else knows?,michael
6477,Nobody.,jim
6478,Wow!,michael
6479,"Jim and I are great friends. We hang out a ton, mostly at work. But, the fact that he told me his secret and no one else knows says everything about our friendship.  And it is why, I intend on keeping that secret for as long as I possibly can.",michael
6480,My lips are sealed. [singing] My lips are sealed... Bangles.,michael
6481,Alright. Great. Thank you.,jim
6482,"[singing] Can you hear me, they talk about us...",michael
6483,Listen Temp. I am conducting a little investigation so I'm no longer going to be able to head up spring cleaning.  Do you think you can handle it?,dwight
6485,Do you,dwight
6487,"[low] Oh God, here.",dwight
6488,"Hey, whatcha gettin'?",michael
6489,I'm going with grape.,jim
6490,"Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night?",michael

6503,"Hey Oscar how ya doin'? Dwight Schrute calling.  Listen a little question for you, buddy.  I called six minutes ago and no one answered. So I was wondering if you could explain. Oh, I see, so. Sounds like you're too sick to come into work but your well enough to go to the pharmacy.",dwight
6504,"There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth.  The liar will perspire.  Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful.",dwight
6505,It's Grrrrrrape! Soda.,michael
6506,Tony the tiger.  You don't hear that much any more.,jim
6507,Not so much.,michael
6508,"Ok, what is going on here?",dwight
6509,Nothing.,michael
6510,"Oh, really nothing? Fact: You are drinking grape soda. You never drink grape soda.  Fact: You are talking to Jim. You never talk to Jim.",dwight
6511,Fact: I love grape soda. I always have. Fact: Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets.,michael
6512,Ok. So what is the secret Michael?,dwight
6513,"Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.",jim
6514,Is that true?,dwight
6515,"Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.",michael
6516,Thank you Michael.  I know your telling the truth.,dwight
6517,Ok.,michael

6519,Good.,michael
6520,Thanks.,jim
6521,"Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick.  What are you doin' for lunch?",michael
6522,I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.,jim
6523,"Oh nonsense [lifts leg and puts it on Jim's desk], no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat.",michael
6524,"No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.",jim
6525,Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room.  Have a little picnic order some 'za. Talk about you know who.,michael
6526,"Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea.  Let's go out.",jim
6527,I know just he place.,michael

6532,"We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers.",michael
6533,Nope we're not brothers.,jim
6534,I'm his boss actually.  And I treat him well. I'm taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.,michael
6535,"Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.",jim
6537,"Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?",michael
6539,"Mmmm, sounds yummy.  I will have a chicken breast hold the chicken. [Giggles]",michael
6541,"No, I'm gonna have the gourmet hot dog.",michael
6543,Who took all the black ones?,dwight
6544,That's a communal bowl.,pam
6545,"So, how did Oscar sound when he called in?",dwight
6546,"Sick, like lots of sniffling. I don't know.",pam
6547,Sniffling how?,dwight
6548,Umm. How many different ways are there to sniffle?,pam
6549,Three.,dwight
6550,"Ok, it was the second one.",pam
6551,"Ok, good, thank you.  That wasn't so hard now was it?",dwight
6552,Nuh-uh.,pam
6553,What do you like best about Pam?,michael
6554,"Uh, I really don't want to talk about it.",jim
6555,"Is it her boobs, or...",michael
6556,"Um, she's easy to talk to I guess and she's got a really good sense of humor.",jim
6557,Really?,michael
6558,Uh-huh.,jim
6559,Never get's any of my jokes.,michael
6560,What about you?,jim

6576,I hate you.,pam
6577,Quick Oscar update. I have conducted interviews with everyone in the office.,dwight
6578,Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.,michael
6579,Including prep time?,dwight
6580,Just do it.,michael
6582,[Michael messes up hair to look like Jim's] Expenses.,michael
6584,No. It's... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig?,michael
6587,"Yeah, it's a business lunch.",michael
6589,No he did not. I don't need his permission.,michael
6591,"Uhhh it's ridiculous. They took my card away because I spent $80 bucks at a magic shop. What they don't understand is that I bought the stuff to impress potential clients. So business related, right?",michael
6592,I put a cigarette through a freakin' quarter.  And you know what Toby? They almost bought from us.,michael
6594,"Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity.  How is that not work related?",michael
6596,"You're not his friend, you don't know. He is in love with a girl he works with who's engaged.  So just cut me some slack. Please?",michael
6603,"You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me.",michael
6604,"As a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy I have been doing surveillance for years.  One time I suspected an ex-girlfriend of mine of cheating on me.  So I tailed her for six straight nights.  Turns out she was, with a couple of guys actually so... mystery solved.",dwight
6606,Well the cats out of the bag. I used to have a crush on Pam and now I [hesitate] don't. Riveting.,jim
6608,Hey.,pam
6609,Hey.,jim
6610,Did you find anything good in your desk?,pam
6611,"Ah, coupon for a free sandwich.",jim
6612,Score.,pam
6613,"It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.",jim
6614,Big day.,pam
6615,Big day.,jim
6616,"Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It's so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here.",jim
6617,Oh.,pam
6618,"Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.",jim
6619,Right.,pam
6620,"And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.",jim
6621,"No, I know, like, I kind of like, I thought that maybe you did when I first started.",pam
6622,Oh you did?,jim
6623,"No, I mean, just 'cause we like got along so well.",pam
6624,"No, no, you saw through me, great.",jim
6625,So are you going to be like totally awkward around me now?,pam
6626,"Oh yeah, yeah... hope that's okay.",jim
6627,"Mmm, hmm.",pam
6628,And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.,jim
6629,Cool.,pam
6630,Ok.,jim
6631,"Stay low... This is it... There he is. He's been gone for at least two hours. Who is that? Come to Papa... Oh yes. Let's roll. I knew it! You are so busted. Ice skates, shopping bags? I think I know what's going on here. You weren't sick at all.",dwight
6633,This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this?,dwight
6636,How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor.  Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.,dwight
6637,"Guess what I found out about Oscar tonight? He was lying about being sick. Should I have reported Oscar's malfeasance. Hmm, probably, but now I know something he doesn't want me to know. So I can use his malfeasance to establish leverage.  Otherwise, it's just malfeasance for malfeasanceses-ses sake.",dwight
6638,Hey.,jim
6639,"I know, I know, I know.",michael
6640,"Umm, what happened?",jim
6641,"I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. I'm just, I just hope that, I just hope that [starts to get choked up] this doesn't affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid.",michael
6642,"Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal.",jim
6643,"Ok, I'm fine, no I know, I'm good, I'm good, it's just.",michael

6653,"Oh, no, that's, you don't have to.",pam
6654,"No, I feel it's my responsibility as your boss slash friend.",michael
6655,"No, really, it's okay. I know that Jim had, like a crush on me when he first started. But that was a long time ago, so.",pam
6656,It wasn't that long ago. It was on the booze cruise.,michael
6657,Jim had a crush on me on the booze cruise or he told you about it on the booze cruise?,pam
6658,"Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. I'm done. That's it. I'm out.",michael
6659,Ready?,jim
6660,Yep.,pam
6661,"People are always coming to me. 'Michael, I have a secret.  Your the only one I trust.' No thanks, because keeping a secret can only lead to trouble. Like I was watching Cinemax last weekend.  This movie, Portrait of a... Prostitute something. Secrets of a Call... More Secrets of a Call Girl. And the lead character, Shila, is framed for murder. She goes on the run and winds up working at a bordello in Malibu. I don't, I don't want to live like that. I like it here. I don't want to be Shila, I like being Michael Scott.",michael

6756,[coughing] It's still stinky.,dwight
6757,That is worse.,michael
6758,She probably scrubbed it,dwight
6759,"[while in his reeking office]  I am a big Fear Factor fan.  I'm a big fan of anything Joe Rogan does, actually, so this is sort of like my audition tape.  Um... [clearing throat]   I can't stand it [gets up to leave], I can't stay in here another second.  No!",michael
6760,Hey!  Welcome back!,jim
6761,Thanks!,pam

6769,[sitting at Jim's desk]  Hey Jim.  I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.,michael
6770,That might be a little difficult with the one computer.,jim
6771,Oh... It's ...,michael
6772,But there's definitely a desk open in the back.,jim

6792,No way!,dwight
6793,Yeah.,michael
6794,And who had your office?,dwight
6795,"Ed Truck. [exclaiming is disgust]  Ed Truck was the manager before me.  Horrible.  He hated fun.  It was like, 'Oh, Ed Truck is walking toward us.  Stop having fun.  Start pretending to do work.'  What a jerk.  He's... You know what?  I swore to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager, people would laugh when they saw me coming and would applaud as I walked away.",michael

6800,No!,dwight
6801,Yeah.,michael

6804,Ah.,dwight
6805,"When I was in training, many years ago... not so long ago... I worked side-by-side with a fellow named Todd Packer, and together we rocked the office [picture behind Michael falls].

6808,"Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm. [laughs] Okay.",michael
6809,"Another time, Packer held this guy's head in the toilet for like a minute.  Guy had no sense of humor about it.  Probably why he wasn't hired.",michael

6840,You're gonna throw my things on the ground?,pam
6841,Maybe!,michael
6843,"Why would somebody ruin a perfectly good carpet?  I don't know.  It could be done out of hate.  It could be done out of love.  It could be completely neutral.

7331,Ahhh! Excellent.,michael
7332,Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.,michael

7534,Hey.,pam
7536,"I guess, yeah.",pam

7543,"No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously. [Jan looks at Michael]",michael
7545,"I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. [David grins]",michael

7644,That's what she said!,michael
7645,Ha! I don't get it.,dwight
7646,Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?,michael

7649,"Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just...

Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.",michael
7650,"What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, 'Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very...'",dwight

7674,I do. Both of them.,michael
7675,Could I have a copy of one of them?,dwight

7733,"Confidence, Dwight.",michael
7734,Dwight. If you could travel anywhere in the world where would you go?,jim
7735,I can travel anywhere except Cuba. And I will travel to New Zealand. And walk the 'Lord of the Rings' trail to Mordor. And then I will hike Mount Doom. So... no... just leave me alone.,dwight

7737,Oh please! You're not taking any trip.,dwight
7738,You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.,jim

7741,Yes. I am.,dwight

7767,"Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent?

7812,What? Something happened?,dwight
7813,"Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.",michael
7814,Weird.,dwight
7815,"Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.'",michael
7816,Con artist.,dwight
7817,She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?,michael
7818,"Dwight gave a great speech. That's the word on the street anyway. And I entertained Dwight to no end with my bar stories. So, I captivated the guy who captivated a thousand guys. Can you believe that? A thousand guys?",michael

7999,"No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.",michael

8293,"It's 'For the Longest Time,' by William Joel. It's you favorite song.",dwight

8463,"To think that a man's skin could turn on him. It's brilliant, 'cause you'd never expect it. Most people think of their skin as an ally. [scoffs] Makes me rethink having skin at all.",dwight

8520,Do you think it's possible that maybe you could have had some drugs in your system without you knowing about it?,dwight
8522,Have you ever... pooped... a balloon?,dwight
8524,He sure left in a hurry.,dwight
8525,I don't want to blow this. This is what all good law enforcement officers dream of. The chance to solve an actual crime.,dwight
8526,Do you know what this is? [pushing a photo toward her],dwight
8528,How do you know that?,dwight
8530,[grabs pictures back and looks at it] Dammit.,dwight
8532,"No, it's marijuana.",dwight
8533,I'm just saying that you can't be sure that is wasn't you.,jim
8534,"That's ridiculous, of course it wasn't me.",dwight
8535,"Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.",jim
8536,I would remember.,dwight
8537,"Well, how could you, if it just erased your memory?",jim
8538,That's not how it works.,dwight
8539,Now how do you know how it works?,jim
8540,"Knock it off, okay, I'm interviewing you.",dwight
8541,No! You said that I'd be conducting the interview when I walked in here. Now exactly how much pot did you smoke?,jim
8542,[opens eyes wide in total surprise],dwight
8544,"Oh, um...[mimicking Stanley] Why do you keep CC'ing me on things that have nothing to do with me?  [Pam and Oscar laugh, Stanley walks in, and Oscar leaves quickly]",jim
8546,"Oh, hey Stanley. Uh, I was just doing an impression.",jim
8548,He does everyone in the office.,pam
8551,Jinx! Buy me a coke.,pam
8552,Oh...,jim
8553,"No, no, no, no talking. Jim is not allowed to talk until after he buys me a coke.  Those are the rules of jinx, and they are unflinchingly rigid.  [Jim puts money in drink machine, selection is sold out]",pam
8554,Sold out? That has never happened in the history of jinx.,pam
8555,[mouths] C'mon!,jim
8556,"Sorry, that's not my problem.",pam
8557,"[presses drink button, looks at camera, makes Jim-face]",jim
8558,"I know you're innocent, but I can't look like I'm treating you any differently.",dwight
8560,Where were you yesterday after work?,dwight
8562,Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Who's he calling?  Ratting somebody out.  Narc!  Narc!  Kevin?,michael
8564,"Remember the narc bit? [laughs] Uh-oh, who's in trouble?",michael
8565,Attention everyone.  Drug testers are coming in a couple of hours to test everyone's urine.,dwight
8566,Waa... what? What are you talking about?,michael
8567,Company policy. If drugs are found on the premises there is automatic drug testing conducted within twenty-four hours.,dwight
8570,"Two nights ago, I went to an Alicia Keys concert at the Montage Mountain Performing Arts Center. I scored these great aisle seats. Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.",michael
8571,"Okay, attention everyone the drug testing has been cancelled.  Instead, I will be going around to each of you and doing a visual inspection.",michael
8572,No you can't do that.,dwight
8573,"I can do that, it is my office.",michael
8574,"No you cannot. It has to be official, and it",dwight
8575,Hmmm. Ha. [under his breath] Alright. Great.,michael
8576,"Kevin, what prescription drugs are you taking, besides Rogaine?",dwight
8578,"Angela, what about you?",dwight
8580,You're not on,dwight
8582,Good.,dwight
8584,"Hey guys, what's going on?",pam
8586,"Oh, okay.  Well, Michael wants to see everyone in the conference room. [Jim shakes his head. Seems relieved to be getting away from Kelly] But you know what? We have a few minutes so you guys should definitely finish up your conversation. [Jim nods his head as if to say, 'Gee, thanks, Pam.']",pam
8588,It has come to my attention that some people here think that the use of drugs is something to laugh about.,michael
8592,"No, uh, no. That was a test.  I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him?  How many of you said, 'Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs.'",michael
8593,"Thank you, Michael.",dwight
8594,"I am ridiculously anti-drug. So anti-drug that I am above suspicion in any way that involves suspicion, or testing of any kind.",michael
8595,"Drugs ruin lives people. Drugs destroy careers. Take Cheech and Chong everybody knows that Cheech and Chong are funny, but just imagine how funny they would be if they didn't smoke pot.  I want everybody to take a look to their left. Now I want everybody to take a look to their right. One of those people will be dead from drug use at some point in their lives. This year more people will use cocaine than will read a book to their children.",michael
8597,"Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?",michael
8599,Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?,michael
8601,"Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?",michael
8603,Yes it is.,michael
8605,"Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down? [Pam throws her hands up to indicate she has no notepad] In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.",michael
8607,"I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.",michael
8609,"Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random.  Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one.  Yeah, Pam.",michael
8610,I know that Jim has an amazing story about a relative of his who got caught up in the world of drugs.,pam
8611,Really? [Jim shakes his head no],michael
8612,"Uh, hmmm.",pam
8613,"Jim it's okay. You can t... [Jim looks at Pam and shakes his head, Pam looks at him and gestures for Jim to go up and tell his story] This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. [Jim shakes his head no] It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. [Jim stands up] Oh, he's doing it, okay. [Jim looks at Pam] It's okay. [Jim pretends to try, looking teary eyed, shakes his head no, mouths 'I can't' and sits back down. Pam is amazed.] Oh. Okay, are you sure? [Jim shakes his head. Kevin pats his shoulder] That looked like it was going to be good. Alright. [Pam nods in admiration at Jim] Okay, well.",michael
8614,Wow! He really pulled out the big guns. Fake crying. Did not expect that.,pam
8615,"The point I'm trying to make with all of this people is that I hate drugs. I hate them, and based upon what I have seen you all don't quite hate 'em as much as I do so you are going to have a drug test, and I am not.",michael
8616,"No, you will be tested.",dwight
8617,"Yes, I will not be.",michael
8618,You will be. That is the law according to the rules.,dwight
8619,"Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.",michael
8620,"Hi, Linda. Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager. You might remember testing my urine a few years back when I was applying to be a volunteer sheriff's deputy.",dwight
8622,Mine was green.,dwight
8624,I'm all better.,dwight
8625,So I need you to do some work on the St. Andrews account. I need your urine. I need some filing done.,michael
8626,What kind of filing?,dwight
8627,Just forget it.  Just the urine.,michael
8628,That goes directly to the tester.,dwight
8629,Just. I need your urine.,michael
8630,Like in a cup?,dwight
8631,"Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.",michael
8632,For what purpose?,dwight
8633,It's none of your business.,michael
8634,Then I refuse.,dwight
8635,"Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.",michael
8636,Are you serious?,dwight
8637,I need clean urine for the lady.,michael
8638,But that's illegal.,dwight
8639,"Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes",michael
8640,Not my urine.,dwight
8641,A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.,michael
8642,Were you forced to do drugs at this concert?,dwight
8643,"No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup.",michael
8645,I want him to have all the urine he needs.,dwight
8647,I know that. Don't you think I know that?,dwight
8652,"My father's name was Dwight Schrute. My grandfather's name was Dwight Schrute. His father's name Dwide Schrude. Amish. I loved my father very much. Every morning he'd wake up at dawn and make us biscuits with gravy. When I was little my dad and I played a lot of games together. My dad cheated a lot but I never busted him on it. I would have, except I didn't know about it. He didn't tell me till years later. I was shocked when I found out.",dwight
8653,"What? [Jim shakes his head] Did you want to tell me something? You look like you want to tell me something. [Jim shakes his head no] You look like you have something really important to say and you just can't for some reason. [Jim smiles] Come on, you can tell me. Jim, you can tell me anything. [Jim stops smiling and looks down. Pam wonders what that means]",pam
8657,"Dwight. Well, I passed the test thanks to you and your untainted pee. Thank you very much.",michael
8658,That's great.,dwight
8659,What's wrong? Where's your costume?,michael
8660,It's a uniform and I turned it in today when I tendered my resignation.,dwight
8661,Why?  Wha...,michael
8662,I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.,dwight
8663,[placing a coke can in front of Jim] Here. [Jim looks confused] Just buy it from me. I haven't talked to you in hours and it's been weird and I really want to know what the hell's going on with Dwight. [Pam scoots the coke can towards Jim.  Jim pulls out his wallet and hands Pam a dollar.  He gives the coke back to Pam],pam
8664,Hi.,jim
8665,Hey.,pam
8666,How much time do you have left on your break?,jim
8667,Ten minutes.,pam
8668,"Since you did such a good job with the investigation, I decided to pull a few strings. Call in a few favors. and I've decided to make you official security supervisor of the branch.",michael
8669,Really?,dwight
8670,"Yes, sir.",michael
8671,That's fantastic because I've always felt that the security here sucked .,dwight
8672,So you wanna? Thanks.,michael
8674,Okay.,michael
8676,"Thank you, Michael. Very nice. Great. [To Hank]  Can I have a gun?",dwight
8678,"Okay, I'll have to bring in my bow staff.",dwight
8680,Good.,michael
8681,"[salutes] Thank you, Michael.",dwight
8682,No. Oh. Uh...[awkwardly salutes],michael
8683,I need to go over some details with you.,dwight
8684,"Alright. [to Hank] Well, Thank you.",michael
8685,"First of all, Hank, how many orange traffic cones do you have?",dwight
8687,"Oh, God.",dwight
8688,Wow. What a terrible day to not be able to talk.  Dwight was literally carrying around his own urine and dressed like one of the Village People. Why does he do the things that he does for Michael?  I just don't get it. What is he getting out of that relationship?,jim
8774,No.,pam
8776,"Yeah, I mean it's inevitable. I definitely overhear some wedding preparation, but I'm fine with it. She hears me arranging my social life. And we both have to hear Dwight order deer urine over the Internet, so it evens out.",jim
8778,Yeah?,pam
8780,"Oh, thanks!",pam
8782,Uh...,pam
8783,"There are a few people I decided not to invite, and that might make things kind of awkward but ...  it's my wedding. And I don't want anyone there who has called me a hussy.",pam
8784,"Yes, thanks, Fantastic Sam's. Adult Cut Plus. Comes with a shampoo and blow dry. We're doing I.D. photos today. Gotta represent.",michael
8788,Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?,dwight
8790,Clown paint.,dwight
8791,"I.D. badges are long overdue. Security in this office park is a joke. Last year, I came to work with my spud gun in a duffel bag. I sat at my desk all day, with a rifle that shoots potatoes at 60 pounds per square inch. Can you imagine if I was deranged?",dwight
8792,That's a nice tie.,michael
8794,That is... who makes that?,michael
8796,Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?,michael
8799,[walking into the Conference room] What's the dealio?,michael
8801,What's the problem?,michael
8805,"So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?",michael
8808,Yes.,michael
8810,Yeah?,michael
8812,Okay.,michael
8814,What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...,michael
8816,Okay... what?,michael
8818,"Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized. [leans over to Pam] Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?",michael
8819,"[holding up a binder] A mediator's tool chest. Okay, well, before we get started, you should know that are 5 different styles of conflict.[in a comedic voice] My Shaolin temple style defeats your monkey style.",michael
8821,"No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.",michael
8823,"Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?",michael
8825,"Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.",michael
8826,"[in front of poster] Okay, since this is the disputed poster. Now, one at a time, I want you to express your feelings using 'I' emotion language and no judging or 'you' statements.",michael
8828,"Come on, seriously, that?",michael
8830,"Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.",michael
8831,Win!,pam
8832,"Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.",michael
8835,"Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution.",michael
8838,"How about, Angela can keep it up on Tuesdays and Thursdays?",pam
8839,"Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.",michael
8840,Win.,pam
8843,[claps his hands twice] It is done!,michael
8844,Win,pam
8847,"Hey, Angela.[hands her a Save The Date card] I didn't have your zip code.",pam
8851,Yes.,michael
8853,Are those all the other complains?,michael
8855,I would like to see those please.,michael
8857,"You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.",michael
8859,"Okay. [yanks the file away, despite Toby's resistance] There! No more conflict. [looks at the camera] I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty. [looks back at Toby] All right... is that it?",michael
8862,Ohh... God. Alright. Why do I have to do everything?,michael
8864,"Oh, he's sure. Just shoot.",dwight
8866,"[looking through papers in the complaint box] This is from Kevin. He says Stanley uses his Miracle Whip without asking. Meredith complains that everyone talks too loud in the morning and the lights are too bright. Creed... huh. Duh, duh. Creed is sick of looking at the redhead all day and wants a seat facing the receptionist.",michael
8867,Nice.,pam
8868,You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.,michael
8870,"How many of you have at one time gone to Toby to complain about another employee? [looks at all the employees, most of whom raise their hands] And... did you get what you wanted, or were you merely listened to, you forget about your problem, and you move on? [employees mumble 'merely listen to and forgotten...' ] That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering... [sighs] Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?",michael
8872,"That's what she said. [Jim mouths these words along with Michael] The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does 'redacted' mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked 'redacted'... ?",michael
8874,"Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.",michael
8875,"Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?",dwight
8876,[notices Angela's intense concern] Um... let's move on. I volunteer. Did anyone have a problem with me?,pam
8877,"All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And [looks through the file]... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.",michael
8878,"Wait, what did it say?",pam
8879,"Uh... [reading]'Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?' [Pam looks Angela an angry look] Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?",michael
8880,I have this kind of big secret about Angela. And I've been really nice to her... and I haven't told anyone. And what the hell?!,pam
8881,"Here is a Kelly complaint: 'Ryan never returns my calls.' Ugh, join the club.",michael
8887,[crumbles up the complaint paper] Makin' progress. [Jim raises his hand] Yes?,michael
8888,Dwight tried to kiss me.,jim
8889,What?!,michael
8890,And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.,jim
8891,That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!,dwight
8892,"Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.",jim
8893,"Okay, question. [looks at Toby] When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?",dwight
8895,Stanley. [off camera],michael
8896,"[gets up and walks over to Angela, whispering to her] Hey. Thanks for ratting me out!",pam
8897,[still of camera] You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.,michael
8899,I find that hard to believe... considering you have problems with every single person in this entire office except Bobblehead Joe.,pam
8900,"Someone complained that the men's room is 'whites only'. Stanley, you know that's not true.",michael
8903,"Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.",michael
8905,"And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.",michael
8908,Oh... ok.,michael
8910,"I can't believe Angela. I went against my better judgment, and I gave her a Save The Date. And now it turns out she complained about me to Toby.",pam
8911,"Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.",jim
8912,Don't take her side.,pam
8913,"[sighs] Well, what does Roy think about everything?",jim
8914,I don't know. I try not to bother him about this kind of stuff.,pam
8915,You mean your thoughts and feelings?,jim
8916,Yeah.,pam
8917,Yeah...,jim
8921,"Okay, well... all settled, then.",michael
8923,"OK, Ryan.  You told Toby that Creed has a distinct old man smell?",michael
8925,"All right, Kevin. You are accused of making sexually suggestive remarks to Angela that made her feel uncomfortable. Solution:  Angela, you are to make sexually suggestive remarks to Kevin that will make him uncomfortable.",michael
8927,"Hey... you know what, Dwight? Maybe we should get our photo I.D. taken together.",jim
8928,That doesn't make any sense.,dwight
8929,"Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.",jim
8931,No.,dwight
8932,"I never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates. When someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.",dwight
8933,This came out really well. [picks up Dwight's I.D. from the laminating machine and hands it to Dwight] There you go.,jim
8934,This is humongous. I am not a security threat...,dwight
8935,Oh.,jim
8936,"And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.",dwight
8937,What did I write?,jim
8938,I have another complaint for Jim's permanent file.,dwight
8940,What box?!,dwight
8943,Uh. Dwight.,michael
8944,"Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.",dwight
8945,Okay! Calm down.,michael
8946,No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?,dwight
8947,"Hey, hey!",michael
8948,Him or me?,dwight
8949,Stop.,michael
8950,Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.,dwight
8951,Okay...,michael
8952,"Either he goes, or I go.",dwight
8953,Dwight...,michael
8954,You choose!,dwight
8955,Stop...,michael
8956,One of us is out of here by the end of today! [runs out],dwight
8957,Oh... kay...,michael
8958,I am not bluffing!,dwight
8959,Okay.,michael
8960,Okay?,dwight
8961,Yes.,michael
8962,"Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.",dwight
8963,Mm-hmm.,michael
8964,I deserve this. You know I do!,dwight
8965,[picks up Dwight's I.D. and snickers] You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?,michael
8966,You have till five.,dwight
8967,"Oh, look, Jim. There's a sales manager position open in Stamford. Want me to call Jan and tell her you're interested? I could put in a good word for you, 'cause I'll still be working here. Transfer! Transfer! Everybody! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer! Transfer!",dwight
8968,"Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!",michael
8969,"Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.",michael
8970,"Okay, so Dwight, in your own words - [reads from complaint paper] 'Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons. I suspect Jim Halpert.' [flips to another paper] 'Everyone has called me 'Dwayne' all day. I think Jim Halpert paid them to.'",michael
8971,[laughs] Yes! Five bucks each. And it was totally worth it.,jim
8972,"[reading] 'This morning, I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I committed murder. I think he may be the real murderer.' [flips to another paper] 'Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the woman's room. When I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can.'  Gah. 'This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone.'",michael
8973,"That actually took a while. I had to put, uh, more and more nickels into his handset, till he got used to the weight, and then I just... took 'em all out.",jim
8974,"[reading] 'Every time I typed my name, it said 'Diapers'.'",michael
8975,"Just a simple macro. You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it, though.",jim
8976,"By the end of the day, my desk was about two feet closer to the copier.'",michael
8977,"Yeah, I just moved it an inch every time he went to the bathroom. And that's how I spent my entire day that day.",jim
8978,"The Japanese have this thing called shiatsu massage, where they dig into your body, very hard. And it is very painful. And apparently, some people throw up. But the next day they feel great. I've never had one. They sound awful.",michael
8979,Maybe Stanford would be cool.,jim
8980,It's a good market. Higher volume.,dwight
8981,Yeah. Maybe we should both go.,jim
8982,I have a girlfriend...,dwight
8983,"Sure you do, Dwight. Sure.",jim
8984,"Hey, there's like, 300 more of these. Let's get to them later.",michael
8985,"So, you going to transfer Jim or not?",dwight
8986,"Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.",michael
8987,I want an answer by tomorrow.,dwight
8988,"Okay. Oh... actually, tomorrow's not good. How about later in the week?",michael
8989,Fine.,dwight
8990,Good. Okay.,michael
8991,Hey! Wait. How about a group picture while you're here?,michael
8993,"Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?",michael
8995,It'll take like two seconds.,michael
8997,"Ugh... All right. Everybody, [looks around at the employees] come on. Group photo for the newsletter.",michael
8999,"Come on, everybody.",michael
9000,"Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.",dwight
9002,"We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.",michael
9004,"Good, let's check that out. [looks at preview screen] Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more.",michael
9006,What?,michael
9007,"Angela, I want to talk to you about something.",pam
9008,[off camera] You just press the button.,michael
9010,"No, Pam.",jim
9011,[looks at to Jim] I am. [looks at Angela] It's about the Save The Date.,pam
9012,"Pam, it wasn't her.",jim
9013,What?!,pam
9014,I'm the one who complained about you.,jim
9015,I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down. [the camera flashes] I was just venting.,jim
9016,"[off camera] Okay, good. Check that out.",michael
9017,"You know, it was one day.",jim
9018,[off camera] That's terrible.,michael
9019,And I took it right back. It was like...,jim
9020,Okay.,pam
9022,"[off camera] Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger. [rejoins the group, on camera] Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go. [flash goes off before he sits down]",michael
9023,It was really hard getting a good picture of fifteen people. He would not give me a good discount. And eight tries added up.,michael
9024,"[flashback the photo being taken] One, two..[flash goes off] Didn't say three, did I?",michael
9025,"But, I'm sort of an expert at Photoshop, so it turned out fine in the end. When people work together, there is going to be conflict. You can't outrun your problems.",michael
9026,"[on Pam's answering machine] Hey, Pam... it's Jim. Um, I have a doctor's appointment in the city. So I probably won't be in till the late afternoon. Just thought I'd let you know. Okay, bye. [camera shows Jim sitting on a waiting coach in another Dunder Mifflin office]",jim
9028,"Oh, thanks.",jim
9029,And that is why the idea of a cage match is so universally appealing. But here's the thing about cage matches: sometimes you have to open the cage. And that is something Toby will never understand.,michael
9078,"Tonight the Scranton Business Park is having Casino Night and we are converting our warehouse into a full-blown gambling hall. And I know it's illegal in Pennsylvania, but it's for charity. And I consider myself a great philanderer. It's just... It's nice to know at the end of the day, I can look in the mirror and say, 'Michael, because of you, some little kid in the Congo has a belly full of rice this evening.' Makes you feel good.",michael
9079,Excuse me. How long is the wait for a table for two?,jim
9080,"I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.",dwight
9081,It's a nice tux.,pam
9082,"I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.",dwight
9084,"Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert.",pam
9085,"Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.",dwight
9086,I can always kind of win at roulette.,jim
9087,"Oh, really? Mmm-hmm.",dwight
9088,Yeah.,jim
9089,How would you do that?,dwight
9090,Mind control.,jim
9091,[laughs] You can't be serious. Are you serious?,dwight
9092,"Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.",jim
9093,I don't believe you. Continue.,dwight
9094,"It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.",jim
9095,"[scoffs] That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.",dwight
9096,"Okay, I'll try. [The coat rack wobbles] [Pam holds up an umbrella handle to the camera in another scene]",jim
9097,"Oh, my God.",dwight
9098,I try not to think of it as lagging behind. It's more of a David-and-Goliath thing.,michael
9100,Top 80 percent!,michael
9102,Yeah?,michael
9104,"Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!",michael
9106,"Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.",michael
9108,"I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.",michael
9110,"Oh, come on. Come on.",michael
9112,"You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.",michael
9114,"Jan and I understand each other. The romance thing is sort of on hold for the time being, but we've remained good friends. Good friends with privileges. Not now, some day.",michael
9115,"Okay, everybody. Tonight's event is to benefit the Boy Scouts of America.",michael
9117,"Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts.",michael
9119,"Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.",michael
9120,Yes!,dwight
9121,"So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.",michael
9122,That doesn't exist anymore.,jim
9123,"Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.",michael
9124,"No, they stopped making that show.",pam
9125,"Well, then, they need our money more than ever.",michael
9131,"Oh, and another fun thing. We, at the end of the night, are going to give the check to an actual group of Boy Scouts. Right, Toby? We're gonna...",michael
9133,"Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS.",michael
9134,I think you mean the aid to Afghanistan.,jim
9135,"No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.",michael
9137,What?,michael
9139,That's a dog.,michael
9140,"No, that's Afghan.",pam
9141,That's a shawl.,michael
9142,"Wait, canine AIDS?",dwight
9143,No. Humans with AIDS.,michael
9145,"Guys, the Afghanistananies.",jim
9146,"Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.",michael
9147,"There are certain topics that are off-limits to comedians, JFK, AIDS, the Holocaust. The Lincoln Assassination just recently became funny. 'I need to see this play like I need a hole in the head.' [laughs] And I hope to someday live in a world where a person could tell a hilarious AIDS joke. It's one of my dreams.",michael
9148,What are you doing?,jim
9149,"Oh, nothing.",pam
9150,Till Death Do Us Rock.',jim
9151,They're wedding bands.,pam
9152,Oh.,jim
9153,"Roy was supposed to pick the band, but he's concentrating more on the bachelor party now.",pam
9154,"Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams.",jim
9155,There's a KISS cover band in here.,pam
9156,Let's do it.,jim
9157,I'm pretty happy these days. I'm getting married soon and I'm getting along with everybody at work.,pam
9158,"Why did I talk to Jan about transferring? Well, you know... I have no future here.",jim
9159,I have already put down the deposit. Do you understand how a deposit works?,michael
9161,It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place.,michael
9163,"Well, actually, it's my warehouse.",michael
9164,"Actually, it's owned by Beakman Properties, and Dunder Mifflin is four years into a seven-year lease.",dwight
9165,Why are you here?,michael
9166,"When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection.",dwight
9167,"Not. I said, not that.",michael
9169,That's ironic.,michael
9171,That you are afraid.,michael
9173,Dinkin' flicka.,michael
9176,Give me some. [Michael and Darryl perform simultaneous hand gesture],michael
9178,[Jim ejects a videotape from the VCR and puts in a new one] Wow. I don't know how you're gonna decide. They are all extremely good.,jim
9179,I think I should hire them all. Do like Lollapalooza.,pam
9180,Yes.,jim
9181,"Have three stages, yeah.",pam
9182,"Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.",jim
9183,Oh.,pam
9184,Let's take a look. Nice.,jim
9185,"Oh, wait. That's Kevin. On the drums.",pam
9186,What?,jim
9187,On the drums! On the drums!,pam
9188,"Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh,  my God, he's the drummer and the singer.",jim
9190,Wow. Oh!,jim
9191,"Oh, my...",pam
9192,"Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna...",jim
9193,No! No!,pam
9194,"No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding.",jim
9195,"No, come back! No, no, no!",pam
9196,Kev!,jim
9197,Jim is great. Being with him just takes away all the stress of planning my wedding.,pam
9198,[phone rings] Yes,michael
9199,"[phone rings] Michael, Carol Stills for you.",pam
9200,Who?,michael
9201,Carol Stills.,pam
9202,Do I know a Carol Stills?,michael
9203,Your realtor.,pam
9204,"Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it",michael
9205,It's still me.,pam
9206,Sometimes I don't put Michael through until he's already said something. I look at it as a practice run for him. He usually does better on the second attempt.,pam
9207,"Carol, you're on with Michael.",pam
9209,"Hi, Carol. How you doing?",michael
9211,"Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.",michael
9213,"Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It's okay. At Christmas, the tree helped.",michael
9215,"Actually, I'm sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night.",michael
9217,"Yeah, it'll be good. You know what? Why don't you come by? Bring the papers, I'll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.",michael
9219,Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you...[phone rings] What do you...,michael
9221,"Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?",michael
9222,"Michael, Jan's on line two.",pam
9223,"Okay, put her through. [Deep voice] Jan Levinson, I presume?",michael
9224,"It's still me. Uh, Jan, here's Michael.",pam
9226,"Hey, Jan. How you doing?",michael
9228,I am?,michael
9230,"Oh, okay.",michael
9232,AIDS.,michael

9236,"Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just...",michael
9238,Right.,michael
9240,Yeah?,michael
9242,What?,michael
9244,Okay.,michael
9246,Problem. Good.,michael
9248,"Good, All right. Sounds great.",michael
9250,Bye.,michael
9252,Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.,michael
9253,"[People playing casino games as the actual Casino Night begins] Oh, my God!",pam
9255,"Hey, hey.",michael
9257,"Hey, Carol.",michael
9259,You look great.,michael
9261,"Oh, well... Kiss. [Michael kisses her on the cheek, pauses and then kisses her on the other cheek] That's how we do it in the paper biz. It's European and... Yes? Ah, Dwight [Kisses cheeks]",michael
9262,Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.,dwight
9263,"I'm Michael's wingman. I've got his back. Two dates. He's got two dates tonight. My job is to keep Jan away from Carol and vice versa. Michael said, 'We must deceive them, so as not to hurt them, and in that way, we honor them.'",dwight
9264,Can I get you a drink? The food is from Hooters.,michael
9266,Okay.,michael
9271,"Billy, your nurse is hot.",michael
9273,Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.,michael
9275,Chili's is great.,michael
9276,"Welkommen, Bienvenue, and welcome to Monte Carlo! Dwight. I am no longer your boss. Lady Fortune is your boss.",michael
9278,"Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled!  Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let's get it started! Black-Eyed Crows.",michael
9280,All-in. [Other players fold their hands],michael
9281,"Bluffing is a key part of poker, which is too bad, because I'm not very good at bluffing. Did you believe me?",michael
9283,What are... That's insane.,michael
9285,"Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn't that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don't be stupid. Just take it back.",michael
9287,"Okay, all right, whatever.",michael
9289,You really screwed that up. [Michael leaves],michael
9292,"I expect to do very well tonight. I have an acute ability to read people. Jim, for instance, has a huge tell. When he gets a good hand, he coughs.",dwight
9293,[coughs] I will raise. [Dwight sighs and folds his cards] Thanks.,jim
9294,"It's the weirdest thing. Every time I cough, he folds.",jim
9296,"Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren't involved, I would always be winning. [Sees Jan] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.",michael
9298,Jan.,michael
9300,"Look, okay, I think we're all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.",michael
9303,"After you said you weren't coming, I invited Carol to come and I don't think that I did anything wrong.",michael
9309,Um...,michael
9310,"Hey, hey.",dwight

9326,Give me the dice!,dwight
9327,"Yeah, right.",jim
9328,"Yeah, right,' what?",pam
9329,What was this? [Makes face],jim
9330,[Laughs] I have good cards.,pam
9331,Really?,jim
9332,"Mhmm, And I'm gonna take you all-in.",pam
9333,Wow. I think you're bluffing.,jim
9335,Straight.,pam
9336,Oh. Three nines.,jim
9338,Thank you very much. It was fun.,jim
9347,"So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly?",jim

9412,"Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?",jim
9413,About when you want to give me more of your money?,pam
9414,"No, I...",jim
9415,Did you wanna do that now? We can go inside. I'm feeling kind of good tonight.,pam
9416,I was just... I'm in love with you.,jim
9417,What?,pam
9418,"I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...",jim
9419,What are you doing? What do you expect me to say to that?,pam
9420,I just needed you to know. Once.,jim
9421,"Well, I um... I... I can't.",pam
9422,Yeah.,jim
9423,You have no idea...,pam
9424,Don't do that.,jim
9425,...what your friendship means to me.,pam
9426,Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna be,jim
9427,I can't. I'm really sorry if you misinterpreted things. It's probably my fault.,pam
9428,Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship.,jim
9430,"Hey, okay.",michael

9434,Okay. Thanks for coming.,michael
9438,Okay. Talk to you Monday.,michael
9441,Good night. She's a good boss.,michael
9443,"Oh, she's great.",michael
9444,"Love triangle. Drama. All worked out in the end, though. The hero got the girl. Who saw that coming? I did. And Jan was really happy for me. So actually the hero got two girls. He got the girl that he works with and he got the girl that he buys real estate from. So, I've got my New York girl and my local flavor. Life is good.",michael
9445,"[On phone] About 10 minutes ago. No, I didn't know what to say.  Yes, I know.  Um, I don't know, mom, he's my best friend.  Yeah, he's great.  Yeah, I think I am. [Jim enters] I have to go. I will. Listen, Jim... [They kiss]",pam
9456,"Apparently Michael has come up with a Dunder Mifflin Mad Lib, and he's making us play it with him. We are so happy. No. I'd like to choose a different adjective.",pam

9458,The planet Caprica.,dwight
9459,Where the hell is that?,michael
9460,It's from Battlestar Galactica.,dwight

9463,"No, no, no. No, no, not until you give me an adjective.",michael
9465,We already have that. So...,michael
9467,"No, Toby, damn it, come on! We already have that. I need something fun. Something like fat or smelly. Or pukey. Pukey. Pukey's good. Okay. Pukey. Now I need a noun.",michael
9469,"Good. Thank you, Phyllis. That wasn't so hard. All right, here we go. 'Office Depot is an annoying store. One day Creed went there to buy paper. And he ran into irritating Cylons.'",michael
9470,"Yeah, get them, Creed!",dwight
9471,"One of them was named Michael Scott, and he was an...' Oh, damn it. Okay. Okay, okay, we're... Okay, we're starting over.",michael
9482,"Our numbers are down, yes, but we have a heck of a crew here in Scranton. Hardworking, motivated, dynamic. Every single last one of them. They follow my lead. I sort of set the tone. And it doesn't hurt that my ex works for corporate. Jan loves this branch, and I think that's really more than half the battle.",michael
9490,[after 'the kiss'] You have no idea how long I've wanted to do that.,jim
9491,Me too.  ...I think we're just drunk.,pam
9492,No I'm not drunk.  Are you drunk?,jim
9493,No... [Jim leans in for another kiss] Jim---,pam
9494,Are you really gonna marry him?  [Pam nods] ...Ok.,jim
9495,"[sobbing] Jim is gone.  He's gone.  I miss him so much.  Ooooh I cry myself to sleep, Jim!  [serious]",dwight
9496,No!  That is the fun of this place.  I call everybody 'faggie'. Why would anybody find that offensive?,michael
9498,That's what faggie means!,michael
9501,"It wasn't just an action movie, it was Die Hard!",michael
9503,Exactly!,michael
9505,"Yeah, I know.",michael
9507,"OK, a little too far, crossed the line.",michael
9509,I would have never called him that if I knew.  You don't... You don't call retarded people 'retards'.  It's bad taste.  You call your friends 'retards' when they're acting retarded.  And I consider Oscar a friend.,michael
9510,"Listen man, I am so sorry.  I had no idea.",michael
9512,"No.  No it's not.  I feel terrible about it.  I have been calling people 'faggie' since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake.  If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know?  I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing.  Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime.  And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude.",michael
9516,"I can't say whether Dunder Mifflin paper is less flammable, sir, but I can assure that it is certainly not more flammable.",jim
9517,Why did I transfer to Stamford?  I think that's pretty obvious.  I got promoted!  And you can't beat that view... right?,jim
9518,"Hey, Big Tuna!  You're single right?",andy
9519,"Uh-huh, yeah.  I am.",jim
9520,She's pretty hot huh? [Jim nods]  She's completely crazy.  Steer clear Big Tuna.  Head for open waters.,andy
9521,OooOK.,jim
9522,OooOK.,andy

9524,"Big Tuna is a super ambitious guy, you know?  Cut your throat to get ahead kind of guy, but I mean I'm not threatened by him.  I went to Cornell, you ever heard of it?

9531,Absolutely not.,dwight
9532,"Well, he",michael
9533,"Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so...",dwight

9541,Do some research.  Find out if there's a way to tell by just looking at them.,michael
9542,Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.,dwight
9543,That's ridiculous.,michael
9544,Yeah probably.  He didn't tell the truth a lot.,dwight

9546,Definitely.,dwight
9547,What's gay-dar?,jim

9584,"[looking at gay porn] Nothing wrong with this stuff.  At all.  This is fine.  You know what.  Gay porn, straight porn, it's all goooooood!  I don't particularly get into this.  But uh, you know what.  I totally see the merit!  And actually... it is quite beautiful.",michael
9585,Ah damn pop-ups.,dwight
9588,"[yelling] All right, everybody in the conference room!  I don't care if you are gay, or straight, or a lesbian, or overweight!  JUST GET IN HERE!  RIGHT NOW!",michael
9589,"Did you know that gay used to mean happy?  When I was growing up it meant lame.  And now it means a man, who makes love... to other men.",michael
9590,"We're all homos!  Homosapiens.  Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are, people.  I mean anybody could be gay.  Business-men.  Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants.  Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here.  However you want to do it.  Go ahead.  Stand up.  I'm doing this for you.",michael
9593,Who should be the judges and juries of our society?,michael
9595,"Yes, that's a good point.  She has a good point.  Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law.  I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them.  So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could.  You know?  Sounds pretty good, right?",michael
9597,"I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them.",dwight
9599,What about Phyllis?  She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!,dwight
9601,"That's great.  Congratulations Phyllis.  That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing!  [laughs] See?  Everybody has a chance!",michael
9602,"But still, Phyllis, in college?  Did you ever experiment with other women?  A lot of women do!",michael
9604,[laughing] Right!  [serious] And I take that as a compliment.,michael
9606,"Well, I just like to look good OK, so ---",michael
9608,"No, I am just coming out myself.  I am coming out hetero!",michael
9610,No no no.  The only signal that I am sending is:,michael
9611,"Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen.  I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... I would be waving that rainbow flag.",michael
9613,"You misunderstand-- OK.  You know what, OK.  I uh, I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is.  You ready?  I am going to embrace Oscar.  You might want to watch this Angela, because you can't catch anything.  Here we go.  We are going to make a statement.  You and I are going to make a statement together.  Oscar is my friend ---",michael
9615,"...and I just don't care who sees it, doesn't bother me!",michael
9617,"All right, um... sorry.",michael
9619,[sobbing] I'm sorry I called you faggie.  You're not faggie.  You're a a good guy.,michael
9620,Michael appears to be gay too.  And yet he is my friend.  I guess I do have a gay friend.,dwight
9621,"[embracing Oscar]You know what, I'm going to raise the stakes.  I want you to watch this.  And I want you to burn this into your brains.  Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come.  Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this.  [awkwardly kissing Oscar]  I did it.  See.  I'm still here.  We're all still here. [everyone claps]",michael
9622,"[Dwight gets up to kiss Oscar]  Oh come on!  Dwight!  Come on, man!",michael
9623,"We are not in the playground anymore.  There are new rules.  We have to be mature.  But we can't lose the spirit of child like wonder.  What is love...  anyway?  Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules.  Like me and Jan.  Or Oscar... and some guy.  Life is short.  When two people find each other, what should stand in their way?",michael
9624,"I am glad that today spurred social change.  That's part of my job as regional manager.  But you know what?  Even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed.  ...that's what she said.  Or he said.",michael

9627,[reading the note with the gay-dar]  'Hope this helps.  -Jim'  Nice!,dwight
9629,"Shhh.  Don't be scared.  [gay-dar beeps over Oscar's belt buckle, Dwight smiles] It works.  [gay-dar goes off next to Dwight's belt buckle]  ...oh no.",dwight

9667,What was Oprah about?,pam
9668,"Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost.",michael
9669,That's a really big decision.,pam
9670,I know.,michael
9671,Maybe you should wait before you adopt.,pam
9672,Well...,michael
9673,Or not adopt.,pam
9674,"Just do it, okay?",michael
9675,"Roy's sister looked into it, and the application alone costs a thousand dollars.",pam
9676,"Um... find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?",michael
9677,"You know, she also said the waiting list is like eight months.",pam
9678,Eight months?,michael
9679,Yeah.,pam

9744,"Well, I did it too.",dwight
9745,"You know, when I saw Dwight, I realized how stupid and petty all those pranks I pulled on him were. And then he spoke. I wonder how hard it would be to get a copy of his room key.",jim
9751,So what kind of commissions you get up there?,dwight
9752,"Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much.",jim
9753,You're so immature!,dwight

9770,Mm-hmm.,pam
9772,This party is going to be awesome.,dwight

9783,"Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen?",michael

9837,Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left?,michael
9838,"Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...",jim
9839,"Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically.",michael
9840,"Michael, it's really not a competition.",jim
9843,"Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip.",michael
9844,Whoa. Michael.,dwight
9846,You're welcome.,michael

9879,Come on!,michael
9881,Come on!,michael
9884,Fine.,michael

9954,Best friends.,michael
9955,"Some people need dozens of friends to say, 'Hey, look at me, I'm popular.' But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly.",michael

10059,[exhales] I can't talk here.  It's too sensitive.,dwight
10061,"No, but we should discuss that another time.",dwight
10063,"Pull over at exit 40.  There is a Liz Claiborne outlet.  I know you like that store.  Go inside and shop, until I can meet you.",dwight
10065,Many of your blouses are Claiborne's.,dwight
10067,Part of my job.,dwight
10069,...noted.,dwight
10070,[walking into Michael's office] I'm going... to the dentist.,dwight
10071,Ok.,michael
10072,I have to have an emergency crown put in.,dwight
10073,Ouchy.,michael
10074,Yes.  It's a new dentist.  He's far.  I might be gone... three hours.,dwight
10075,"Three hours, wow.  Have fun.  [Dwight walks away staring through the blinds at Michael]",michael
10076,Did you get anything good?,dwight
10078,New blouse?  Halter top?  Camisole?  Teddy?,dwight
10079,I can save the branch.,dwight
10081,If you let me run it.,dwight
10083,[excitedly] 'Ok' I can run it?,dwight
10085,Mostly get rid of waste.  Which is half the people there.  And clean house.  [to waitress in diner]  Right here.  It's all for me.  Thank you.,dwight
10087,"The decision to turn on Michael was difficult.  [pouring way too much syrup on his food] But once I did it, I didn't look back.  And mostly I feel that Michael would approve.  It's really what's best for the branch.  And I could care less about my co-workers.  So [cutting his food, giving Jan a 'so there' look], here we are.  It's all, on the table.  I want... the branch.  And I await your decision.",dwight
10088,"[shoveling waffles into his mouth] Oh, by the way.  There's a new Ann Taylor outlet store near here.  I know you like their earrings.",dwight
10091,Hi.,michael
10093,Oh.  That's nice.,michael
10095,...what?,michael
10097,...you were at the dentist?,michael
10099,Ok.,michael
10100,What was Dwight thinking?  That he could turn Jan against me?  She's my ex-lover!  ...ish.,michael
10104,[smiling] It's too much.,pam
10106,I'm gonna return it.,pam
10109,Hi.,pam
10111,Thanks.,pam
10113,"Yeah I think we can be a big help to your company.  [someone dims the lights, signifying that it's game time]  Ok, see you next week.  Bye.  [to Karen] Again?",jim
10117,Now?,andy
10119,Put the game on hold everyone.,andy
10121,It's the new guy. [looks at Jim],andy
10122,"Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about...",jim
10123,See what I mean?,andy
10125,"Um, sniper rifle?",jim
10127,WHAT?,andy
10129,Are you playing for the other team?!,andy
10131,Saboteur!,andy
10133,Saboteur!  I'm going to kill you for real.  This game--- the game is over.  I'm really going to shoot you.,andy
10134,Hey Dwight.,michael
10135,Hey.,dwight
10136,Do you want an M&M?,michael
10137,No thanks I'm stuffed.,dwight
10138,"No seriously.  You should have an M&M, they're really good.",michael
10139,...ok. [takes and eats several M&M's],dwight
10140,"They're good, huh?",michael
10141,...so good.,dwight
10142,Hey.  I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in.,michael
10143,"They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so...",dwight
10144,Sounds like a good dentist.,michael
10145,"Oh, yeah.",dwight
10146,What's his name?,michael
10147,[long pause] Crentist.,dwight
10148,Your dentist's name is Crentist.,michael
10149,Yep.,dwight
10150,Huh.  Sounds a lot like dentist.,michael
10151,Maybe that's why he became a dentist.,dwight
10152,Let me see your teeth.  Let me see 'em.  Let me see 'em.,michael
10153,[reluctantly opens his mouth and Michael peers inside]  Ahh.  Aaaah.,dwight
10154,You should... floss.,michael
10155,I know...,dwight
10156,[exhales] Well then... I am glad you're ok.,michael
10157,"Business is like a jungle.  And I... am like a tiger.  And Dwight, is like a monkey, that stabs the tiger in the back with a stick.  Does the tiger fire the monkey?  Does the tiger transfer the monkey to another branch?  [smiling] Pun.  There is no way of knowing what goes on inside the tiger's head.  We don't have the technology.",michael
10158,"Dwight, can I talk to you for a second?",michael
10159,"[in Michael's office] Wow, this is tough.",michael
10160,What?,dwight
10161,Ohhhh.  Arrrgggh!,michael
10162,What is it?,dwight
10163,"Well, I just got off the phone with Jan.  And um... she demoted me.",michael
10164,No.,dwight
10165,Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job!,michael
10166,Gahh!,dwight
10167,"And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.",michael
10168,I can't believe this news.  That--- wow.,dwight
10169,I know.  I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it... because you've always been so loyal to me.  You've been my most trusted ally.,michael
10170,You said that?,dwight
10171,"Yep, I did.  I did.  But I think... you should do it.",michael
10172,"Well... Gosh, if you think I should.  Then I will.",dwight
10173,"[exhales] Perfect, well, we're settled.",michael
10174,All right.,dwight
10175,"All right.  Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager.",michael
10176,"Assistant to the regional manager.  Thank you Michael, for staying on.   I really appreciate it.",dwight
10177,Ohh..,michael
10178,Hey... I can't imagine this place without you.,dwight
10179,[muttering] Can't you?  That's so nice.,michael
10180,Well... I guess we should go tell the troops.,michael
10181,"Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike. [Dwight exhales, Michael looks at the camera] Ok let's do it.",dwight
10182,"Hey, hi, hello.  Everybody, I have some good news, and I have some bad news.  I... am being replaced, as your leader, by Dwight.",michael
10184,"You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that.",michael
10186,Thank you Angela.,dwight
10188,"Because, Dwight... never lies.",michael
10190,Because that's all it takes.,michael
10191,"Ok, Dwight, would you like to say a few words to everybody... about loyalty?",michael
10192,"Thank you Michael.  I just want to say, to the few of you who will remain under my employ, that I intend to lead you into the black!  With ferocity!",dwight
10194,"Oh, I'll be fine.",michael
10196,"No, no, I don't, but---",michael
10198,I... won't.   I won't.,michael
10199,"I have this little vacuum cleaner that's broken.  If Dwight doesn't work out, maybe that could be manager.",pam
10202,Yes.,dwight
10204,I,dwight
10206,"Oh please, don't be naive.  But you can be in charge of the women.",dwight
10208,I'm sorry what are you whispering about?,jim
10210,I'm trying---,jim
10212,Oh.,jim
10214,"What? [Karen's player shoots Jim's player, 'You killed Jim Halpert' appears on the screen, Karen giggles]",jim
10215,Wow. Psychopath.  [Karen grins widely at Jim],jim
10216,What?,pam
10218,Please go back to your desk.,pam
10220,"Well, I remember why I dress the way I do at work.  But I'm gonna keep the clothes.  I mean, it'll be cool to just have some after work clothes that aren't pajamas.",pam
10221,"Well, I guess it's time, that I turn over the keys, to the famous Sebring.",michael
10222,[smiling] No thank you.,dwight
10223,"It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it.",michael
10224,No thanks.,dwight
10225,What?,michael
10226,Not my style.,dwight
10227,But you said you liked it.  You've always admired it.,michael
10228,"Well that was before.  I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage.  Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate.",dwight
10229,[Michael finally breaks] Take it back.,michael
10230,[confused] No.,dwight
10231,That's my car.,michael
10232,What did you---,dwight
10233,THAT'S MY CAR.,michael
10234,Yes.,dwight
10235,"I know, Dwight.  I know.  I know.  I know.",michael
10236,You know what?,dwight
10237,Jan called me about your little meeting!,michael
10238,No!,dwight
10239,"I know, what you did.  I made the whole thing up, Dwight.",michael
10240,I think the Sebring's cool.  It's cool.  The Seabring's cool.  It has a cassette and it has a CD.,dwight
10241,"Oh do you?  Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?!  How dare you, Dwight?",michael
10242,[Dwight gets on his knees and puts his face down on the ground] Don't fire me.  Please.,dwight
10243,Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?!,michael
10244,[terrified] I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS!,dwight
10245,Not.  Good.  Enough!,michael
10246,[sobbing] I'll do anything!  Anything!  I'll do your laundry for a month!  For a year!,dwight
10247,I have a laundry machine!,michael
10248,"I'm sorry!  I'll do anything, I swear. [squeaking, crying]",dwight
10249,I don't know if I can trust you anymore.,michael
10250,"You can't.  You can't.  But I promise I'll never betray you again.  What can I do, Michael.  What can I do?  [Michael exhales]  What can I do?  [Dwight has his face to the ground but his butt raised high in the air] What can I do?  What can I do?",dwight
10251,"You can get up.  Get up. [Dwight gets up with spit hanging from his lips] And you can hug it out, bitch.  [Dwight and Michael have a firm embrace]",michael
10252,"Hug it out, bitch.  That is what men say to each other, after a fight.  They hug it out, and doing so, the just... let it go.  And walk away.  And they're done.  Not a good idea to say that to a woman however.  I have found.  It doesn't translate.",michael
10253,"[leaving his desk for the day, pretends pull the pen out of a pretend grenade, and tosses it to Karen]",jim
10255,"Yep.  Yeah, we hugged it out.  But, it turns out, I was still a little angry.  So, I felt I needed to punish him, just a little bit more, [cut to Dwight standing on a box with 'LIAR' written on a piece of paper hung around his neck, Dwight's head hung in shame] and I'm making him do my laundry for a year.",michael
10256,Okay. [Jan leaves Michael's office; Dwight enters],michael
10257,Hey. [shuts door] Is everything okay?,dwight
10258,"It is not your business, Dwight.",michael
10259,"If the branch is in trouble, there are things you can do.",dwight
10260,"What do you know about management, Dwight?",michael
10261,I know that we need to cut costs.  We could fire Meredith. That's a big cost.,dwight
10262,I'm not firing anyone.,michael
10263,"Creed might be living here, we could charge him rent.",dwight
10264,... What?,michael
10266,"Okay. Here we go. Everybody, you know what? It dawned on me we were all in there watching a movie together before we were so rudely interrupted, Let's get back in there. [no takers] Come on. Movie Monday! Come on, Stanley let's go.",michael
10268,Ryan?,michael
10270,"Okay, well, we had scheduled this time to watch a movie together, so I guess I will just go play some online Scrabble.",michael
10271,[looks to Angela],dwight
10273,"The Schrutes are a very loyal breed. But I also have Mannheim blood from my German grandmother. And the Mannheims knew when to cut and run. No sense going down with a losing regime. But the Schrute blood... It's amazing that when these two bloods mix, the whole thing didn't explode.",dwight
10274,"So, she sleeps with him, but she is still in love with the head surgeon, um, the McDreamy guy, and she starts crying, but the dorky doctor, he's in love with her... [phone rings]",michael
10275,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. ... Uh, sure, I'll get him for you. [to Michael] It's Jan for you.",pam
10276,Really?,michael
10277,Yeah.,pam
10278,"I may have a few weeks ago faked a call from Jan in order to get out of a synopsis of, I think it was, Navy: NCIS. Since then, Michael's been suspicious.",pam
10280,"[playing Call of Duty] Oh? Someone's left out in the open, taking a little siesta. Not smart. [shoots] Yes! Finally killed you... [Karen's desk is empty]",jim
10282,"Hey, Jan.",jim
10284,[nervously] Pretty good.,jim
10286,[baffled expression],jim
10287,Things are a little bit... different here in Stamford. [shrug] It's not bad.,jim
10288,"Hey Ryan, can I get you a pencil from the warehouse?",michael
10290,"Oh, it's okay, I'm going down.",michael
10292,"All right, I'll be right back. [goes down pretend stairs]",michael
10293,[laughs uproariously and applauds] Whoo!,dwight
10294,[hands Ryan pencil]  There you go.,michael
10295,Awesome!,dwight
10297,You're welcome.,michael
10298,"Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse?",dwight
10299,Don't mind if I do.  See you in a minute.  [goes back down pretend stairs and grabs pen from Stanley's desk],michael
10300,Okay. [continues to laugh] Whoo!,dwight
10301,"There you go, fresh from the warehouse.",michael
10302,"Hey Michael, would you get me some coffee from the warehouse?",pam
10303,"There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam.",michael
10304,But the warehouse coffee tastes SO much better.,pam
10306,"[breathless] All right.  Okay. [goes back down pretend stairs, crawls on belly to the kitchen for the coffee]",michael
10307,I am like Bette Midler in For the Boys.  Gotta keep the troops entertained.,michael
10308,[after Michael returns with coffee] With cream and sugar?,pam
10309,[sighs] All right.,michael
10311,"Oookay.  Let me see if I have his cell.  Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan?  Or does somebody miss me?",michael
10313,"Oh, wow.",michael
10314,"Attention, everybody.  I just received a call from corporate with some news they felt that I should know first.  My old boss Ed Truck has died.",michael
10316,"Yes, I am.  It's very sad.  Because he was my boss.",michael
10318,"That's right, you worked with him.  So did Creed.  Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by.  Cheer me up.",michael
10319,So did you hear the news?,michael
10320,The news that you just announced?  That Ed died?,pam
10321,Yeah.,michael
10322,Is there anything I can do?,pam
10323,"Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really?  It's... pssssh... .  He was almost 70.  Circle of life.",michael
10324,Yeah.,pam
10325,[holds out arms to Pam],michael
10326,Oh.  Okay.,pam
10327,Yeah.  Mmmmmm.,michael
10328,[extricating herself] Okay.,pam
10332,"Oh yeah, definitely.",jim
10333,"[coughing out his words] Suck up!  Josh, did you hear what I said?",andy
10336,What's up?,jim
10338,Oh.,jim
10340,"Mmm, that's where you're wrong.  I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require.  So, I think we should go get some.  Now, please.",jim
10342,Yeah.  Must really have you thinkin'.,michael
10344,"The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die.  You knew that.",michael
10346,What?,michael
10347,Really?,dwight
10349,Oh my God.,michael
10350,That is the way to go.  Instant death.  Very smart.,dwight
10352,You're thinking of a chicken.,dwight
10354,"That is just not the way a Dunder Mifflin manager should go, I'm sorry.  Alone, out of the blue, and not even have his own head to comfort him.",michael
10355,"[clears throat] So, I'm not exactly sure how to say this...",michael
10356,Ed was decapitated.,dwight
10357,What are you doing?,michael
10358,You said you didn't know how to say it.,dwight
10359,I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck.  And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him.  And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.,michael
10360,Hey.,dwight
10362,"If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice.",dwight
10364,"When I die, I wanna be frozen. And if they have to freeze me in pieces, so be it.  I will wake up stronger than ever because I will have used that time to figure out exactly why I died and what moves I could have used to defend myself better now that I know what hold he had me in.",dwight
10365,"I don't understand. We have a day honoring Martin Luther King, but he didn't even work here.",michael
10367,"You really don't get it, do you?  You don't understand these people.  That is the last thing that they would want is a day off.",michael
10369,[thoughtfully] A statue.,michael
10371,Yeah.,michael
10373,"Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him.",michael
10375,"We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move...",michael
10376,"That is not a statue, that is a robot.",dwight
10377,I think that is a great way to honor Ed.,michael
10378,And how big do you want this robot?,dwight
10379,Life-size.,michael
10380,"Mm, no.  Better make it two-thirds.  Easier to stop if it turns on us.",dwight
10382,"Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan.",michael
10384,Mm hm.,michael
10386,Oh do you?  You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck.,michael
10388,But Ed truck can't because he is---,michael
10390,DEAD.,michael
10391,Look [holding up sketch] I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us.,dwight
10392,That's perfect.,michael
10393,"Okay, that is a 'no' on the on the West Side Market.",jim
10395,Wow.  Never pegged you for a quitter.,jim
10397,Really?,jim
10399,Hey.  What are we doing?   What's the game?  I want in.,andy
10400,"Oh, there's no game.  We're just trying to get these chips for Karen.",jim
10401,Did you check the vending machine?,andy
10403,I have no idea.  We went right for the copier.,jim
10405,And then we checked the fax machine.,jim
10407,Did you check your... butt?,andy
10408,"Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was?  If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception.  Probably get on Pam.",michael
10410,What?,michael
10412,"Well, you know what?  I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it.  He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham!  His cappa is detated from his head!",michael
10414,"Well, you know what?  There's something wrong with you.  There is something wrong with everybody in here.  Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!",michael
10415,"There are five stages to grief, which are [glancing at computer screen] denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.  And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad.  And that's   hard.  And it's making them all angry.  And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance.  And if not acceptance, then just depression.  If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job.",michael
10416,"I am going to throw you this ball.  When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged.  Let me just start.  Let me show you how this works.   I catch the ball.  I lost Ed Truck.  And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I'm crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone.",michael
10418,"Okay, fine.  Hurry back.",michael
10420,Oh.  I would like a break.,pam
10422,Great.,pam
10424,"I think so.  I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.",pam
10426,"[on phone]  Hi, yeah.  This is Mike from the West Side Market.  Well, we get a shipment of Herr's salt and vinegar chips, and we ordered that about three weeks ago and haven't ... . yeah.  You have 'em in the warehouse.  Great.  What is my store number... six.  Wait, no.  I'll call you back. [quickly hangs up] Shut up [to Karen].",jim
10428,"[as Pam returns to conference room] Okay, we can start.  Um...",michael
10429,You waited for me?,pam
10430,"Yeah.  Pam, you're a member of this family.  So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?",michael
10431,"[grabbing ball] I got it.  When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins.  When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus.  Do I regret this?  No.  I believe his tissue has made me stronger.  I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.",dwight
10432,"Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else.",michael
10434,"[returning ball to Stanley] Oh, yes Stanley.  Come on.  Your turn, you have to go.",michael
10436,Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam.,michael
10437,"Let's see.  I had an aunt that I was really close to.  She was this amazing female boxer.  Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed.  So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.",pam
10438,"Wow.  If you wanna cry, that's okay.",michael
10440,Do you want to talk about it anymore?,michael
10443,Wait a second.  That's Weekend at Bernie's. [upset] Do you think that this is a game?,michael
10445,"All right, we're starting over.",michael
10447,You are not leaving.  No!  We are not done.,michael
10449,"Yeah.  Well, you know what?  The guy who had my job has died.  And nobody cares!  And he sat at my desk. [breaking down]",michael
10451,How do you know?,michael
10453,That that bird was dead?  Did you check its breathing?,michael
10455,"Was its heart beating, Toby?  Did you check it?  No, of course you didn't.  You're not a veterinarian.  You don't know ANYTHING! [runs out of conference room crying]",michael
10456,Michael! [following Michael downstairs] Michael.   Michael ...,dwight
10457,"[seeing bird] Oh, God!",michael
10458,[in disgust] Oh...,dwight
10459,"Oh my God!  Oh my God, come on ...",michael
10460,Poor little fella.,dwight
10461,Oh shhhh--oot!,michael
10462,He is a goner.,dwight
10463,"No, he's not.",michael
10464,Yeah.,dwight
10465,"No, he's not. [cradling bird next to face]",michael
10466,"Michael, get him away from your head!  He is covered in germs and bacteria!",dwight
10467,"Well, you can't get diseases from a bird!",michael
10469,We don't know if it's dead.,michael
10471,You want me to flush him?,dwight
10472,Attention everybody.  This will only take a second of your time.  Today at 4 p.m. we will be meeting in the parking lot to have a funeral service for this bird.,michael
10474,"Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith.  But that is what you do when things die.  You honor them.  Toby killed this bird.  And now we are going to honor it.",michael
10476,"No, no, no!  That's enough!  You know what?  This bird is dead.  He died alone.  The least you can do is be there for him now. [to Dwight] Find a box for him.",michael
10478,Nice!,jim
10480,Sounded good.,jim
10483,"It's okay.  It's okay. [pats Kelly on shoulder] Shh... yes, I know, I know. It's been a tough day, but it's good to let it show.",michael
10485,[trying to shove bird into a can] Argh... gah!,dwight
10486,What are... What are you doing?,michael
10487,"What?  No, this is about the right size.",dwight
10488,"No, God, no it's not!  What is the matter with you?  Is that the beak!?",michael
10489,"I'm sorry, I grew up on a farm.  We slaughtered a pig whenever we wanted bacon.  My grandfather was reburied in an old oil drum. [pause] It would have fit if he had given me another minute.",dwight
10490,I need a box.  I need a box.  A small box... not too confining.,dwight
10491,Is it for the bird?,pam
10492,Yeah.,dwight
10493,I have it covered. [hands Dwight a decorated box],pam
10494,"Oh, thank you.",dwight
10495,If you wanna do something for the funeral...,pam
10496,"Yes, please.",dwight
10497,Maybe you could play a song on your recorder.,pam
10498,Excellent.,dwight
10499,Do you have it with you?,pam
10500,Always. [runs off],dwight
10501,Did I wake up this morning thinking I'd be throwing together a bird funeral?  You never can tell what your day here is  gonna turn into.,pam
10503,Where'd I find what?,jim
10504,"I called the manufacturer, who referred me to distributor, who referred me to the vending machine company, who told me that they sell them in the machines in the building next door.",jim
10505,Glad you could all make it.,michael
10507,"Dwight, do you have the box?",michael
10508,"Actually, I have it.",pam
10509,You made this?  Wow. [impressed] That's... that's very nice.,michael
10511,I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay.,pam
10512,Yes.,michael
10513,"What do we know about this bird?  You might think, 'Not much.  It's just a bird.'  But we do know some things.  We know it was a local bird.  Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above.",pam
10515,"And we know how he died.  Flying into the glass doors.  But you know what?  I don't think he was being stupid.  I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song.",pam
10516,He's not a songbird.,dwight
10517,Shhh.,michael
10518,"An impression, then.  Lastly, we can't help but notice that he was by himself when he died, but of course, we all know that doesn't mean he was alone.  Because I'm sure that there were lots of other birds out there who cared for him very much.  He will not be forgotten.",pam
10520,[begins playing recorder],dwight
10521,[singing] Just smile for me and let the day begin.  You are the sunshine that lights my heart within... on the wings of love ...,pam
10522,"Society teaches us that  having feelings and crying is bad and wrong. Well, that's baloney, because grief isn't wrong. There is such a thing as good grief. Just ask Charlie Brown.",michael
10523,Let's get back to work.,dwight
10525,Umm... sure.,jim
10527,[chuckles] He's so cute.,jim
10529,"That's okay. [Hannah shows pic of husband naked with baby] Oh, no, it's not. I'm sorry, is that your husband in the tub with him?",jim
10531,Sounds good.,jim
10533,"Oh, wow. He...",michael
10535,Does his family know?,michael
10537,But I'm the first in the office?,michael
10539,"Okay, yes, sure, I will do that...",michael
10541,"...'Cause I'm the first to to find out. Nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them. Well, good. How are you holding up? Want me to come over? [Jan hangs up]",michael
10542,"Ed Truck died. And it blows. They say that with grief, time makes it worse, which is bad for me because I found out before anybody so I've had more time to be sad.",michael
10543,"Attention, everyone. As you know, Ed Truck is dead. If you have any contact information on Rolodex files or in Microsoft Outlook, remove it now. Also, if you have any photographs, Pam will make her shredder available during lunch. That is all.",dwight
10544,"Remembering the dead doesn't help anybody. The way to best honor them is to figure out what killed them and prevent that thing from killing anyone ever again. In this case, some sort of steel exoskeleton to protect the neck, or else a device that allows the head to live separately from the body. I'm working on both.",dwight
10545,"I would like you all to clear your schedules this afternoon, because I am telling corporate to send in a grief counselor. We need to find out what is blocking you. And that way, we'll be able to honor Ed the way he deserves to be honored. May he rest in peace.",michael
10547,"What was that, Kevin?",michael
10549,"No, you said something, didn't you?",michael
10551,You think that's funny.,michael
10553,You are disgusting.,michael
10554,"Michael, no need to call corporate. We are supposed to use Toby. He's trained as a grief counselor.",dwight
10555,"No, that can't be right.",michael
10557,"Well, then I guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world, doesn't it?",michael
10559,Hi.,pam
10561,"Well, I will be spending the entire afternoon in grief counseling for someone I've never met.",pam
10563,"Closer to the epicenter, I guess.",pam
10567,"You're ruining it, already. They should not be given the choice.",michael
10574,"Wow. Wow. No. No. You are the most heartless, soulless person I've ever met.",michael
10576,"No. No. Shh. Enough. It is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here. Dwight, Ryan, I want you to take the table out. We're gonna go on a five minute break, and when you come back, we're going to start with a clean slate, and, in the interim, I would like you to forget everything that Toby has said, okay?",michael
10577,"I don't think I'm overstating it when I say that Toby is a plague on this company. And he is worthless. You give people a chance to shine and they blow it, just like you knew they would. Grief counseling is not about, 'Are you hungry? Would you like a sandwich?' These people are so far gone, you have to stick a food tube down their throats.",michael
10578,"Okay, part of the problem was that Toby talked at you. Now, I am going to talk with you. First off, I want you to be comfortable, because you really can't grieve if you're all tight and buttoned up. So, guys, loosen your ties, just take your jackets off if you want. Ladies, let your hair down. You know what? Even take your shoes off. I wanna get personal and I want you all to really open up. And I want you to know that anything and everything can be said.",michael
10581,"I found an exercise in Toby's binder that he managed to miss, that involves screening the part of you that says, 'I don't wanna do that. I don't wanna talk about that. That is too private.' Here's how it works. I'm going to throw you this ball.",michael
10584,Really?,pam
10586,"Wow, I thought that was supposed to be, like, next month.",pam
10588,"Yeah, I'd love to see them. Oh, and tell them I say, 'Congratulations.'",pam
10590,I should probably head back in.,pam
10592,"But, umm, thanks for the break.",pam
10594,[in his office playing with a Dunder Mifflin Truck when it drops and the 'head' of the Truck comes off],michael
10595,"Michael once told me that Home Alone is the saddest movie ever. When I asked him why, he said, 'Because the whole family forgets the kid at home. There is nothing funny about that.'",pam
10596,"That's... Hold it, hold it, hold it. Start, like, right in there. [Dwight digs hole in ground] Just dig.",michael
10597,Ow! God!,dwight
10598,"Okay, give it to me. You don't know what you're doing. All right. [Michael starts digging]",michael
10600,"Nothing. Let's just... all right. [talks to warehouse guys] Guys, do you have a box we could use?",michael
10601,Brain teaser. I have two coins totaling 15 cents and one of them is not a nickel. What are they?,dwight
10603,"No, I said one of them is not a nickel.",dwight
10605,"Ok. A man and his son get into a car accident. They are rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, there is no way I can operate on this boy, ...",dwight
10607,A man is found hanging from the ceiling...,dwight
10609,A hunter.,dwight
10611,Damn it!,dwight
10613,Uhhh... nothing.,michael
10615,"Yeah, nothing. How was your day?",michael
10617,"Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?",michael
10619,I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had sex. Is that what you want to hear?,michael
10620,"Never ever, ever sleep with your boss. I am so lucky that Jan and I only got to second base.",michael
10622,Hi.,pam
10624,"Oh, I don't know if I'm...",pam
10626,"It's weird. Jan use to treat Michael like he was a ten year old, but lately it's like he's five.",pam
10627,So you excited?,dwight
10629,Very excited?,dwight
10631,Extremely excited? ... Just very?  That's cool.,dwight
10633,"I am very excited. Ryan hasn't made a sale yet, but more importantly, he hasn't made an ally yet. Is he going to be a slacker-loser-wise-ass like Jim was? Or is he going to join the Dwight Army of Champions?",dwight
10635,"When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.",dwight
10637,What?,jim
10639,Is it?,jim
10641,"No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair.",jim
10643,So I guess I can't get up.,jim
10644,"Hey Koselli, the Kos. Cosby. Hey hey hey. I love Jello Pudding Pops. My son, Theo, loves Jello Pudding Pops too.",michael
10645,"Do you know where we are, temp?",dwight
10647,"I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it. [Ryan tries to take it, Dwight closes hand] AH! [Ryan tries again and takes seed] When... Damn it.",dwight
10648,"Hey, Big Tuna, can I talk to you for a second.",andy
10649,Sure.,jim
10650,Can you stand up? And talk to me over there?,andy
10652,I'm acting my heart out here.,andy
10654,"Yeah, really. You asked for my help, so I helped.",andy
10656,Once a year they bring in a little cart and they give away free pretzels. It's really not a big deal. To some people it is.,pam
10657,"Productivity is important but how can I be productive if I have this one little thing in my brain? That I cannot get out. And that one little thing is a soft pretzel. So I'm just going to have my soft pretzel, then I'll get to work, and I'll be super productive. Look out for me.",michael
10658,"[looks at long pretzel line] Oh, shhh... Come on.",michael
10659,"And just as you have planted your seed in the ground, I'm going to plant my seed in you.",dwight
10661,"Smells pretty bad, doesn't it?",dwight
10663,It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away.,dwight
10665,"Oh hey, I forgot something in my car.  I'll be right back.",dwight
10669,Uh huh.,michael
10671,"[Phyllis embraces Bob ahead in line] Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?",michael
10673,"No, I think you're cutting in line.",michael
10675,"No, I'm not going to settle down.",michael
10677,Get in the back please.,michael
10679,Boooooo. Thank you. [hi-five's Stanley]. That's right.,michael
10683,Congratulations resourceful salesman. You have passed the second challenge. Welcome to Schrute Farm.,dwight

10692,I don't care 'bout anything but you... what ever happened to those guys?,andy
10693,Michael.,pam
10694,"No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind.",michael
10695,Great! I thought you could use this time to authorize some checks.,pam
10696,I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel.,michael
10697,"Hey, why don't you just go up to your office, get some work done, and I'll just bring you a pretzel.",pam
10698,"Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.",michael
10699,"You know, I just think it's really important that you be productive today.",pam
10700,"Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back.",michael
10701,It is time for your next test. You have planted the beet seed. You have walked the long lonely walk of loneliness.,dwight
10703,You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test?,dwight
10705,Come on!,dwight
10707,Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.,michael
10709,Thank God.,michael
10711,"Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?",michael
10713,All right! Thank you!,michael
10714,Please be seated. [man runs behind Dwight],dwight
10716,Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground.,dwight
10718,Yes.,dwight

10720,What is the greatest danger facing Dunder Mifflin?,dwight
10722,Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide?,dwight
10724,Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?,dwight
10733,"Final question, young Ryan Howard. What is Michael Scott's greatest fear?",dwight
10735,"Wrong. He's not afraid of anything. Also, I would have accepted snakes. Fear is what it's all about. You cannot sell while undergoing fear. You need to vanquish fear! One must wrestle fear to the ground. You will now wrestle my cousin Mose.",dwight
10737,Wrestle him to the ground.,dwight
10739,Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?,dwight
10741,Where are all the animals?,dwight
10742,"Ryan, come on. I am sorry. I am sorry. Mose is sorry too. Look, he sent over a basket with eggs and some fat back bacon. And look, something he whittled.",dwight
10743,"You still mad? It's just Jim and I didn't get along, and I didn't want it to be that way again. You know, I wanted us to be a team. An unstoppable team that competed against other teams.",dwight
10745,Screwgun. The sales call!,dwight
10747,"Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal?",michael
10748,Establish time frames. Keep the phrase 'real dollars' in their head. And always keep the power in the conversation. That's why you're losing them on the cold calls. Cause you say the word please too much.,dwight
10750,"Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.",dwight
10752,Good.,dwight
10754,Right.,dwight
10756,Uh huh.,dwight
10758,Exactly. Yes.,dwight

10762,"Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you.",michael
10764,And I will be taking questions.,michael
10765,"Did you have a lot of sugar today, Michael?",pam
10767,"Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we're getting a lot done, don't you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!",michael
10769,They did not. They didn't have to say it to your face.,dwight
10771,"Not everything's a lesson, Ryan. Sometimes you just fail. It's those online paper jerks. The whole business is changing. You know what? They're going to be screwed once this whole internet fad is over. What are you doing? [Ryan throws egg at building] Oh no no no no! Ryan! Yes! Ryan the temp! Come on! Courtesy of Dunder Mifflin. Come on! Drive.",dwight

10779,20 past 5.,pam
10780,AM or PM?,michael

10812,How many words per minute does the average person type?,jim
10813,I type 90.,pam

10830,Yeah.,jim
10831,That movie is so scary!,pam
10832,I know!,jim
10833,But I'm holding on because I keep waiting for Sandra Bullock to show up.,pam
10834,No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?,jim
10835,Because I got it at Blockbuster and they don't put the pictures on the box.,pam
10836,"No, you're making this up!",jim
10837,Would I make that up?,pam
10838,"Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.",jim

10882,Don't you realize the key is inside you? [pretends to pull key out of Ryan's ear],dwight
10884,"No, but seriously, your ears are the key. 90% of a good sales call is listening, only 10% is talking.",dwight
10886,Get in the car. [Ryan knocks the car door] Get... get in the car.,dwight
10887,Sales is not all in here. [wails arms] It's also in here.,dwight

10896,Yeah.,pam

To understand me, you have to know that I work in the city, but I live here on this small, beautiful farm. It's a family farm. Many Schrutes were born here and many of us end up here. My grandfather was a good man who did some very bad things. What the... Damn it! Those kids! [discovers two teenagers naked, running] You! You, get out of here! This is not a cheap motel! This is a farm and cemetery! Freaks! You're lucky I don't have my crossbow! Let me show you the compost pile.",dwight

10909,I saw the movie. I just don't know every line from the film.,jim
10910,"Seriously, you guys, ask me.",andy
10912,"Let's just say, me and Jennifer Grey probably would've broken a few laws.",andy
10914,"Nice dress, Ryan.",michael
10916,[laughing] OK.,michael
10917,"Tonight, one of our most ethnic co-workers, Kelly, has invited us all to a Diwali celebration put on by her community. What is Diwali, you may ask? Well, to have Kelly explain it [girly voice] it's ada blah blah blah, it's so super fun and it's going to be great. [normal voice] Lot of gods with unpronounceable names. Twenty minutes later you find out that is essentially a Hindu Halloween.",michael
10919,Really you do. I love the material.,pam
10921,How come you didn't get me one?,michael
10924,I actually might not go. Feeling kind of tired.,pam
10926,"Oh, I don't know. I haven't decided yet.",pam
10928,"I just feel kind of tired, you know.",pam
10929,Maybe you've got mono.,dwight
10930,Maybe. I just ...I don't really have anyone to go with.,pam
10932,"Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available.",dwight
10937,Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.,michael
10938,"It's important that this company celebrates its diversity. And you know what, Stanley? Come Kwanzaa time, I have got you covered, baby.",michael
10940,Wha? Really? You should! It's fun.,michael
10941,"I love the people here. And if there was one thing I di... don't really care for is that they can be terribly, terribly ignorant about other cultures. And I don't want them embarrassing me in front of my girlfriend, Carol.",michael
10942,"Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on.",michael
10944,Kelly?,michael
10946,Um... why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.,michael
10952,"Pam wishes. [generalized laughing] Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil...",dwight
10953,"All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'.",michael
10954,Sorry.,jim
10955,"I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.",jim
10957,Thank you.,jim
10958,"Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world.  Here are some famous Indians. [slide show] Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Village', 'Unbreakable', 'Sixth Sense', 'Sig... '",michael
10959,I see dead people.,dwight

10966,"We have such a roller coaster thing, Karen and I.",andy
10967,Scuse me?,jim
10968,Roller-coastery friendship. Hot. Cold. On again. Off again. Sexual tension filled type of deal. It's very Sam and Diane.,andy
10969,Wow.,jim
10970,From 'Cheers'.,andy
10971,Yup.,jim
10972,And another thing about the Indian people... they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before?,michael
10976,"Thank you, Kevin.",michael
10978,"Well, I find it beautiful.",michael
10980,No...,michael
10982,"No, You're not going to collect them.",michael
10984,"No. This is delightful, charming culture.",michael
10985,My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It's just sex. People... everybody does it. I'm doing it... with Carol! Probably tonight.,michael
10990,"Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.",jim
10991,You guys ready to party?,andy
10992,What's that?,jim
10993,I said are you ready TO PARTY!,andy
10998,[points at woman] What does that look like to you?,michael

11007,"Oh, yuck. [spits out food]",michael
11009,No. These s'mores are disgusting.,michael
11011,Do you think they have any s'mores?,michael
11012,"All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been?",michael
11020,Very official.,pam
11021,"I decided to come. Uh... I feel a little under-dressed... but at least I'm not dressed like a slutty cheerleader, right? Is that mean?",pam
11022,Temp! Temp! Pflut! Pflut!,dwight
11027,"Hey, Big Tuna, you ready?",andy
11028,Yep.,jim
11029,One. Two. Three. Shot!,andy

11031,"Oh, that burns! Golly. Um...",andy
11032,Good.,jim
11035,"Wow, thirty years? And you two only met once before the wedding night?",michael
11037,Wow.,michael
11039,"Oh! She's not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um... no, we're not married... yet!",michael
11041,"She is. Very fair and very kind. So... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. It's still very cool. Ok. Thanks!",michael
11042,One. Two. Three. Shot!,andy
11043,Oh.,jim
11045,"I'm going to be. [to DJ] Hi, I'm just going to get this for a sec... just a sec. [speaks in microphone] Um... everyone? I'm sorry, could I have your attention, please. Thank you. Ah-hah... Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um... okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking 'who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?' Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband.",michael
11048,What do you say?,michael
11050,I didn't hear you. [laughs],michael
11052,"[lowers microphone] Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Okay.",michael
11053,No. I get it. I get it. You're not ready. We'll wait. This is a classic...,michael
11055,"Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much.",michael
11057,Yes.,michael
11059,"Ok. Okay. Good night. [louder] Hey, you know what? Why don't I come with you. Cause I've got this book called the Kama Sutra.",michael
11061,All right. Good night.,michael
11068,Can you believe my boss proposed to his girlfriend in public? That is so Michael.,pam
11070,"Yeah. Hey, would you excuse me for a second?",pam
11071,It's hot in there. How's the naan?,pam

11091,Oh. You waiting for a call?,michael
11092,Uh... no.,pam
11093,"Wow. Pam. When Carol said 'No.' tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements.",michael

11095,"I was in that marriage arena, though.",michael
11096,Yeah.,pam
11097,Yeah. Uuuuh... well.,michael

11117,"No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right.",jim
11119,So good.,jim
11121,These are not my shoes. This is just like that show 'Taxi Cab Confessions'.,michael
11122,You say one more word; I'm stopping the car.,pam
11123,Sorry.,michael
11124,"This is going out to Indians everywhere. It's a tribute to one of the greats... Mr. Adam Sandler. [sings] Diwali is a festival of lights. Let me tell you something. Tonight has been one crazy night. So put on your saris, it's time to celebrate Diwali. Everybody looks so jolly. But it's not Christmas, it's Diwali. The goddess of destruction Kali stopped by to celebrate Diwali. Don't invite any zombies to a celebration of Diwali. Along came Polly to have some fun at Diwali. If you're Indian and you love to party, have a  happy, happy, happy, happy Diwali. Happy Diwali!",michael
11126,How do I explain this to Jan?,michael
11128,"Oh, please, stop talking. Three words or less.",michael

11134,"Well, I was letting everybody go to the big Diwali party.",michael
11136,What is Diwali?,michael
11138,"You don't know what Diwali is? Wow, Jan. I'm surprised. It's the Hindu festival of lights. I just assumed you'd be familiar with it. It's the most sacred and honored Hindu holiday in the world. It's like Christmas, Easter, and Halloween---",michael
11140,---rolled into one.,michael
11142,"I bet you're not even aware that our own Kelly Kapoor, who works in...",michael

11160,"Yeah, you should see her naked.",michael
11161,"I had promised Carol a romantic evening on the town. Um, I wanted to take her on this spooky hay ride thing, but it was like seventy dollars a person, and she's allergic to hay. So I said, 'Pop a Claritin, and I will spot you the seventy bucks,' and she's like 'I don't like to borrow money or take unnecessary medication.'  And I'm like, 'Well you're really not gonna like what I slipped in your drink last night.' And she's like, 'What the hell are you talking about?' And I'm like, 'I'm kidding. I didn't put a roof...'

11179,He does? What does he say.,dwight
11181,"At Cornell, in my fraternity, my house name was 'Hubble' because I was so good at finding a party. I was like a powerful space telescope, so... Freshman year, when my skin was still really bad, they called me El Guapo.",andy

11183,"Nope, I got eel.",jim
11184,[speechless],andy
11186,Didn't see that coming.,andy
11187,"And perhaps the most important person to Indian culture, Sir Ben Kingsley. Because of him, the British left India, and then he became an actor like Ronald Reagan.",michael

11189,Yeah?,michael
11190,Your shirt is buttoned wrong.,pam
11191,"So, any questions?",michael
11193,Hey.,jim
11195,"Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain.",jim
11196,"I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future.

11218,Well...,michael
11220,"Oh, you gotta be... Josh?",michael
11222,"Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?",michael
11223,"It is an outrage, that's all. It's... hey're making a huge, huge mistake. Let's see Josh replace these people. Let's see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they don't. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm.",michael
11224,Pictures. Memories. [Picks up a framed photo of Stanley's daughter from Stanley's desk] Look at that. They grow up so fast.,michael
11225,Hey stranger.,dwight
11226,Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please.,michael
11227,Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.,dwight
11228,"Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can.",michael
11229,"When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, 'Something Weird is Going On.' Colon, 'What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute.'",dwight

11257,"[surrounded by clapping coworkers] Stamford, Connecticut! Stamford, Connecticut!",andy
11258,"I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.",jim
11260,"It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, 'Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.' So, maybe that'll stop now.",pam

11271,Awesome.,michael
11272,This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.,michael
11273,"All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there. [Looks at  Dwight] Let's go.",michael
11274,Yes!,dwight
11275,"Oh, good... you're bringing Dwight.",pam
11276,Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.,michael

11293,"I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?",jim
11295,"Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?",jim
11297,What does that mean?,jim
11303,"Okay, this is it. [runs up the stairs of CFO's house, with Dwight] This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like 'Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person.' It's very dramatic.  Although, I can't say I was a big fan of  'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't. It was something else.",michael
11317,"Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.",jim
11318,"So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up?",dwight
11319,I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.,michael
11320,"No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice.",dwight
11321,All right.,michael
11322,"[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work.",dwight
11324,Yes? What is the meaning of this?,dwight
11325,Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?,michael
11326,"Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents.",dwight
11327,"Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.",michael
11328,"Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business.",dwight
11329,"[no longer talking to Dwight as Wallace] Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that.",michael
11330,"[as himself] Whoa hey, why not?",dwight
11331,"Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?",michael
11332,Okay.,dwight
11333,Don't touch me this time.,michael

11338,Wow.,jim
11340,Thank you.,jim

11344,"No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think.",jim
11346,Okay.,jim
11359,"Ah. [takes a gulp of Gatorade and passes the bottle to Michael] Here, replinish your fluids.",dwight
11360,[takes bottle and cleans off cap with his tie],michael
11362,He's not here. I don't know where he is.,pam

11373,Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?,pam
11375,[referring to Michael's ringing phone] who is it?,dwight
11376,The office.,michael
11377,Gonna get it?,dwight
11378,"No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news.",michael
11379,I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.,pam
11381,"That's, um... I hadn't thought about it, huh.",pam
11383,"Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right?",pam
11387,I really don't know.  How you doing with all this?,jim
11389,You'd actually move to Scranton?,jim
11391,New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York?,jim

11396,"Thanks, man. You, too. Totally.",andy
11397,Anything?,michael
11398,Nothing. [puts down binoculars],dwight
11399,What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under?,michael
11400,Then it was an honor to have worked with you.,dwight
11401,"[pats Dwight and sighs] All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.",michael
11402,My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.,dwight

11405,"Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good.",michael
11406,What were your favorite moments?,dwight
11407,"Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one.",michael

11423,Okay.,pam
11425,Yeah.,pam
11427,"Yeah, me too.",pam
11428,"Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.",pam

11444,"Yeah, baby!",michael
11445,In your face!,dwight
11446,We did it!,michael
11447,"Oh, man.",dwight
11448,How did we do it?,michael
11449,I don't ... have no idea.,dwight
11450,I don't understand.,michael
11452,The Stamford branch is closing and everybody's just packing up their stuff. Andy Bernard made these tasteful hats.,jim
11453,"[to office worker] That's the other thing you got to watch out...  [to Jim] Yo! Tuna! I wanna talk to you about this new boss, Michael Scott.",andy
11454,Yeah.,jim
11455,So what's he like? Likes? Dislikes? Favorite sports? Favorite movies? Favorite men's magazines?,andy
11456,You know what? I think you just need to meet him.,jim
11457,"Playing your cards close to the vest. I get it. Good luck over there, Tuna. Cross me and I will destroy you.",andy
11458,Sounds good Andy.,jim
11460,"Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later?",jim
11462,What?,andy
11463,Hey!,pam
11465,How'd the run go?,pam
11467,That's great!,pam
11468,"Psh, why is that great?",dwight
11469,Because he accomplished something.,pam
11470,What was your mile time?,dwight
11472,[scoffs] I could beat that on a skateboard.,dwight
11474,"Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time.",dwight
11475,"Really, Dwight? How fast are you?",pam
11476,Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.,dwight
11477,Really?,pam
11478,I am fast. To give you a reference point. I'm somewhere between a snake and a mongoose. And a panther.,dwight
11479,"Man, what is taking Toby so long?",dwight
11480,"Oh, I'll just time him later.",pam
11481,And you'll compare the times?,dwight
11482,Yeah. Are you ready?,pam
11483,"No, my groin...",dwight
11484,Set,pam
11485,...is really tight.,dwight
11486,Go!,pam
11487,I can't... [starts running],dwight
11488,"Am I being mean to Dwight? I don't know. I did just make him run around the building and I have no intention of timing him. This isn't even a stopwatch. It's a digital thermometer. He does make my life harder, sometimes. And on purpose. Like he tried to put meters on the bathroom stalls as a way of bringing in more money for the company. [yells to Dwight] Hey, three more laps to go. Gotta pick it up if you're going to beat Toby.",pam
11489,Aaaaah!,dwight
11490,I should probably get back to work.,pam
11491,Here... Who's here?,michael
11492,Nametag?,dwight
11493,"Yes, please.",michael
11494,Karen Filippelli.,dwight
11495,Karen Filip... [In Italian voice] Ka-ren Fili-pell-li.,michael
11496,Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino.,dwight
11497,Okay.,michael
11498,"My branch is absorbing the Stamford branch. Or, as I like to put it, my family is doubling in size. That's all I'm going to say about it because I have a gigantic performance ahead of me. And I have to get into my head and focus. [exhales]",michael
11499,Who's next?,michael
11500,That's Andy Bernard.,dwight
11501,Andy Bernard.,michael
11502,If I were you...,dwight
11503,Saint Bernard.,michael
11504,...I would fire Anthony Gardner...,dwight
11505,What?,michael
11506,...before noon...,dwight
11507,I'm not...,michael
11508,...to consolidate power.,dwight
11509,I'm not firing somebody on the first day.,michael
11510,"No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner.",dwight
11511,The Japanese camp guards of World War II always chose one man to kill whenever a batch of new prisoners arrived. I always wondered how they chose the man who was to die. I think I would have been good at choosing the person.,dwight
11512,Good morning!,pam
11513,"Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league.",michael
11514,Okay.,pam
11515,"Yes! I'm in a good mood today! I'm excited to meet all the new people and to see my old friend again, definitely. That's always a thing that makes people happy... to have an old friend back.",pam
11517,Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr.,michael
11518,Hannah Smoterich-Barr.,dwight
11519,Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.,michael
11520,"You know for a lot of these people this is the only family they have. So...  As far as I'm concerned, [holds up WORLD'S BEST BOSS mug] this says 'World's Best Dad'.",michael
11521,Ah! There he is Tony... what's your last name?,michael
11523,Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag... for you. [laughs] Okay.,michael
11526,"Well, they're just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later.",michael
11528,"Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton. [to Tony] All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.",michael
11531,Hi!,pam
11533,I'm Pam.,pam
11535,"Oh, thanks. My Mom made it for me.",pam
11537,Welcome.,michael
11539,"Welcome, welcome, welcome! [in robot voice] Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader.",michael
11541,"Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh?",michael
11542,"I'll be the Number Two guy here in Scranton in six weeks. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and never breaking off a handshake. I'm always thinking one step ahead. Like a carpenter that makes stairs.",andy
11543,Hello.,andy
11544,Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome!,michael
11545,And you must be Michael Scott. Aloha and... hello.,andy
11546,"A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.",michael
11547,"Michael, thank you for welcoming me to your little kingdom, Mike.",andy
11548,Oh.,michael
11549,Nifty!,andy
11550,They are nifty! They're nifty gifties.,michael
11551,You know who I really like? Is this guy Andy Bernard. He has got this very likable way about him.,michael
11553,Right.,jim
11554,"[to Jim] No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man.",michael
11555,Okay.,jim
11556,"[to Martin] How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you.",michael
11558,"Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work. [shakes head] Not... so, your desk is...",michael
11559,"Hi, I'm Jim. I'm new here.",jim
11560,Oh my god! It's really you!,pam
11561,"Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met...",jim
11562,I know. I don't care.,pam
11563,Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.,jim
11564,It's really good to see you.,pam
11565,"You, too.",jim
11566,"Where do I stand with Pam? Um... no idea. I mean, we're friends. Always have been friends. Um... .that is where we stand.",jim
11567,"Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in from Stamford.",dwight
11568,"Hey, Dwight.",jim
11569,Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.,dwight
11570,Okay. Sounds good.,jim
11571,What are you doing?,dwight
11572,I don't know what you're talking about.,jim
11573,I have a smudge on my forehead?,dwight
11574,No. Looks good.,jim
11575,Why are you looking at my forehead?,dwight
11576,I'm not.,jim
11577,"Meet my eye line, Jim!",dwight
11578,I am.,jim
11579,Stop acting like an idiot!,dwight
11580,Okay.,jim
11582,Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.,jim
11584,"Oh, I'm sorry. Are you sitting here now?",jim
11586,Oh.,jim
11588,"You know, man, it's really you're call.",jim
11590,[whispers] Let me get that for you.,jim
11592,This one taken? No. Good.,jim
11597,"Michael Scott. Thank you. I appreciate it, Mike.",andy
11598,Right.,michael
11599,Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.,dwight
11600,Andy Bernard. Regional Director in Charge of Sales.,andy
11601,"So you'll be reporting to me, then.",dwight
11602,"Umm, on the contrary.",andy
11603,My title has 'Manager' in it.,dwight
11604,And I'm a director.,andy
11605,Oh.,dwight
11606,Which on a film set is the highest title there is. Do you know anything about film?,andy
11607,I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them.,dwight
11608,Congratulations.,andy
11609,"Hey, Toby!",jim
11611,"How are you, man?",jim
11613,I just wanted to say hi.,jim
11615,Oh. Is that like your new thing?,jim
11617,No. It's cool.,jim
11619,All right. Good to be back.,jim
11621,All right.,jim
11623,No problem.,jim
11625,[off camera] ...what?,jim
11628,[talking to himself] I present the orientation video.,michael
11629,We need to talk!,dwight
11630,Not now.,michael
11631,Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales?,dwight
11632,I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.,michael
11633,Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy?,dwight
11634,"It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.",michael
11635,Ok. Who reports to who?,dwight
11636,"I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?",michael
11637,And then if I want...,dwight
11638,Work it out amongst your selves!,michael
11639,I...,dwight
11640,"Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company?",michael
11641,I...,dwight
11642,Will you?,michael
11643,One...,dwight
11644,Please?,michael
11646,Kelly!,jim
11648,Really?,jim
11650,Great. What's new with you?,jim
11652,"Okay. Everybody settled in? Good. Why don't we all proceed in to the conference room? Or, should I say, the banquet hall. For... drum roll, please [makes drum roll noises], the official Merger Day All-Family Welcome Breakfast. Come on in!",michael
11653,Yoko shack.,michael
11656,"Nope, no. Guests only.",michael
11658,"Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo.",michael
11660,"Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.",michael
11662,"No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please. [talks to group] Welcome. Help yourself.",michael
11664,"Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation.[talks to group] Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.",michael
11665,"Oh, this looks promising.",jim
11666,You won't be disappointed.,pam
11667,Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch 'Lazy Scranton'.,michael
11669,"Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'.",michael
11670,"Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.",dwight
11671,So check out how we live,michael
11673,They call it Scranton.,michael
11674,What?,dwight
11675,The Electric City. Scranton.,michael
11676,What?,dwight
11677,The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider.,michael
11678,But check that it's covered by your health care provider!,dwight
11679,It reminds me of the orientation video showed on my first day. 'The Scranton Witch Project'.,jim
11680,[in video] I am so scared... when people don't label their personal food.,michael
11682,"You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,",michael
11683,But the little cars go in the compact spot,dwight
11685,[on video in background] Spot. Scranton. What? The Electric City. Scranton.What? The Electric City. Scranton. What?,michael
11686,"Well, so far, I think it is killin'. I thought it would either be an 'A' or an 'A+' but I completely forgot that there's an 'A++'.",michael
11688,Terrible. Totally unconvincing.,jim
11690,"Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.",jim
11692,You feel good?,jim
11694,All right.,jim
11696,"Hey, buddy. Anything new to report?",andy
11697,Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works.,dwight
11698,"Sure thing, buddy.",andy
11699,"Am I trying to get under his skin? Yes. Because the angrier he gets, the more marginalized he becomes. Meanwhile, Andy Bernard is out there layin' on the charm.",andy
11700,"Hey, Angela. Check this out. It's my new screen saver.",andy
11702,Do you like it?,andy
11704,Thank you. You have such a pretty smile by the way.,andy
11706,You're welcome.,andy
11707,Hey.,pam
11708,Hey!,jim
11709,What happened to grape soda?,pam
11710,Oh yeah. I'm trying to move away from that. Getting into more of a bottled water phase.,jim
11711,Oh. You've changed so much.,pam
11712,"Well, I'm evolving, Pam.",jim
11713,So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?,pam
11714,"Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.",jim
11715,"Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever.",pam
11716,Okay.,jim
11717,Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I...,michael
11718,Nope. You're not interrupting anything. Nope. I'm...,jim
11719,All right.,michael
11720,Don't...,jim
11721,Okay.,michael
11722,All right. [to Pam] I should probably get back to work. Get back to work.,jim
11723,"Yeah. I know, me too.",pam
11724,All right!,jim
11725,"The day's going fine. It's been a little chaotic but it's fine. It's great! A lot of distractions. But, it's good.",pam
11730,What is that? A squid's eye or...,michael
11732,How did you...,michael
11747,People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences?  A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.,michael
11748,"I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. There's supposed to be music and it's... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just.",michael
11749,Do you have batteries?,dwight
11750,Ssshh stupid! Um...,michael
11751,[sings drum beat intro to 'What is Love?'],andy
11752,That's it!,michael
11753,[sings] What is love?,andy
11754,"Yes, yes! Okay!",michael
11755,"Baby, don't hurt me.",andy
11756,"Okay, here we go.",michael
11758,Oh!,michael
11759,"Baby, don't hurt me!",andy
11760,Oh! Oh! Oh!,michael
11761,Whoa-oh-oh-oh,andy
11762,Scuse me! Scuse me!,michael
11764,You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow!,michael
11765,Whoa-oh-oh-oh.,andy
11766,"You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy!",michael
11767,"Oh, probably because of all the nose candy.",andy
11768,"[laughs hysterically] Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor.",michael
11769,"Very funny, Michael!",dwight
11770,Okay! Okay!,michael
11771,"Really funny, Michael!",dwight
11772,"All right, all right, I'm on a roll.",michael
11773,Why are the new people on the table? To show them that we are not above them.,michael
11775,Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would.,michael
11777,I understand. We're all friends.,michael
11779,"Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.",michael
11781,You know what? I'll help. I will...,michael
11783,Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this!,michael
11784,Do this. Come on. Ready?,dwight
11785,Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up.,michael
11786,On three. One... two... three.,dwight
11787,"Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I'm under this... I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here.",michael
11789,We've almost got it. Push it! Push it!,michael
11791,I'm right in your crack!,michael
11793,Up and over.,michael
11795,Up and over.,michael
11797,You've got it.,michael
11799,"You've got it, you've got it.",michael
11801,Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay.,michael
11802,"Hey, hey. Easy.",dwight
11803,Easy.,michael
11805,Don't...,michael
11807,What...,michael
11809,I don't understand.,michael
11811,"Well, we'll squeeze you in.",michael
11813,"You can't quit! On the first day. That's [deep voice] heresy, my friend! [regular voice] Okay, let's talk about this. What happened? I mean, what... Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause he's... what?",michael
11815,My management style? So... didn't you think 'Lazy Scranton' was funny?,michael
11817,"Okay. Well, don't bother quitting because you're fired.",michael
11819,"You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!",michael
11821,"Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.",michael
11822,That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.,dwight
11823,"Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.",michael
11824,And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice? [whispers] Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.,dwight
11825,Dwight may have won the battle. But I will win... the next battle.,andy
11828,"Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.",michael
11830,No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.,michael
11831,"The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it.",michael
11832,"Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.",michael
11833,What!,dwight
11834,Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on!,michael
11836,Does he ever.,jim
11837,"Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators.",michael
11838,YEAH!,dwight
11839,Yeah.,michael
11841,"Go home, Toby. Just...",michael
11843,Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful. [reads note] 'You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!',michael
11845,"No. No, no, no. No.  You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh...",michael
11848,THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!,michael
11857,"See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most. [answers phone] Jell-o!",michael
11859,"Hi, Jan!",michael
11861,I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.,michael
11863,Yes.,michael
11865,But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.,michael
11867,What?,michael
11869,"Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos.",michael
11870,"So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two.",michael
11871,If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.,dwight
11872,"Yeah, it does, actually.",jim
11873,So who will be your new Number Three?,dwight
11874,Uh... that I have not decided yet.,michael
11875,"Michael, I would just like to say you have handled this entire situation with great aplomb.",andy
11876,"Thank you, Andy. That's... very kind. Thanks.",michael
11877,And I have to say your leadership...,dwight
11878,Shut it...,michael
11879,has brought...,dwight
11880,Shut it! That's... [whispers to camera] suck up!,michael
11881,"[talking on cellphone] Hey! Where you at, Filippelli?",jim
11883,[laughs] What's wrong? You didn't have a good first day?,jim
11885,Yeah. Sure. Sounds good. I... . [sees Pam in rearview mirror] Hey! You know what? Can I give you a call right back?,jim
11887,"Ok, thanks.",jim
11889,Hey.,jim
11890,Hey!,pam
11891,I thought you had already... left.,jim
11892,Uh... no. I just uh had some other stuff I had to do.,pam
11893,Oh... Good.,jim
11894,What's up?,pam
11895,"Oh, nothing. I just feel bad. I feel like things were a little weird today... or something.",jim
11896,What do you mean?,pam
11897,I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh...,jim
11898,Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want.,pam
11899,O..ok. Um..good.,jim
11900,We're friends. We'll always be friends.,pam
11901,Right.,jim
11902,It's good to have you back.,pam
11903,Yeah. Good to be back.,jim
11906,"Saw your dorkmobile in the parking lot. What does it get, like four miles to the gallon?",andy
11907,"Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.",dwight
11908,"Yeah, my Xterra's pretty sweet. Luxurious, yet rugged. Leave it to the Japanese.",andy
11909,Xterra's not even a real word.,dwight
11910,"Actually, it is. It's Latin for 'earth.'",andy
11911,"Oh, so you drive an X-Earth?",dwight
11912,Yeah.,andy
11913,That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.,dwight
11914,"Yeah, I bet you would. Oh, by the way, 1985 called. It wants its car back.",andy
11915,Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.,dwight

12245,"He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.",dwight

12337,"No, I get it, of course. OK. [holds out hand for folder. Jim gives Pam back the folder.]",pam
12338,"I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?",jim
12339,I'd like everybody's attention. Christmas is canceled.,michael
12341,Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year's.,michael
12343,"Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley.",michael
12344,"Michael, what's going on?",pam
12345,Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.,michael
12346,Will they still air 'Rudolph?',jim
12348,[over everybody else's talking] Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?,dwight
12349,Fine! [everybody stops talking] Have your party. Just no guests.,michael
12351,"Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.",michael
12352,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts.",michael
12353,I know.,pam
12354,It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.,michael
12355,"OK, well, why are you laying like that?",pam
12356,[moves a little] Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?,michael
12357,Like what?,pam
12358,"Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?",michael
12359,"Well.. um I, I don't...",pam
12360,And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to?,michael
12361,I don't need to know.,pam
12362,"Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short.",dwight
12363,Take it from Toby.,michael
12364,Copy.,dwight
12365,"Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me?",michael
12366,"No, thank you.",pam
12367,It's all... [Pam walks away.] OK.,michael
12383,What are you doing? ['Goodbye My Lover' by James Blunt plays],michael
12384,[putting things into a box] We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.,dwight
12385,"Hey, what's the haps? [Dwight shuts door in his face.]",andy
12386,Carol?,michael
12387,"Oh, look at this. [looks through papers] Your old condo closing papers. It's riddled with Carol's name. I wish I could throw this in the box. [Michael hits repeat to 'Goodbye My Lover' on computer]",dwight
12388,Why don't you just buy the whole song?,dwight
12389,I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it.,michael
12390,"Oh, look at this, she saved you two thousand dollars 'cause they failed to report a mold problem. [Continues to sift through papers] But wouldn't that affect the final... How did she? Oh, oh, I see what she did. That is good. Wow. Carol is one smart cookie.",dwight
12391,[singing] Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend. [hits repeat again],michael
12392,"This is an old adage, but they say when you find true love, you know within the first 24 hours. With Carol, I knew within the first 24 minutes of the second day I met her.",michael
12393,"I feel like I've been kinda cold to Karen and there's no real reason for it. I mean it's not like she's ever done anything to me. So, I think I probably shouldn't be cold to her.",pam
12394,"Hey, Karen. Sorry about that meeting today, that was really crazy.",pam
12396,"Um, usually like that.",pam
12398,I think one of her cats did once. She came in with scratches all over her face. [both laugh],pam
12400,"Um, I really liked your karaoke idea.",pam
12402,That could really be fun.,pam
12404,You guys do a raffle?,pam
12411,There is now. We just started it.,pam
12415,What's ours again?,pam
12417,Oh right.,pam
12424,"Right, and if you're interested in the way more fun party, all the info can be found here on our more brightly colored flyer. [Angela rips down brightly colored flyer and walks away. Karen rips down Angela's flyer.]",pam
12426,"Yup, looks like the Scranton people and the Stamford people are finally coming together. And that's what you want, right?",jim
12428,Pam and Karen. I am ordering you to cease and desist all party planning. Immediately.,dwight
12429,You can't do that.,pam
12430,"As ranking number three in this office, I am order -",dwight
12431,Umm... I'm number three.,andy
12432,You're number four.,dwight

12435,"OK, I think I can help here.",jim
12436,"Ok, good",dwight
12437,"As ranking number two, I am starting a committee to determine the validity of the two committees and I am the sole member. The committee will act on this now.",jim
12438,"OK, this is stupid.",dwight
12439,Could you please keep it down? [interrupted Dwight] I'm in session. I've determined that this committee is valid. [Pam and Karen cheer.],jim
12440,"No no, no, wait, wait, wait [raises hand] Permission to join the Validity Committee.",dwight
12441,Permission denied.,jim
12442,Damn it!,dwight
12443,"Hey. I can't concentrate when I know you're in pain, man. Let me take you to lunch. [Michael sighs.] C'mon, my treat.",andy
12444,All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway.,michael
12445,"That's my boy. I know the perfect place, too.",andy
12446,Hooters?,michael
12447,"No. Benihana. Much classier. But don't worry, the babes are totally hot, too. [do a fist bump and explosion]",andy
12448,"Ah, I need my entourage [both exit Michael's office] Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C'mon, we're going to Asian Hooters.",michael
12450,Why not?,michael
12452,"Ok, feel better.",michael
12454,"C'mon Jim, let's go.",michael
12455,"OK. [to Ryan] Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.",jim
12457,Bros before hos. Why? Because your bros are always there for you. They have got your back after your ho rips your heart out for no good reason. And you were nothing but great to your ho and you told her she was the only ho for you. And that she was better than all the other hos in the world. And then ... and then suddenly she's not yo' ho no mo'.,michael
12458,"So she looks really hot, so I said, 'You look hotter than usual today.' [to waitress] Thank you. Michael [gesturing to sit down.] Head of the table.",andy
12459,"Get out Jim. [Dwight tries to sit between Andy and Jim] Actually, um... [to two other people at the table] Sir, I'm going to need take this chair.",dwight

12462,Yes.,jim
12463,I can't... I can't here what you're saying.,dwight
12464,Carol used to drink lattes.,michael
12465,[off screen at other end of table] What're you talking about?,dwight
12466,She would get this little foam mustache...,michael
12467,[still off screen] Carol had a mustache?,dwight
12468,"And I used to say 'Hey, got latte?' And she'd say, that's not funny.",michael
12469,[off screen] What are you guys talking about?,dwight
12470,She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh to enjoy ---,michael
12471,Michael! Repeat what you said louder!,dwight
12472,It is my job to be there for Michael. How can I be there for Michael if I'm here for Michael? [food is thrown at Dwight's face],dwight
12473,"I'm already starting to forget what color eyes she had. I can't, OK, I'm gonna call her. I am gonna call and find out...",michael
12474,No.,andy
12475,Who are you calling?,dwight
12476,I'm just gonna call her.,michael
12477,"Put that away. Put that away. S.O.S. We... I... May day. Haha. Man down over here, [to waitress] we need your help.",andy
12479,I think we'll start with a round of noga-sakes. [waitress gives confused look],andy
12480,"One part eggnog, three parts sake. Some places won't make it for you though, because eggnog is seasonal.",andy
12482,That's a great idea.,pam
12485,You can have your snack in here.,pam
12491,"If you're using more than three pieces of tape to wrap a present, you're doing it wrong.",pam
12493,"Oh, I just get those at any party supply place.",pam
12495,"Oh yeah, your mom would love that.",pam
12497,Bye.,pam
12499,"Oh, yeah... Maybe.",pam
12500,Looks like you've got a little Nakiri knife action going there.,dwight
12502,"Yeah, I bet you wish you had a Nakiri, though.",dwight
12504,"Nah, I don't know... Still think Nakiri's better.",dwight
12506,Nothing he's doing is cheering me up.,michael
12507,"Wait for the onion. Trust me. Hey Cindy, he just had his heart broken, you wouldn't do that to him, would you?",andy
12509,"Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour. [Cindy laughs and walks away]",michael
12510,"You made her laugh. Yes! She totally digs us. [referring to what chef is doing] Watch, watch, watch, watch. [Onions smoke up] Heh, heh? What did I tell 'ya?",andy
12511,You're right. That's good.,michael
12512,Hello everyone. We would just like to announce that our party is starting now in the break room. So... you can come by... .,pam
12515,"Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael! [waves down Michael with a napkin and whistles to get attention]",dwight
12516,This drink... [in audible conversation with Michael],andy
12517,I don't know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party.,michael
12519,[with conviction] Start the party.,dwight
12521,Our party is also starting now [opens door to break room.],pam
12524,Good choice. [Kelly drags Ryan to the break room.],pam
12531,We have vodka!,pam
12537,I got goose bumps.,pam
12539,"Ahh, damn this chicken is good. My compliments to the chef. [points to chef] Which is you! Right? Hahahaha. Awesome! I need some meat. I want some steak. [leans over to neighboring man's plate] I see steak.",michael
12541,"Excuse me [tries to take away meat with chopsticks] Ah, un guard. [Fights with chopsticks and laughs] Family style.",michael
12542,"No, it's not.",jim
12543,"Cindy, Cindy.",andy
12544,I don't think... I love it!,michael
12545,"I want you to close your eyes and imagine your dream house. [Cindy laughs] C'mon, do it for Michael. He's had a really long day.",andy
12546,[laughing] I don't know what he's doing.,michael
12547,This is great.,andy
12548,Jim! Jim! What... What's happening?,dwight
12549,"Oh, [points to Cindy] she's asleep.",jim
12550,Oh... Narcolepsy.,dwight
12551,Probably.,jim
12552,Now open your eyes and describe it to me.,andy
12554,"Oh my gosh, now she's up.",dwight
12555,"And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it.",jim
12556,"Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood. [Cindy looks confused. Woman next to Dwight is disgusted] Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers.",dwight
12557,"Oh no, this is different. The CIA thing, that was a prank on Dwight. This is more like a umm... OK, it's pretty much the same thing.",jim
12564,What?,pam
12582,"[referring to waitresses] They have been checking us out, all night! I am not kidding!",andy
12583,You know what we should do?,michael
12584,What?,andy
12585,We should invite them to the Christmas party.,michael
12586,"Now, you are thinking. Yes. And you know what? Because you have had such a rough day, you get Cindy.",andy
12587,"Oh, you are such mench my friend. [They stand up and do fist bump and explosion]",michael
12588,"OK, where is everybody? I would like them to meet my new girlfriend. [Guys walk in with two different waitresses from Benihana's]",michael
12589,"I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too.",jim
12590,The least I could do was give some poor sick kid a bike.,michael
12592,"Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, it's yours.",michael
12594,Oh. [She whispers in his ear. Michael starts to laugh] That's what she said.,michael
12595,Hello? I would like everybody to meet my new girlfriend.,michael
12596,My new girlfriend.,andy

12605,Shhh... Shut it! C'mon! Party.,michael
12606,"Hey! It's Angela! [Angela slams door shut, but not before Kevin sneaks out] Hey!",dwight
12607,We're going to ...,michael
12609,"I just think there are two, two specific kinds of people in the world. People who own houses and people who own condos. [turns to reach for pretzel while Second Cindy turns other direction] And... my question to you [points and pulls away other waitress] is do you agree?",michael
12611,Do you agree about what? [laughs] Wow. You're  lucky you're so darn cute.,michael
12613,What're you talking about?,michael
12615,All right [high fives Kevin],jim
12617,No. It was awful. I couldn't hear anything. [cheers from other party],dwight
12620,No... way! Yeah!,dwight
12622,Oh.,dwight
12624,Walkie-talkies.,dwight
12625,Can I talk to you a second?,pam
12626,Yes!,dwight
12628,[holds up rice krispie shaped like a star] In the name of Nutcracker Christmas.,pam
12631,"Yeah, but we don't have a power cord.",pam
12633,Mmm. Hmm.,pam
12635,We'll go tell everyone.,pam
12638,Your hands.,andy
12640,I'll use my hands on it.,andy
12643,"When you know, you just know.",michael
12645,Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable.,michael
12647,It's... it's one of those two. [points at both],michael
12650,"Yeah... well, it's been hard, they're wearing the exact same uniform. And I've been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike.",michael
12651,I honestly don't see what the big deal is. Stevie Wonder is married. Are you going to tell me that Stevie Wonder doesn't love his wife just because he's not sure what she looks like?,michael
12652,"Hey. Where's my girl? Is she in the fridge? Where is she hiding? I don't know where she is. 'Cause I'm drunk, I can't even find her.",michael
12654,"Haha, I do! I just haven't hugged you in awhile [marks Cindy's arm with a black marker]",michael
12656,"Oh, good. That felt good. Let's go. Party.",michael
12658,"[into walkie-talkie] Monkey, this is Possum. Do you copy?",dwight
12661,"What a horrible, horrible movie that was.",jim
12663,Thank you.,jim
12666,"Hey, hey, you. How are ya?",michael
12668,"No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and...",michael
12670,Where do you wanna go?,michael

12674,You want help? OK... Merry Christmas.,michael
12676,"[singing] Lady, from the moment I saw you standing all alone. You gave all the love that I needed...",dwight
12677,That waitress was the one.,michael
12678,No. She wasn't.,jim
12679,How can you be sure?,michael
12680,"Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately [looks a watch] three hours ago.",jim
12681,Don't make fun... You're making fun of me.,michael
12682,Sorry.,jim
12683,"I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm.",michael
12684,You what?,jim
12685,"I, I put a mark on her arm. [Both are laughing] So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike!",michael
12686,Yeah.,jim
12687,"Oh, why do I feel like crap?",michael
12688,You just had a rebound.,jim
12689,I had rebound? Yeah.,michael
12690,"Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.",jim
12691,"I totally rebounded. Someone else shoots and I take the ball and I score. Well, I guess I didn't score and I'm not sure who's actually shooting, but, whatever. Doesn't matter. It's all good. Or as my ex might say. Domo arigato, Mr. Scott-o.",michael
12693,"[on phone] Yes, I just wanted to see if, uh you would like to come to Jamaica with me. There's this resort called Sandals. Really? OK. All right. I promise you won't be disappointed. Umm, It's all-inclusive...",michael
12697,[singing along] pum pum pum pum pum pum pum,dwight
12698,Bye Pam.,dwight
12699,Night.,pam
12700,"[to Pam] Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents.",jim
12701,We should get him a bus ticket. [types on computer] To make his trip easier.,pam
12702,"Oh no, that would be great.",jim
12703,It costs seventy five dollars.,pam
12704,"Hmm... Well, maybe the CIA can send a helicopter?",jim
12705,Ohh... [laughs],pam
12706,[Cell phone beeps] What the? [Reading text message] 'You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone.' Destroy phone? [Dwight throws phone off of the roof and walks away],dwight
12707,"William Randolph Shakespeare once wrote in one of his plays, and I'm paraphrasing here, 'Love doth be poison.' Brilliant. And a lot of people don't give Shakespeare enough credit. They think it was somebody else. A-holes.",michael
12733,"No, no, no, no. You know what, I better hold off. I wanna make sure I don't dial Carol before I get drunk.",michael
12734,"So, really, you're just calling her?",jim
12735,Yeah. You know what? I am. I'm gonna call her. That's a good idea.,michael
12736,[from across the table] Where's Michael going? Michael? Is he sick? Is he choking?,dwight
12737,"[on [phone] No, I don't think I'm asking too much. I think it's only fair that you tell me exactly what I did wrong. Okay. Uh huh. Well that... yeah. Uh huh. All right. Well, could you tell me something that I did",michael
12769,"Oh, honey, here's Stanley.",michael
12771,"He is also in an interracial relationship, so, you know, if you have any problems, you can always call him.",michael
12773,"Sounds good. Okay, let's go.",michael
12774,"All right, let's get started. Umm... Oh, first off, we're supposed to be pushing cardstock this week. So... let's push cardstock this week. Uh, also... [to Dwight] what is this?",jim
12775,Tape recorder.,dwight
12776,For what?,jim
12777,For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.,dwight
12778,"OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm?",jim
12780,"Oh my God, Dwight, what're you doing?",jim
12781,What?,dwight
12782,You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.,jim
12783,I'm not.,dwight
12784,"Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife!",jim
12785,I do not have a knife!,dwight
12786,"No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?!",jim

12793,"Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.",jim
12794,You can't see... You can't see my stomach.,dwight
12795,I am now chopping off Phyllis' head with a chainsaw! ... Rin-in-in-in-in-in!,andy
12796,"Hey, mon!",michael
12797,Hey. You have a bunch of messages and... [sees Michael shaking head with beads in hair] that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.,pam
12798,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax.",michael
12799,OK.,pam
12800,"Just relax, OK? I'll get to all of it later.",michael
12801,It's kind of serious.,pam
12802,Aren't you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me.,michael
12803,How was Jamaica?,pam
12804,It was,michael
12806,"Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too.",michael
12808,"OK, well payroll is in charge of all that.",michael
12810,"Well, I am just getting settled in. So, I'm gonna...",michael

12818,"You know, I had never been out of the country before now?",michael
12819,Huh.,pam
12820,"Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time.",michael
12821,It's kind of an impoverished country.,pam

12825,"We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed.",pam
12826,I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it.,michael
12827,"Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don't make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans?",michael
12828,"Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it.",michael
12830,The Jamaicans don't have a word for 'impossible.',michael
12831,"Yep, it's English, it's 'impossible.'",jim
12833,"How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. That's all you need.",michael
12834,"Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling... and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign? [points to a TV monitor of a picture from Jamaica and reads] 'No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem.' This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem.",michael
12835,Oh my God. Is that Jan? [points to same monitor],pam
12837,On the left.,pam
12839,"No, no, no. No, that's a German woman named Urkel Grue.",michael
12840,"Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. That's all I'm gonna say. Sex. We had sex. I had sex with her. I had sex with Jan.",michael
12841,[on phone] Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica.,michael
12843,"Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay.",michael

12859,"That's great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me?",michael
12861,"OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not 'packaging.' Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?",michael
12863,"OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it.",michael
12865,And you sent that out to everyone?,michael
12867,Yikes.,jim
12869,Fantastic.,jim
12870,Boring. Call me if she rolls over.,andy
12871,Hey.,pam
12872,Hey.,jim
12873,You OK?,pam
12874,Yeah.,jim
12875,You sure?,pam
12876,"Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.",jim
12877,Oh. You want to talk about it?,pam
12878,Really?,jim
12879,I have a special assignment for you.,michael
12880,Who's the target?,dwight
12881,"A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is 'Jamaican Jan Sun Princess.'",michael
12882,What's it of?,dwight
12883,Not important.,michael
12884,"Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.",dwight
12885,"OK, forget it.",michael
12886,"OK, I accept it.",dwight
12887,"So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.",jim
12888,Hmm.,pam
12889,"Hmm, what?",jim
12890,"How far away does she live now, like ten minutes?",pam
12891,"Yeah, I guess.",jim
12892,"Honestly, I think you should go easy on her.",pam
12893,"No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah.",pam
12894,"Hey, thanks a lot.",jim
12895,"Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!",pam
12896,"Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping? [both start laughing]",jim
12898,"Not now, not ever.",michael
12900,"Aww, none of your business.",michael
12902,"That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops.",michael
12904,This is probably the icebreaker you need.,michael
12906,"I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you? Skeevy little perv.",michael
12908,"No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?",michael
12910,OK.,michael
12915,"[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it's Jan on the phone for you.",pam
12916,"Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I'm not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat.",michael
12917,"He'll call you back. OK, great.",pam
12918,She bought it? [Pam nods] OK. OK.,michael
12919,[to Jim and Ryan] Michael hit a deer?,dwight
12920,Michael! Michael! [pokes head through blinds in Michael's office] There's an emergency in the warehouse.,dwight
12921,There an accident? Somebody hurt?,michael
12922,"No, it's... involves the photograph.",dwight
12923,"Oh. God. No, no, no, no, no.",michael
12925,All right. [continued clapping and cheering for Michael],michael
12927,"Hello. Hi. Attention everyone. Um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rating picture of me and a woman---",michael
12929,"No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe...",michael
12930,Urkel Grue.,jim
12931,"My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right?",michael
12932,"Feelin'... feelin' hot, hot, hot! [plays conch shell]",michael
12933,Hey.,pam
12934,Hey.,michael
12935,What are you doing out here?,pam
12936,Island living. You know?,michael
12937,Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you.,pam
12938,Did she say what it's about?,michael
12939,That's all she said.,pam
12940,Ole ole - ole ole... Ole ole - ole ole. People in the party - hot hot hot [playing conch shell],andy
12941,"Uh, I think you dropped this [hands over piece of paper]",jim
12943,Definitely.,jim
12944,I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that [referring to large picture of Michael and Jan in Jamaica on the wall] be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.,dwight
12945,There are copies in the bathroom?,michael
12946,There were. A lot of them.,dwight
12947,All right.,michael
12949,Sorry?,pam
12951,"Oh, yeah, no. Don't worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous.",pam
12953,Sure.,pam
12955,Who did this to you? [refers to Pam crying] Where is he?,dwight
12956,"What? No, it's not... it's nothing.",pam
12957,[takes off coat to tie around waist] It's hot in here.,dwight
12958,Yeah.,pam
12959,Yeah.,dwight
12960,[Dwight hands out handkerchief] Thanks. You don't need to stay here.,pam
12961,"I know. [puts arm around Pam who continues to cry] So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh?",dwight
12963,Guh.,michael
12968,"OK, yup.",michael
12970,I...,michael
12972,I... I... Yes.,michael
12974,"OK, yeah.",michael
12976,Who is Dr. Perry? I...,michael
12978,"And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well.",michael
12980,"So, umm... thanks for coming by. So, I, uh...",michael
12982,"Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate - [Jan leans over and kisses Michael passionately]",michael
12984,"Jan, you... complete... me.",michael
12987,Yeah.,pam
12990,"I just had the best, most romantic week of my life in Sandals, Jamaica. Went with a lady, and we laid on the beach and drank fruity drinks for free, because it was all-inclusive. And then I flew back to Scranton, and then they lost one of my bags.",michael
12991,"Hey, Mister tally man, tally me banana, six hand, seven hand, eight hand, BRUNCH! [snickers] So delicious. Dinner, too. And every morning I would watch the sunrise and I would eat a mango. That is how I want to feel all the time. It's called island living. You know, how they say take a chill pill? In Jamaica, I took one. Guy on the beach sold it to me for $40. And after I finished vomiting, I was more relaxed than I ever have been. Lost six pounds, too. That's how I want every day to be.",michael
12992,"Michael sends me a postcard from every vacation he goes on. Atlantic City, he wishes I was here. Busch Gardens, Virginia, all I got was this lousy postcard. And this time, I'm Jamaican-him-crazy. I don't know how far away he thought he was, because he put $10 worth of stamps on this.",pam
12993,"Hello, you're back.",dwight
12994,"Yeah, mon. Me just got back to the office.",michael
12995,While you were gone...,dwight
12996,Me had an i-rey time.,michael
12997,"While you were gone, Jim glued my desk drawers together. He changed my voicemail so that my voice sounded like a chipmunk. He told me that we had a meeting at 4:00 AM, and I was the only one who showed up.",dwight
12998,"Dwight, please, please.",michael
12999,He turned over my...,dwight
13000,"I just got back from vacation, mon, all right? So chill. Let's don't... Don't harsh my mellow, mon.",michael
13001,"I took a vacation once. Never again. While I was away, Jim had my desk shipped to me in Roswell.",dwight
13002,"Presents. I got presents for everybody. Dwight, a genuine Rastafarian wig.",michael
13003,Unbelievable.,dwight
13004,"Andy, I got you a genuine Jamaican T-shirt. They love Milli Vanilli down there.",michael
13005,"I give thanks, mon.",andy
13006,"You are so welcome, mon. Angela, you just got leied. [puts lei on Angela]",michael
13008,"Yes, you did. Okay. Oh, Pam, I forgot to get you something.",michael
13009,That's okay.,pam
13010,I'm just kidding. Coconuts for your coconuts!,michael
13011,No.,pam
13012,[laughs] Try it on.,michael
13013,No.,pam
13014,Go ahead. Let me know if I miscalculated the size. I don't think I did.,michael
13015,Thank you.,pam
13016,"Stanley, I got you some ganja. I'm just kidding. It's coffee. I bet you wish it was ganja.",michael
13017,"I just got back from vacay. Come on. Give me a break, man. [holds up CD] Waves over Jamaica, $6.99.",michael
13021,"Okay, let me tell you a little story. When I was on vacation, I met a man named Bavon. And Bavon takes people parasailing. And you know what he said to me? He said that he loves going to work every day. How many of you can say that you love going to work every day like Bavon? [Dwight and Andy raises hand] No one.",michael
13023,"His name is Bavon. And you know what? I'm sure Bavon gets sick of his job, too. I'm sure he would like to take a day off. I'm sure he would like to spend a vacation selling paper, but he has the right attitude. And that is something that you learn when you go to Jamaica, and you really apply yourself.",michael
13024,"I would love to take them all to Jamaica, but is that good management? Yes. But is it the best management? Well, I can't afford it, and corporate won't pay for it. So who's the real criminal?",michael
13025,"How many of you know the meaning of the Jamaican term, Hakuna Matata?",michael
13026,[raises hand] Are you stoned?,jim
13027,I...,michael
13028,"In the picture, are you high?",jim
13029,"Oh, that's red eye.",michael
13030,Is that not what happens when you're high?,jim
13032,Well...,michael
13034,"Hey, can we just focus?",michael
13035,Michael and Jan together in Jamaica. I guess I would just need a little bit more evidence than seeing it with my own eyes.,pam
13042,Come on. Come on.,dwight
13043,"Okay. Well, Jan's email password is not Dunder Mifflin, Sandals, Jamaica, Michael, Michael Scott, Jan Scott, or Mrs. Jan Scott.",michael
13044,Try Dwight.,dwight
13045,"Her passwords aren't going to be Dwight, Dwight. That's stupid. Okay.",michael
13046,"Don't you have some sort of chaser or gobbler thing that you can send out that's able to eat up that other emails? I read about something like that. Well, I am in America and I am online, so I do think it involves you. Uh-huh. And if I were a subscriber, would then you be able to send out the gobbler? I'd... Yes, I will hold.",michael
13054,"The worst part about the Internet, when a secret is out, everyone knows. The best part about the Internet, that video of the dancing Indian midget, crossbow.org, massively multiplayer online gaming, i.e. Everquest. I also enjoy online banking.",dwight
13055,"Okay. So I went on the Internet, and she is not gonna find another apartment for that price. I mean this one is twice as much, and it doesn't have parking. Does she like to park?",pam
13056,"Oh, loves it.",jim
13057,Okay. This one is the same price but it's got...,pam
13058,Green walls.,jim
13059,I think that's mold.,pam
13060,Ooh... fancy.,jim
13061,"Spiderman, Peter Parker, would not reveal his love for Mary Jane for fear that she might be captured and harmed by the Green Goblin. Now, if Michael had studied the Spidey principles that I'd drawn up for him, Jan's boobs might not be all over the Internet. [Dwight pretends to shoot out webs from his palms]",dwight
13062,"Attention everyone! May I have your attention, please? Listen up. If we all work really hard and focus, we should be out of here in seven hours. Now, somewhere in these stacks, I have hidden a deck of cards. That should motivate you to keep your eyes open. If you find the deck of cards, you can redeem it with me in exchange for a free soft drink. [Jim shuffles the deck of cards] Get back... Back to work!",dwight

13079,Okay.,dwight
13080,Dang it.,andy
13081,Two at a time!,dwight

13084,"Hey, Stanley, in case I don't see you again after tonight, here is your bonus, $1,000 cash. Keep the change. [hands Stanley a piece of Jamaican currency]",michael
13086,It is Jamaican. The exchange rate is 65-to-1. I don't remember in which direction.,michael
13088,"Yes, good luck with that.",michael
13094,"You're a box short on the black, medium-line ballpoints.",dwight

13151,Yup. I'll trade.,jim

13170,Bueno.,andy

13176,"In order to take down Dwight, I have to chip away at his ally, which, in this case, is Michael. Here's the good news. Every success I've ever had at my job or with the lady-folk has come from my ability to slowly and painfully wear someone down.",andy
13177,What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?,andy
13178,"Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment.",michael
13179,"Wow, that is a long story, but quite well told, Michael. I find it very interesting. Especially about the part Dwight going behind your back and basically, like, being a terrible person. You know if you want your laundry done right? I used to work at Abercrombie. So, pretty good folder.",andy
13181,Really?,pam
13183,Ok. Sure.,pam
13191,Leave the keys.,dwight
13192,You still do that thing?,jim
13193,Leave the keys!,dwight
13194,"I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends.

13195,Hawkman.,michael
13196,My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons.,andy

13200,"Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.",jim
13201,"Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with... [Jim slaps Dwight]",dwight

13208,"You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big.",michael
13209,Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's nest. Also shot a deer once.,andy

13215,No.,michael
13216,"I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree.",andy

13218,Ow.,andy
13220,Oh man. Talk about your classic 'Lame dash O.' Do we even want that guy buying our paper?,andy
13221,Yes.,michael
13222,I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up.,andy
13223,"Ah, no. Don't worry about it.",michael
13224,I really 'Schruted' it.,andy
13225,What?,michael
13226,"Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?",andy
13227,I don't know. Who knows how words are formed.,michael

13290,"Yes, Andy.",michael
13291,"I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?",andy
13292,He didn't say.,michael
13293,"That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?",andy
13294,"No, you are remembering it wrong.",michael
13295,"Dwight betrayed me once before. So this is his strike two. You know what they say? Fool me once, strike one. But fool me twice, strike three.",michael
13296,I like Karen. She's pretty and appears intelligent.,dwight
13297,"Well, I like pretty women who have the appearance of intelligence.",jim
13298,My girlfriend is also beautiful and smart. She could be a model or a college professor which is intimidating to a lot of guys.,dwight

13300,No thank you.,dwight
13302,I knew it. [Dwight and Jim walk in],michael

13305,Sure. Look at you!,jim
13326,"Hey, we nailed the sale!",dwight
13327,Where were you this morning?,michael
13328,I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow.,dwight
13329,"Why do you lie, liar?",michael
13330,I am not a liar.,dwight
13331,You are lying right now.,michael
13332,It sure seems like he is lying.,andy
13333,"Stay out of this, you!",dwight

13335,"Michael, I cannot tell you what I was doing there. But you have to trust me, I would never do anything to hurt you or this company.",dwight
13336,"Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard.",michael
13337,That's what she said.,dwight
13338,Don't. Don't you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.,michael
13339,It's going to be ok.,dwight
13341,That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan.,dwight
13343,"Well, I don't have a lot of choices.",dwight

13351,"Ahem-hem-hem. May I have your attention please? This will only take a moment of your time. Although I love this company more than almost anything in the world, I have decided to step down from my post and spend more time with my family. I do not fear the unknown and I will meet my new challenges head-on and I will succeed. And I will laugh in the faces of those who doubt me. It has been a pleasure working with some of you and I will not forget those of you soon but remember, while today it is me, we all shall fall. In other words, I am quitting. So... .",dwight

13416,Do you want me to ask the cleaning crew if they stopped watering it?,pam
13417,Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.,michael

13433,"No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.",michael

13512,"Fine. I'll just sit at my desk and be quiet. Sorry I annoyed you with my friendship. [Andy's phone rings] Excuse me. And I'm also sorry that a lot of people here for some reason think it's funny to steal someone's personal property and hide it from them. Here's a little newsflash! It's not funny! In fact, it's pretty freakin' unfunny!  Oh, my GOD. [punches a hole in the wall] That... was an overreaction. Gonna hit the break room. Does anybody want anything? Pam, you good?",andy

13521,"Oh my God, she told you?",dwight
13522,"Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.",michael

13559,"Oh, man. [Kevin starts to put a blindfold on] No, no, no. I don't need it. Get out! [beats up pinata]",dwight
13560,It takes a big man to admit his mistake and that's what I did. The important thing is I learned something. I don't want somebody sucking up to me because they think I'm going to help their career. I want them sucking up to me because they genuinely love me. Hmm.,michael
13561,"So Michael had a little chat with corporate and they decided to send me to management training. Anger management, technically, but still. Management material. [gets out of his car] This whole thing supposed to take ten weeks, but I can be done in five. How? Name repetition, personality mirroring, and positive reinforcement through nods and smiles. So, don't worry about old Andy Bernard. I'll be back. Just like Rambo, so.",andy

13799,I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.,michael
13801,"No, today at work.",michael
13803,Yes. I kind of arranged it.,michael
13809,Really?  Looks like I hired the right guy.  I'm glad.  Any real potential there Beesley?,jim
13810,"Yeah, right.  God, I need a boyfriend.  You know Ryan I'm totally ready to be set up with one of your business school friends.  Whenever.",pam
13813,Yeah?  I lose my appetite all the time.,pam
13815,Thanks.,pam
13816,So you don't want to end our relationship?,michael
13818,That is so sweet.  You are the best GD girlfriend in the world.  Do you know that?,michael
13820,You are.  You are.,michael
13821,"So you know who turned out to be kind of a creep?  Ben Franklin.  And Elizabeth the stripper gave me great advice.  Which rhymed.  Really makes you wonder how Ben Franklin can become president, but someone like Elizabeth can't.",michael
13822,Are you near sighted or far sighted?,dwight
13824,GAH!!!,dwight
13825,"Damn, lost another file. Going to have to reboot. Again. [Windows reboot sound] Hey, Dwight, do you want an Altoid?",jim
13826,What do you think?,dwight
13827,"In school, we learned about this scientist who trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by feeding them whenever a bell rang. For the last couple of weeks I've been conducting a similar experiment.",jim
13828,"[Windows reboot sound] Dwight, want an Altoid?",jim
13829,Okay.,dwight
13830,[Windows reboot sound] Altoid?,jim

13836,I...,dwight
13837,What?,jim
13838,"I don't know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden. [nasty, dry mouth-smaking noise]",dwight
13839,"Always the bridesmaids, right ladies?",michael
13841,"Phyllis is getting married. And I am in the wedding party. She has asked me to push her father's wheelchair down the aisle. So, basically, I am co-giving away the bride. Since I pay her salary it is like I'm paying for the wedding. Which I'm happy to do. It's a big day for Phyllis. But it's an even bigger day for me. Employer of the bride.",michael
13843,"Phyllis... ended up using the exact same invitations as Roy and me. So it was kind of like being invited to my own wedding. And I was like 'Wait, thought I called that off'.",pam
13844,So what's in the box?,jim
13848,"Hello, Angela.",dwight
13850,You look as beautiful as the Queen of England.,dwight
13852,"The Shrutes have their own traditions.   We usually marry standing in our own graves. Makes the funerals very romantic, but the weddings are a bleak affair.",dwight
13853,Those flowers are nice.,jim
13855,Phyllis and Robert.,jim
13857,"Also, Pam and Roy.",pam
13858,There she is. I swear Phyllis you are as beautiful as the first day you started work at Dunder Mifflin.,michael
13860,How you doin'? You excited.,michael
13862,"Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight?",michael
13864,"You're probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It's okay, if you did. It's a very natural reaction. It's your wedding. And you're nervous...",michael
13866,Okay... umm... I'm sure that Bob... Wow. That is... that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah... Are you set on that hairstyle?,michael
13868,"Here, let me...",michael
13870,Just cover up that bald patch.,michael
13872,Okay.,michael
13873,You might be surprised to learn that I've only been to one other wedding. It's actually a very cute story. My Mom was marrying Jeff. And they asked me to be ring bearer. I was understandably emotional and somehow my pants became wet.,michael
13874,[in video of Michael as a kid] I hate you!,michael
13875,Long story short: Jeff's dog ended up as ring bearer. And the irony is that after the ceremony that dog peed on everything and nobody said 'boo'.,michael
13876,Why are all these people here? There are too many people on this Earth. We need a new plague. Who are all these people?,dwight
13877,You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.,jim
13878,No way.,dwight
13879,Did you ever see that movie?,jim
13880,Of course I saw it.,dwight
13881,"I saw Wedding Crashers accidentally. I bought a ticket for Grizzly Man and went into the wrong theatre. After an hour, I figured I was in the wrong theatre, but I kept waiting. That's the thing about bear attacks, they come when you least expect it.",dwight
13882,"You know I just wish, I wish, I had the investigative powers to smoke some of these guys out.",jim
13883,"Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift.",dwight
13891,"This strappy young lad sitting here is Phyllis' father, Albert, and he is quite the ladies' man, aren't you Albert, hah? Ah, ringbearer. I could have done better. I will do better. I am going to be better. I can't believe I'm actually doing this! Ooh! Are you ready for this, Albert? I am. Let's do it.",michael
13892,That's my dress.,pam
13893,[whispers to father] That's ok. [Albert gets out of his wheelchair and starts walking],michael
13894,It's a miracle.,dwight
13896,This is bull****!,michael
13897,Me walking Phyllis down the aisle was supposed to be the highlight of the wedding. And now... the wedding has no highlight.,michael
13898,"I can't believe I pushed that... that guy's lazy ass around all day... until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. That's... well... I got news for you, Albert. If that's your real name. The show's not over.",michael
13901,"Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!",michael
13903,"Oh, shiii...",michael
13907,"Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance. [generalized clapping and cheering] Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!",michael
13910,"Congratulations, Bob. You're a good man. But just know... if you ever lay a finger on Phyllis, I will kill you.",michael
13912,"Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis. [to Albert] Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too.",michael
13913,"Best of luck, Phyllis. Also I'm going to need to see a copy of the guest manifest as well as photographs of the caterers.",dwight
13915,"Dammit, Phyllis!",dwight
13917,What do you mean?,pam
13919,Oh... um... no.  That's... um... That's actually fine,pam
13921,"Okay, that's a lot of good ideas. Thanks",pam
13922,"Scuse me, sir. How do you know the happy couple?",dwight
13924,The bride and groom? What are their names?,dwight
13926,"Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on.",dwight
13928,"Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend.",dwight
13930,Phyllis! Are you happy with everything? What can I do to make it more perfecter?,michael
13932,I'm already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back.,michael
13934,I will take care of that.,michael
13935,I do. I know a fair amount about fine food... and drink. This is a white.,michael
13939,Hey.,pam
13941,"You're kidding me, right?",pam
13943,"Roy, I picked those flowers. Phyllis just stole all of my ideas for our wedding.",pam
13945,Yeah.,pam
13947,It's okay.,pam
13954,"Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I'm going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance.  One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster's Dictionary defines 'wedding' as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Scott, Phyllis' boss. To quote from The Princess Bride 'Mawige...",michael

13972,No. I'm such a dorky dancer.,pam

14000,Yeah. Yeah. He's kind of a weirdo.,michael
14002,You're... You're welcome.,michael
14003,They say that your wedding day goes by in such a flash that your lucky if you even get a piece of your own cake. I say that's crazy. I say let them eat cake. Margaret Thatcher said that about marriage. Smart broad.,michael

14015,"In business school, Kevin. Business school.",michael
14018,"A boss is like a teacher. And I am like the cool teacher. Like Mr. Handell. Mr. Handell would hang out with us, and he would tell us awesome jokes. And he actually hooked up with one of the students. Um... and then like twelve other kids came forward. It was in all the papers. ... Really ruined eighth grade for us.",michael
14019,Here we go. College Roadshow. Gotta bring our... A game. What was the most inspiring thing I've ever said to you?,michael

14030,We have fun.,michael
14032,"Okay, just so you know, it's just the students from my class in a little studio.",pam
14034,Thanks.,pam

Very, very interesting. [rips pages out of book] You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold. [gives book back] I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.",michael

14076,"So, you wanna start a business. How do you start? What do you need? Well, first of all, you need a building. And secondly, you need supply. You need something to sell. Now this could be anything. It could be... a... thingamajig. Or a... a whosi-whatsi. Or... [pulls out a candy bar] a Whatchamacallit [throws bar]. Now, you need to sell those in order to have a PayDay [takes out a PayDay, throws it]. And, if you sell enough of them, you will make a 100 Grand [throws 100 Grand bar].

14078,"Oh! No, you should go.",pam
14080,"Okay, I'm seeing some confused... faces out there. Let me slow down a little bit. Break this down. Okay. The more stickers you sell, the more profit, fancy word for money, you have to buy PlayStations and Beanie Babies.",michael
14082,...And products!,michael
14084,"Well... okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.",michael
14086,"We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down. [everyone types on their laptops]",michael
14088,"Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.",jim
14090,The glare off Angela's crucifix? It's blinding.,jim

14111,Flush him towards the door. On my go... NOW!,dwight
14114,"Yeah sure, you know business, sitting up here in your ivory tower. And your ebony tower. You know what? Tell you one thing, Dunder-Mifflin is here to stay.",michael
14116,David will always beat Goliath.,michael
14118,"Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, sex predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school?",michael
14120,"Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you. [walks out] SO SUCK ON THAT!",michael

14227,"I have a lot of big ideas, and the trick is to get it out of my brain and into theirs, in a way that is easy to swallow. Simple... [holds up snickers] Kids love candy bars.",michael
14228,"Lets try a little... Little social experiment here. Raise your hands if you like to buy things. OK, I see some people who like to buy things. You're it, you are the reason this world rolls along, give yourselves a round of applause. Say, say you want to start a business, and business is all about buying and selling, is it not? So say you want to sell lemonade, or stickers.

14263,"A lot of people think that magic camp is just for kids. And that's why so many other people in my class were kids. Self fulfilling prophecy. It's um, it's really for anybody with a dream and a belief in magic and a little extra time after school.",michael

14268,"I will get out. Oh yes, I will.",michael
14269,"So we shouldn't help you, no matter how much you might beg and plead?",pam
14270,"No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let's just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go. [Michael spits out key, Jim covers it with his foot.]",michael
14271,AHHHH!,michael
14273,Yes.,michael
14274,"I cannot tell you how I plan to escape. Other than by using magic. That is the magician's code. Separately, on an unrelated note, if you happen to find a small brass key...",michael

14283,"Michael, you go to parties all the time, why is tonight so special?' Well, tonight is so special because my boss's boss's boss, the CFO, not his initials, common mistake, is having a little shindig for all the managers in the company. And Jan and I are going as a couple. For the first time. So it's kind of our coming out party. Really. And that is why tonight is so special.",michael

14337,"Oh, that duck is so cute.",pam
14339,Hey guys.,pam
14341,Hi.,michael
14342,"Actually, it's polite to arrive early. And smart. Only really good friends show up early. Ergo de facto. Go to a party really early. Become a really good friend.",michael
14343,"Oh, um, potato salad.",michael
14344,It's from both of us.,dwight
14345,"No, it's not.",michael

14457,This one really smells like vanilla. Check that out.,michael
14459,You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas.,michael
14461,"Oh yeah, they don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis... there. But it's fun. It's an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo.",michael
14462,Oh.,jim
14463,Crazy.,michael
14465,Ok. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it?,michael
14467,What are you doing?,michael
14469,"Yes, but you could tell me. What... What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy.",michael
14471,What has gotten into you?,michael
14473,"No, no, no.",michael
14475,"Come on, let's go back to the party.",michael
14477,"Don't take that dress. Stop it, Jan.",michael
14479,"No, no, no, means please don't. Please.",michael
14481,I'm not going to slam you up against the wall.,michael
14483,You're acting inappropriate. Jan.,michael
14486,"Hey, where have you been all night? I was looking forward to hanging out with you.",pam
14488,"Hey, don't you have a daughter?",pam
14490,"Oh good, you're up. Hey, who makes this chair?",dwight
14492,I want one. It's got good solid construction. Comfortable. What is this? Oak?,dwight
14494,What do you know?,dwight
14496,"You stay here and have fun, because I'm going to go out back and shoot hoops with David Wallace.",jim
14498,"Wallace? What the hell, have you dated like every guy here? [Karen smiles and gives herself away] Wow. Ok. You got me.",jim
14500,"So, none of them?",jim
14502,Really?,jim
14504,Ok.,jim
14508,Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good. It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.,michael
14510,I don't know. Where to begin? My ball.,jim
14511,"The chimney is in decent shape. Not great. I found some termite damage in a crawl space and some structural flaws in the foundation so all in all, it was a pretty fun cocktail party.",dwight
14513,I want us to make it. I want a fresh start.,pam
14515,"Oh ok, but in order for us to make it, there can't be any secrets between us.",pam
14517,Just listen. Remember that casino night about a month before we were supposed to get married? I kissed Jim.,pam
14519,"He told me how he felt and I guess I had feelings too, and we kissed.",pam
14521,Just listen.,pam
14523,Don't yell!,pam
14525,This is over.,pam
14528,"Our first fight. If this is about what happened in the bathroom, there was no place to cuddle...",michael
14530,You didn't have any of the potato salad did you?,michael
14532,"Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly.",michael
14534,I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.,michael
14536,"I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.",michael
14538,Whatever.,michael
14540,"That's all, you didn't mean it?",michael
14542,"I love you, Jan.",michael
14544,"Don't break up you guys, you're great together.",dwight
14552,[laughs],pam
14561,"Ok, so promise that you'll wait till we leave the parking lot before you go to the bar.",jim
14562,Yes boss.,pam
14577,Why would the architect design stairs this wide?  Was there an obese family in here before you?,dwight
14579,How convenient.,dwight
14598,"Space shuttle. Which one?  Oh, Atlantis.  Good thing it's not the Discovery.  You play soccer?",dwight
14599,"What a weird day.  I don't understand it, but you don't get to understand everyday of your life.  Maybe five, ten days a year, I'll get home and I will have no idea what the hell just happened.  Guess everybody has days like that.  Sometimes they're the nicest ones.  Still, I think there might be something wrong with Jan.",michael
14601,I don't know.  Feel like... Friday night crowds...,jim
14603,Agoraphobic?,jim
14605,Really?,jim
14607,Absolutely correct.,jim
14609,"Kev, have a good weekend.",jim
14611,Here we go...,jim
14613,Ok...,jim
14615,Sounds good.,jim
14617,Hey... [Roy lunges towards Jim],jim
14618,ROY!,pam
14620,Roy don't! [Dwight pepper-sprays Roy],pam
14622,"Pam, please call security!",dwight
14623,"Everyday, for eight years, I have brought pepper spray into this office to protect myself and my fellow employees.  And everyday, for eight years, people have laughed at me.  Well, who's laughing now? [Dwight blinks and winces in pain from the pepper spray]",dwight
14624,"No need for consternation, everything is under control.",michael
14626,"It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.",michael
14628,No...,michael
14634,"No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage.",michael
14636,Yeppers.,michael
14638,I don't... remember.,michael
14640,Yeesh...,michael
14641,"I really don't want to talk about it.  I don't mean to be rude, but I just... I don't want to comment on what happened.  It",pam
14642,"I guess... all things considered, I was lucky Dwight was there.  And Roy was lucky that Dwight only used pepper spray.  And not the nunchucks or the throwing stars.",jim
14643,"Hey man, I never got a chance to thank you... for stopping Roy.  Thank you.",jim
14644,"Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted.  I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.",dwight
14645,Okay.  Um... Got you something.,jim
14646,Don't want it.,dwight
14647,You don't know what it is.,jim
14648,Don't want it.  Won't open it.  Don't need it.  Won't take it.  Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.,dwight
14649,"It was a little glass display case for his for his bobblehead.  That would have made us even, I think.  He saves my life, I get him a box for his desk toy.  Even Steven.",jim
14650,"No, don't call me a hero.  Do you know who the real heroes are?  The guys who wake up every morning, and go into their normal jobs, and get a distress call from the commissioner, and take off their glasses and change into capes and fly around fighting crime.  Those are the real heroes.",dwight
14659,"Ok I want you to be Darryl and ask me for a raise, because I want to try out some of these negotiation tactics on you.",michael
14660,Where'd you get that?,jim
14661,Wikipedia.,michael
14662,"Wikipedia... is the best thing ever.  Anyone in the world can write anything they want about any subject, so you know you are getting the best possible information.",michael
14663,"Ok, Darryl, ask me for a raise.",michael
14664,"Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.",jim
14665,"Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl.  I think... [mumbling softly] that maybe you should... [mumbling jibberish]",michael
14666,I can't hear you.,jim
14667,"What I'm saying is that, [continues to mumble jibberish]",michael
14668,Still nothin'.,jim
14669,"Ok, see what I did?",michael
14670,No.,jim
14671,"By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position.",michael
14672,Nice.,jim
14673,"Ok, let's try another one.  Um...",michael
14674,Okay.,jim
14675,Walking out of the room unexpectedly.,michael
14676,And what happens in this one?,jim
14677,It's a surprise.,michael
14678,Okay.,jim
14679,"Go ahead, ask me for a raise.",michael
14680,Can I have a raise?,jim
14681,[gets up and begins to walk out of the room],michael
14682,"[softly] Sex, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher.",jim
14683,What?,michael
14684,What?,jim
14685,"No, what did you say?",michael
14686,I didn't say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened.,jim
14687,Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna...,michael
14688,"I saw the perpetrator advance toward the victim at a high rate of speed.  His head was thrown back, his shoulder and arm cocked indicating an attack position.  Perp grabbed the victim.  I removed my weapon from its secure hiding place.",dwight
14690,"Irrelevant.  Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area.  Rendering him utterly and completely disabled.  Then I contacted the authorities.  The end.",dwight
14709,[knock on door] Yeah.,michael
14711,"Yes, yeah, absolutely.  Have a seat.",michael
14713,"You know what?  Actually, let's go into the conference room.",michael
14715,"No, you know what?  Let's stay here.  No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room.",michael
14716,Tactic number six.  Change the location of the meeting at the last second.  Totally throws 'em off.,michael
14717,"Number 14, declining to speak first.  Makes them feel uncomfortable, puts you in control.",michael
14718,[long pause] I am declining to speak first.,michael
14720,"Hmm.  Ohh, Darryl.  You are a good worker, and a good man.  I just, you know, times are tight.  And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now.",michael
14722,What?,michael
14724,"No, this is a power suit.",michael
14726,[Darryl laughs] I do not buy woman's clothes.  I would not make that mistake again.,michael
14728,Ohh... kay.,michael
14730,All right.,michael
14732,"Alright, you know what?  Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit?",michael
14733,"Oh my God, that's a woman's suit!",pam
14735,"No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK?  I got this out of a bin.",michael
14736,"There were these huge bins of clothes, and everybody was rifling through them like crazy, and I grabbed one.  And it fit!  So I don't think that this is totally just a woman's suit.  At the very least it's bisexual.",michael
14738,"Uh, [reading the inside of his jacket] MISSterious.  And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery.",michael
14740,Okay.,michael
14742,"Would you stop it, please?",michael
14743,"So, none of that tipped you off?",jim
14744,"It's European, OK?  It's a European cut.",michael
14745,"Michael, the pants don't have any pockets.",pam
14746,"No, they don't.  See?  [Michael lifts his jacket tail, sticks out his back side and shows Pam]",michael
14747,"[Laughing, covering her mouth]",pam
14748,Italians don't wear pockets.,michael
14749,It's been a really rough couple of days... This helps a little.,pam
14751,"No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway.",michael
14753,"Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes.",michael
14755,"Negotiations are all about controlling things.  About being in the driver's seat.  And make one tiny mistake, you're dead.  I made one tiny mistake.  I wore woman's clothes.",michael
14766,Let's get down to business.  Why don't you tell me why you think you deserve a raise.,michael
14768,[mumbles jibberish],michael
14770,[mumbling softly] That was a very good point.,michael
14772,[mumbling softly] You make a very compelling argument.,michael
14773,Sorry I almost got you killed.,pam
14774,"Yeah, that was nuts.",jim
14775,"He could have broken your nose or something.  Crazy.  It's just so stupid.  I mean, getting back with Roy and everything.  I mean, what was I thinking, right?",pam
14776,"No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.",jim
14777,"Not anymore.  It's, um... It's completely over now.",pam
14778,We'll see.  I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday.,jim
14779,Jim... I am really... sorry.,pam
14780,"Oh, yeah.  Don't worry about it.",jim
14781,"I am going to give you a piece of paper.  I want you to write down how much you want, and I want you to slide it back across the desk to me.",michael
14783,"Because, that is the way these things are done.  In... films. [Darryl writes the amount and starts to hand the paper to Michael] No, slide--- slide it, yes.",michael
14785,Oh. [scoffs] Come on.  Be serious.,michael
14787,"I... I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much.",michael
14789,I don't.  Want me to prove it to you?  There is... a pay stub.,michael

14793,Fourteen years.,michael
14795,"No, please, please...",michael
14797,"Ok, let's take 15, again.",michael
14798,"A boss's salary isn't just about money, it is about perks.  It... for example, every year I get a $100 gas card... Can't put a price tag on that.",michael

14924,"Why don't you just take that pen and stab me in the heart.  This is me, Jan.  This is me!",michael
14926,"Okay, no, no, no, no.  You do not try tactic number eight on me.  I invented tactic number eight.  I'm not going anywhere.",michael
14931,"Ohh.  It was a weird day.  I accidentally cross-dressed.  And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money.  And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby.  And then, your assistant, is all young and hot.  And I---",michael
14933,Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make---,michael
14935,"Ah, so...  All right, Levinson.  Here's the rub.  I would like a 15% raise.",michael
14937,But you just said 15.,michael
14938,"Negotiation is an art.  Back and forth.  Give and take.  And today, both Darryl and I took something.  Higher salaries.  Win win win.  But you know, life is about more... than just salaries.  It's about perks.  Like having sex with Jan--",michael
14945,Really?,dwight
14947,"Mm, good stuff.",dwight
14949,"Sounds... fun. [they kiss, Jim walks out of the bathroom and sees]",dwight

14951,"I graduated from anger management the same way I graduated from Cornell.  On time.  Now I'm back.  Got a second chance, and I'm not gonna blow it.

14955,"Look, I am not a gazillionaire.  I can't... I can't dress like Donald Trump dresses.  I have to stay within the parameters of my budget.  I can't shop at a fancy Norwegian boutique.  I buy my suits the old fashioned way.  I buy them from discount stores... or on eBay.  And when I found out that Ross was having a midnight madness sale, I ran, not walked, as per the instructions on the flier.  And I got there, and when the doors opened, all of these women ran to this one bin.  And I did too.  And I grabbed this suit.  And a woman, sort of a, I don't know, Missy Elliot type, grabbed the jacket.  And, uh, we had kind of a heated tug of war.  And I could tell by the way she was screaming that this must be a get.  And I figured she was just buying it for her husband, to answer your question from before.  Um, anyway, she s... socked me, in the eye.  And she got it, she got the suit.  But, I went to the Ross, in Trenton New Jersey, and I found the exact same suit.  And I didn't have to deal with Missy Elliot.",michael
14956,"Good morning, Pam.",andy
14957,"Oh, welcome back, Andy.",pam
14958,Drew.  I'm Drew now.,andy

14970,Drew. [walks to Dwight] Dwight.  How's it goin' man?,andy
14971,"Yes, I have decided to shun Andy Bernard for the next three years.  Which I'm looking forward to.  It's an Amish technique.  It's like slapping someone with silence.  I was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday... for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna.",dwight
14972,"Jim, could you please inform Andy Bernard that he is being shunned.",dwight
14973,"Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.",jim
14974,"Ok, tell him that's not true.",dwight
14975,Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks.,jim
14976,You guys...,andy

15031,...would I go near---,michael
15033,"Toby now has the floor...  and he is going to try not to screw this up, like everything else in his life.  Let me rephrase that.  I believe that you can do safety training and make it sound just as good as Darryl.  Here we go!",michael
15035,"Yes, good.  Fine.  Like stretching and...",michael
15037,"Wow, that is... that time really adds up.  That's like... a half an hour, every hour?",michael
15039,"Ok, you know what?  You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff.  Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?",michael
15045,"Ok, you know what?  I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.  [to warehouse guys]  Sorry, he is very lame.  [takes book from Toby] Um, let's see.  'Seasonal affective disorder!  A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter.'",michael
15048,"Ok guys, you know what?  I didn't--- I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation.",michael

15052,Yes.  'Which can contribute to heart disease.'  Heart disease kills more people that balers.,michael

15069,"Okay.  ... What, Nerf isn't cool anymore?",michael
15070,"Darryl thinks he is such a man because he works in a warehouse.  I worked in a warehouse.  Men's Warehouse.  I was a greeter.  I'd like to see Darryl greet people.  Probably make 'em feel like wimps.  Not me, I...  'Hello, I'm Michael.  Welcome to Men's Warehouse.  We have a special on khaki pants today.' ... This is one example.",michael
15073,There's like ten green ones.,jim

15090,"Okay, okay.",jim
15092,Okay.,jim
15093,"Pam, depression is as scary as a baler, right?",michael
15094,I don't understand the question.,pam
15095,Working in an office can lead to depression.  Which can lead to suicide.  I mean this is really serious stuff.,michael
15096,Yeah...,pam
15097,"I--- I---  Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that...",michael
15098,It's really hard to demonstrate depression.  Their safety training had visuals.,pam
15099,"Yeah... you are... ah, so right.  They had visual aids.  And all we had were the facts.  You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity.  You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science.",michael
15100,"So, you're okay?",pam
15101,Indubitably.,michael
15102,"They use props.  They use visual aids, and they just made us look like dopes.",michael

15108,Yes.,michael
15109,A quilt.  Depression quilt?,dwight
15110,No time to sew a quilt.  ... I got it.  Give me the number for the Giant Big Box Toy Store.,michael
15111,"You may be asking yourself, 'What am I doing on a trampoline?'  Well, I thought I'd bounce here for a while, relieve some stress, and then move on with my day.  Not!  Here's the plan.  Dwight, is going to gather all of the office workers and all of the warehouse guys, we're going to have another safety seminar.  Only this time, where's Michael?  Oh my God!  He is on the roof!  Now I have got their attention.  I... tell them, about the cold hard facts of depression.  And then I say, 'Hey!  You ever seen a suicide?'  And I jump.  And they freak out.  And they get to see... the dangers of depression with their own eyes.  Nice side note: They might think 'Hey, I should have been nicer to Michael.'  But that's... not why I'm doing this... Then, I land on the trampoline, take a couple extra bounces for fun.  I climb off, walk around the corner... Ta-freakin'-da!  [Dwight nods]",michael
15116,"[on the roof] Okay, let's do this thing!  I'll go summon the troops!",dwight
15117,"Maybe we should test it first.  Letterman-style.  Throw a TV over, or...",michael
15118,We measured it once...,dwight

15134,BINGO!  WHOA WHOA WHOA!  Oh... crap.  Deactivate the car alarm.  Clean up the mess.,michael
15135,Okay.,dwight
15136,"Find out whose car that is.  If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes.",michael
15137,Got it.,dwight
15138,"Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.",michael
15139,We're not allowed to use the baler.,dwight
15140,"Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster.",michael
15141,I'm on it!,dwight
15142,I'm temporarily lifting the shun.,dwight
15143,Thank you.,andy
15144,It means nothing.  I need you to do something for me.,dwight
15145,Anything.,andy
15146,"Okay, calm down.  I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.",dwight
15147,You mean a moon bounce.,andy

15156,I don't know if I wanna do this.,michael
15157,Do you wanna do another test?  I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!,dwight
15158,"No.  No more.  The tests are going terrible.  If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump.  This is about doing, not thinking.",michael
15159,That's right!  Doing!  Totally doing!  It's rock n' roll!,dwight
15160,Rock n' roll!,michael
15161,Yeah!,dwight
15162,That's right!  I am not thinking.,michael

15174,"Ok, when's the shunning thing gonna end?",andy
15175,Un-shun.  Never.  Re-shun.  I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!,dwight

15184,"[on megaphone] Michael, what's wrong?!",dwight
15185,"Everything's wrong.  The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.",michael
15186,Depression?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?,dwight
15187,"Dwight, you ignorant slut.  Depression is a very serious illness.  Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year!  According to a 2004 study!",michael
15188,Is that the last year the data was available?,dwight
15189,Yes!  My head is in such pain!  And turmoil!,michael
15190,Don't do anything rash!,dwight

15208,"Dwight, you ignorant slut.",michael
15209,"Well, you know, the first performance was a little off.  But I really think they hit their stride, in the second show.  Um, might even bring my parents tomorrow, to the matinee.",jim
15210,"And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!",michael
15211,"Oh, excuse me.  It's my... favorite part.",jim
15215,"Oh my God, there",jim

15230,"Dwight, you are such a liar.  Pam, really, what is it?",michael
15232,"You told me, that I lead a... cushy, wimpy, Nerf life.",michael
15234,What do I have to live for?,michael
15236,"It's complicated with Jan.  And I don't know where I stand, or what I want.  The sex isn't nearly as good as it used to be.",michael

15242,I Braveheart.  I am.,michael
15244,"Okay.  Pam, I'm coming down to get my present.",michael
15245,"An office... is as safe as the people in it.  And sometimes those people can drive you to do crazy things to show the dangers of the office.  That's the danger I found myself in today.  I saved a life.  My own.  Am I a hero?  I really can't say.  But, yes.",michael
15246,"When people think of Andy, they think of hate and anger. When people think of Drew, they think of baked goods.",andy

15259,Umm... [draws back arm] No. [laughs],andy
15260,"People don't need to be afraid of me. I can't achieve anger any more, and I have a new car. Toyota Prius, because Andy didn't care about fuel efficiency, but Drew has seen 'An Inconvenient Truth'. Nearly twice.",andy

15286,But it was not a fair fight.,michael
15287,"No it was not. Remind me again, what was the fight exactly, who was it between, and what was the outcome?",dwight
15288,It was the warehouse guys...,michael
15289,Right.,dwight
15290,"... Dwight, they embarrassed us...",michael
15291,Argh!,dwight
15292,... because they had a much scarier safety presentation.,michael
15293,Ghaaa!,dwight
15294,"You know what's funny? Robin Williams. [sighs] When a cat gets stuck in a washing machine. City Slickers. Talking like Borat. You know what's not funny? Safety, or making fun of the person trying to talk about safety. [in Borat voice] Not nice. I must show people how dangerous office can be. High five... Now that's funny.",michael
15295,How do you make depression sexy? How do you... How do you get people interested in depression? That is the conon... the conun... the conumbery,michael

15302,"OK, ahh, turn around, and do a broad jump for me on go. Ready... Go! One Mississ... OK, you went that far on one Mississ. Ippi would take you to here. This trajectory times the propulsion from your quadriceps would be about three Mississippi, maybe three and a quarter. So one Mississ... correct... ippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi... e. Right here.",dwight
15303,"OK, good. Thank you. Wanna take our time, do this right.",michael
15309,"[Michael is up on the roof of the building] Michael, go ahead, we're listening.",andy
15310,"I'm going to wait. I don't want to say this twice, it's too painful and I'm too depressed.",michael

15795,"Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your penis. [everyone is shocked] [exhales]I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.",michael
15796,"In all the excitement, I forgot that my primary goal is to keep people safe. Women can't have fun if they don't feel safe. For example, Jan and I have a safe word in case things go too far. Foliage. And if one of us says that word, the other one has to stop. Although last time... she pretended she didn't hear me.",michael
15798,Huh?,michael
15800,I don't know. I feel... I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tolls -,michael
15802,"Um, that... I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.",michael

15809,Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.,dwight
15810,OK.,michael
15811,"[lays a folder full of pictures on Michael's desk] There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.",dwight
15812,This is the last,michael
15813,Look at that one.,dwight

15817,[raises hand] Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?,jim
15818,"Answer: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what you're thinking. [Pam nods] Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of. Why don't you work with  Phallus on drawing a picture of the exposer that I can post around the community?",dwight
15819,Phallus?,pam
15820,"Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.",dwight
15821,"I don't often miss Roy. But I can tell you one thing. I wish someone had flashed me when I was with Roy. Because that would have been the ass-kicking of the year. [small laugh] Especially if it had been Jim. He would not have wanted me to have seen Jim's... Whoo, I am... I am saying a lot of things.",pam
15823,That's OK. I don't feel like answering phones.,pam

15829,"OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.",michael
15831,"See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?",michael
15832,"Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?",dwight
15833,"No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation.",michael
15834,"Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?",jim
15835,"Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?",michael

15844,"Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.",michael
15847,"OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.",michael
15848,Alien,dwight
15849,"What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. [points to Pam] Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.",michael
15850,"If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models.",andy
15853,"Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.",michael
15855,No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.,michael
15858,Yes.,michael

15863,I wish I could menstruate.,dwight
15864,"If I could menstruate, I wouldn't have to deal with idiotic calendars anymore. I'd just be able to count down from my previous cycle. Plus, I'd be more in tune with the moon and the tides.",dwight
15866,"Ye - OK, yes.",michael
15868,"You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall. [Kelly gasps]",michael
15871,"OK, let's go, ladies of Dunder-Mifflin. Hey, we should have a calendar printed up. Pam, put that in my good idea folder. [Pam nods] Let's go!",michael

15892,I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.,andy
15893,"Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.",dwight
15894,This guy looks like a real deviant.,andy
15895,"No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.",dwight
15896,"Aye, aye, Cap'n.",andy

15913,All right. Hope nobody's on a diet.,michael

15917,What do you want to dish about?,pam
15918,"Anything you guys want. This is your time. [everyone is silent or continues to eat, Michael exhales] Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it 'shmear?' Like the cream cheese.",michael

15921,"What, um... what do you think of role-play?",michael
15923,"Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.",michael

15928,"Michael, you shouldn't do anything that you're uncomfortable with.",pam
15929,Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.,michael
15930,"Oh, my God.",pam
15931,[groans] And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.,michael
15933,"No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.",michael

15935,"No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing.",michael
15936,"No, normal women don't do stuff like that. This is bad. [Karen nods and Michael looks like he's about to start crying]",pam
15937,"No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK. [sniffing] You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan? [sighs]",michael
15938,Read the pros first.,pam
15939,"OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.",michael

15946,I'm unhappy when I'm with her.,michael

15948,I'm happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.,michael
15950,"Yeah, that's smart.",michael
15951,Maybe. But it sounds like you're just wrong for each other.,pam

15959,"Let's face it, most guys are from the Dark Ages. They're caveman. And they like a woman to be showing her cleavage and to be wearing 8-inch heels, and to be wearing, um, see-through underpants. But... for me, a woman looks best when she is just absolutely naked.",michael
15967,"Mm. You don't want anything? My treat. Some panties or... pick a thong or... G-string. T-back. Get a nice bra. Padded bra. See-through, push-up, lace? Thigh-high? Bustier? Any - it just - you know what, I would love to buy you a fresh set of underwear.",michael

16193,Does it have to do with these shopping bags filled with hot dogs?,pam
16194,"Smart as a whip! Yes! [holds up hot dog packages] These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.",michael
16195,When's the contest?,pam
16196,Like umm...[looks at watch] ten minutes?,michael

16199,A good manager has got to be hungry. Hungry for success.,michael

[sighs at the table] For those of you who are curious, the world record is 54 and one half hot dogs. Wow! And you know what? I personally have cooked up enough so each and every one of you could break that record. So shoot for the stars, OK? Alright, the team that eats the most hot dogs in ten minutes will be declared the winner. On you mark. Get set.",michael

16215,You're leaving?,dwight
16216,I didn't want to tell anyway. I didn't want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.,michael

16224,"13 hot dogs, everybody!",michael
16225,Damn it!,dwight
16227,Sabotage.,dwight

16263,"I knew that finding a successor would be difficult. I did not know that it would be impossible. Thus far the candidates have been wildly disappointing. Uh, Jim is not taking it seriously. Uh, Stanley is having a stroke. And Andy, where is he? Where the hell is Andy? Where is he, Pam? Do you know? Ah... who's ahead in points?",michael
16264,"I think they're even. At various times you gave Jim ten points, Dwight a gold star, and Stanley a thumbs up. And I don't really know how to compare those units.",pam
16265,Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.,michael
16266,"I really doubt it, Michael.",pam

16687,What happened?,pam
16688,"Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger.",michael
16689,"Here's the sitch. Two weeks ago, I was in the worst relationship of my life.  She treated me poorly.  We didn't connect, I was miserable. Now, I'm in the best relationship of my life with the same woman.  Love is a mystery.",michael

16729,"Oh, and Hunter?  Could you tell her, [Michael shakes his head and makes the 'motorboat' noise] 'Brbrbrbrbr!' also?",michael
16730,You showed great leadership potential at the coal walk.  Even if you did follow it with that embarrassing personal confession.,dwight
16731,Thank you.,pam
16732,"I had to make Andy my number two.  It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand.  I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.",dwight
16733,Really?,pam

16735,You will be your own assistant.,pam
16736,"Correct, I need someone I can trust.  But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you.  Just stripped of its pomp and frills.",dwight
16737,"Okay.  So... you would be the Regional Manager,",pam
16738,"Mmmmmm, let's call it Secret Assistant",dwight
16739,Mm-hmm.,pam
16740,Do you accept?,dwight
16741,"Absolutely, I do.",pam

16745,Good to see you.  Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.,michael

16749,"Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.",michael
16751,Thank you.,michael
16755,Then who do you think will get the job?,pam
16761,"Listen up!  Come to the center of the room, please.  This... [holds up paper that resemles a sheet sized dollar bill with Dwight's face in the middle] is a Schrute Buck.  When you have done something good, you will receive one Schrute Buck.  One thousand Schrute Bucks... equals an extra five minutes for lunch.",dwight

16763,"Excellent question, Pam.  1/100th of a cent.",dwight
16765,Just... zip your lid!  Another announcement.  Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness.  No longer.  No more meetings!,dwight
16767,"Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.",dwight
16769,"Yes!  Michael is gone.  There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is 'me.'  Conference room!  Ten seconds!  All of you!",dwight
16770,I literally cannot wait to see what Dwight has planned.  And I wish Jim were here.,pam
16772,"I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin.  I was thinking we could name the company something like, 'Paper Great.  Where great paper is our passion.  We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!'

16774,Okay.,michael
16776,Thank you.,michael
16778,It is always a treat when,michael

16782,"I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it?",michael
16784,Listen up.  Let's start... from the ground,dwight
16786,Trees!  And where do trees grow?,dwight
16788,"Soil. Right.  We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil.  Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth?  Probably phosphorus, right? [Angela smiles, shakes her head 'no']  Wrong!  It's nitrogen!  Absorb this information.  Good!  Now, let us discuss precipitation.  Stanley!  When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state?",dwight

16823,Cool.  Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.,michael
16825,"Daaah, let's just run away together.  Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would... be fine.  We'd have fun.",michael

16843,Hey!,michael
16845,No--- We're all unstable.,michael

16858,"So, I am gonna... give her a ride home.  Let me know about the job.",michael
16860,"Good, I'm glad we're on the same page.  I have a lot of ideas for new directions.",michael
16862,"You know what?  That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job.  That's not being a good boyfriend.  So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.  Do you accept my withdrawal?",michael
16864,"Good.  Very good.  I'm glad we are finally on the same page.  Still have my job in Scranton, though.",michael
16866,Good.  That's all I ever wanted.  These two. [points at Jim and Karen] Either one of them... excellent candidates.,michael
16868,Yeah.  Kinda feel bad for her though.,jim

16883,[whispers] I don't know.  [normal volume] Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo.  I think I could back out of the sale. [Jan exhales] Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.,michael

I know, I know, I know.  'Michael, what are you thinking?  You were a shoe in.'  Well, got down there.  I nailed the interview.  And the strangest thing happened.  Why is my office black?",michael
16889,To intimidate my subordinates.,dwight
16890,That's stupid.,michael
16891,It was Andy's idea.,dwight

We're friends.  And I'm sure we'll stay friends.  We just, we never got the timing right.  You know?  I shot him down, and then he did the same to me, and...  But you know what?  It's OK.

And in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and I have a remote that works everything, that has like a belt-loop attachment, or in my ear, like a gluetooth.

She told me, very clearly, just because we were broken up didn't mean she was going anywhere, because she worked really hard for her career. But the next day her desk was empty, and as for me and my current romantic life, I uh... I'm single now and looking, so if you know anybody.",jim
16985,Jim and I went to dinner a few times when he got back from New York. I talked him through his break up. It's really nice to be good friends again.,pam
16989,And Sunday I'm thinking of going to that flea-market at the drive-in.,pam
16990,Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.,jim
16991,Cool.,pam
16992,Yeah.,jim
16993,Well have fun with that.,pam
16994,Ladies and Gentlemen. I have some bad news. Meredith was hit by a car.,michael
16995,What?,jim
16996,Where?,dwight
16997,"It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could... And she is going to be OK.",michael
17000,"Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse.",michael
17001,Thank God you were there.,pam
17002,Yeah.,michael
17003,Did you see who did it?,andy
17004,No need we can just check the security tapes.,dwight
17005,Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.,michael
17006,Who was driving?,jim
17007,"Oh, Michael.",pam
17008,One day Michael came in complaining about a speed bump on the highway. I wonder who he ran over then.,jim
17009,It's only Meredith.,dwight
17010,"Yeah, it's only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something.",michael
17011,Hey... Why did you do it?,dwight
17012,It was an accident.,michael
17013,Was she talkin' back?,dwight
17014,No.,michael
17015,Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?,dwight
17016,"Hey guys, we're all gonna visit Meredith at lunch. And we're kicking in $5 for flowers.",pam
17018,"No, uh, me Stanley and Phyllis so far.",pam
17020,"Yeah, I haven't asked him yet.",pam
17022,I was planning on it.,pam
17024,Angela?,pam
17027,[to Angela] Are you coming?,pam
17031,Can't your other cats keep her company.,pam
17033,"Angela, you're the chairman of the party planning committee. I shouldn't even be planning this, it's your job.",pam
17035,My lord my liege.,michael
17037,"So Ryan got promoted to corporate, where he is a little fish in a big pond. Whereas back here in Scranton I am still top dog, in a fairly large pond. So who is the real boss? The dog or a fish?",michael
17038,So I need a little treat for the gang. Something to win their affections back.,michael
17040,"Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.",michael
17042,"No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in...",michael
17044,"Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine.",michael
17046,"Oh, right, I'm sorry. What is: we are fine?",michael
17050,"Hey monkey, what's up?",dwight
17052,Sure.,dwight
17054,"Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp.",dwight
17056,So what do you need me to do?,dwight
17058,Mm-hmm.,dwight
17060,"Ok, I have an announcement.",michael
17062,No.,michael
17064,"No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.",michael
17065,"Oh good, so we don't have to work.",jim
17066,"OK, we're leaving for the hospital at 1.",pam
17067,"So, like a freedom tree.",michael
17068,I can take 3 people.,pam
17069,I can also take 3 people.,jim
17071,Pam.,michael
17072,"Alright, I will get a card at the hospital and we'll sign it outside her room.",pam
17073,Pam.,michael
17074,Sales people can go later in the day. Hourly works can go at lunch.,pam
17075,"Ok, good good, so we'll just all go down there together at lunch.",michael
17076,I...,pam
17077,Excellent!,michael
17078,I was thinking that we...,pam
17079,Good work Pam.,michael
17080,But...,pam
17081,"Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?",michael
17083,"Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!",michael
17084,"Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh, I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I'll hit somebody with my car. So sue me... No, don't sue me. That is the opposite of the point that I'm trying to make.",michael
17085,Eww. I hate hospitals. In my mind they are associated with sickness. Oh... She looks like an angel.,michael
17087,"No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault.",michael
17088,I think she's awake.,jim
17089,No... She's in a coma.,michael
17091,"OK... Meredith, [hauntingly] Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear.",michael
17093,Yeah.,michael
17096,"Brought you some balloons. Why don't we... here you go. [wraps them around her IV] Tie these up, cheer up your tubes... [IV pops out] Oh! Shhhh... For God's sake!",michael
17098,Nurse.,michael
17100,[groaning] I am going to be sick... I'm gonna puke.,michael
17101,I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it.,jim
17111,"Oh, OK... Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.",michael
17113,Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.,michael
17115,"Well, just shhhh... just just...",michael
17117,"Look, I just... I don't understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.",michael
17119,Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.,michael
17120,Michael! Michael!,pam
17122,Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked. But it's not like a compulsive need to be liked. Like my need to be praised.,michael
17124,Hey monkey.,dwight
17126,"Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead.",dwight
17128,"Sparkles, the white one, is dead.",dwight
17130,"That was the sick one, right?",dwight
17132,No.,dwight
17134,Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat.,dwight
17136,"So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place.",dwight
17138,"Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor.",dwight
17140,[to Angela] It's gonna be OK.,pam
17141,"OK, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let's just...",michael
17142,"Michael, Angela's cat died.",pam
17143,Sprinkles?,michael
17145,"[sighs] Oh, sh... I'm sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then... Sprinkles! God, that's 3 things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.",michael
17146,"Well, I am taking responsibility. It is up to me to get rid of the curse that hit Meredith with my car. I'm not superstitious, but... I'm... I am a little-stitious.",michael
17147,Did anyone do anything involving an Indian burial ground?,michael
17149,Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us?,michael
17151,That's cool.,pam
17153,Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.,michael
17155,She's only a cat.,dwight
17157,Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.,dwight
17159,"Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you?",michael
17160,"No, I have not.",dwight
17161,"Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.",michael
17162,"I do not respect her, but I will go.",dwight
17163,"Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.",michael
17165,Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.,michael
17167,"Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright let's just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.",michael
17169,OK.,michael
17171,Alright.,michael
17172,Oh me too.,pam
17174,[puts hand up for high five] Same religion.,pam
17179,"Kelly, you are Hindu, so you believe in Buddha.",michael
17181,Are you sure?,michael
17183,What are you?,michael
17185,"OK, 1 Sikh, and...",michael
17186,"As a farmer, I know that when an animal is sick, sometimes the right thing to do is to put it out of its misery. With the electricity we're using to keep Meredith alive we could power a small fan for 2 days. You tell me what's unethical.",dwight
17187,Blink once if you want me to pull the plug.,dwight
17192,"Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?",dwight
17194,"Pfft... Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one.",dwight
17197,Just doing my job.,dwight
17200,"You spend your whole life trying to get people to like you, and then you run over one person with your car. [sighs] And it's not even one of the popular ones, and everybody gets on your case. Doesn't make any sense... God is dead.",michael
17202,"Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine.",michael
17203,I will do some research.,jim
17204,I can help you with that.,pam
17205,"So, just to be safe they are giving her the rabies vaccine.",dwight
17206,"Oh God, Rabies?",michael
17207,Mm-hmm.,dwight
17208,"I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?",michael
17209,"No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something.",dwight
17210,This place is so cursed.,michael
17211,"Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw.",dwight
17212,"[walks out into the office] I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.",michael
17213,"Six of one, really.",jim
17214,"Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people! [Kevin claps] Oh... there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished.",michael
17215,"Is there a God? If not, what are all the churches for? And who is Jesus' dad?",michael
17217,"[Pam's car pulls out of parking lot and then off to the side of the road] I told you I'm not dating anyone. And even if I was, I don't think it's anyone's business. I mean, when I do fall in love, like when it's for real, the last person I'm gonna talk about it too is a camera crew, or my co-workers.

And that is why I'm hosting a fun run race for the cure for rabies. To raise awareness of the fact that there is a cure for rabies. A disease that has largely been eradicated in the US. But not very many people know that.",michael
17223,"Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?",michael
17225,"Come on man, gotta step it up! It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.",michael
17226,Isn't that your money?,andy
17227,"That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, how's the rabies quilt coming?",michael
17229,"Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.",michael
17231,Yes.,michael
17233,OK. [walks away],michael
17235,"Alright, alright.",michael
17237,Shhh...,michael
17239,I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.,michael
17241,"OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... And I was a peasant.",michael

17244,"[in bathroom] I'm petrified of nipple chafing. Once it starts it is a vicious circle. If you have sensitive nipples, they chafe, so they become more sensitive, so they chafe more. So... I take precautions. [tapes a cotton ball to each nipple]",andy

17262,What?,jim
17263,Then I'm gonna end fast.,pam

17282,"We have raised, almost $700.00, most of it from me and Jan. Um... when do they put that on the giant check? Or is that something that we write in later?",michael
17283,"Well a giant check costs about $200.00 to make up. I have a print shop standing by but... What do you think Michael, that's over 25% of our funds?",pam
17284,Hmm... That's a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So...,michael
17285,"Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.",jim
17286,Giant check it is.,pam
17287,Yeah.,jim
17288,Yep.,michael
17289,"Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.",dwight
17290,Bat birth control,jim
17291,"Wait, this money is going to bat birth control, right Michael, that's what you told me when I contributed.",dwight
17292,You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going?,michael
17293,"Not well. A doctor won't come out to collect a check for $700.00, or $500.00 if we go with the giant check.",pam
17294,Which we are.,jim
17295,And also there is no such thing as a rabies doctor.,pam
17296,What about a rabies nurse?,michael
17297,I don't think so.,pam
17298,"You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.",jim
17299,That's possible. Look into that.,michael
17300,"Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.",jim

17322,You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?,jim
17323,"Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.",michael
17324,"On average, how many hours a day do you spend naked in your office? Just ballpark.",pam
17325,European offices are naked all the time.,michael
17326,They're so not.,pam

17329,[sighs] Gross.,jim
17330,"That's not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? OK, let's go have some fun.",michael
17331,Alright.,jim
17332,They say if you're nervous around someone you should picture them naked. I do not recommend this strategy. Try picturing them with more clothes on... or a funny coat.,pam

17342,"What? Look, no it was not...",pam
17344,"OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies. [turns around a picture of Meredith in the hospital] That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth: 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing.",michael
17346,"No, don't give him... just, did you hear anything I said?",michael
17348,"He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse? [Elizabeth walks up in nurse's outfit] This is the reason we're here.",michael

17352,"Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.",michael

17438,"No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They're deformed, and they're abnormal, and... they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it, I can't... you know. There's just one of me, and there's a thousand of them. And rabies wins.",michael
17439,Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.,jim
17440,I'm still having a nice day.,pam
17441,You are?,jim
17442,"Yeah. Hey Michael, look at this lamp. $8.00.",pam
17443,That's a good deal.,michael
17444,"And Michael, you don't have rabies. And chances are you're not going to get it anytime soon. So... you don't really have to think about it too much.",pam
17445,"Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.",michael
17446,"Yeah, but there's other, better people out there who are helping.",pam
17447,"You just don't think I am capable, of making a difference.",michael
17448,"I know you Michael, I saw you naked.",pam
17449,"You don't, you don't know me. You've just seen my penis. I can make a difference, remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this... GD 5k [gets up groaning, Jim tries to help] No, no!",michael
17450,"Finishing that 5k, was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I ate more fettuccine alfredo and drank less water, than I have in my entire life. People always talk about triumphs of the human spirit, well today I had a triumph of the human body. That's why everybody was applauding for me at the end. My guts and my heart, and while I eventually puked my guts out, I never puked my heart out. And I'm very, very proud of that.",michael
17452,Hey Mer. How ya doing?,michael
17454,"It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.",michael
17456,"Thanks, I'm not mad at you anymore. [sighs, takes sucker out of his mouth] Wanna share?",michael
17458,"I'm not really sick. [Meredith takes a lick and hands back to Michael] Nah, I'm good.",michael
17459,Did you ever think of this?  Would a sober person walk in front of a car?,michael
17460,Ay-o!,andy
17461,"I'm sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?",jim
17462,Well...,michael
17464,Michael.,pam
17467,That's not...,michael
17469,"That's not what...no, no, I'm not saying that, that's disgusting.",michael
17471,Then... what are you saying?,andy
17472,I am saying... that... maybe I was drunk.  Did you ever think of that?,michael
17473,Definitely not.,jim
17476,Okay.,michael
17477,Maybe she hit me.  You ever think of that?  She hit me?  I don't know whose fault it was.  I wasn't exactly looking at the road.,michael
17478,"Hey, Toby. [walks past him to Kelly's cubicle]",pam
17480,"Kelly, we're going to visit Meredith at lunch.  [Kelly's lying down on floor, head unseen under desk.  She rolls to her side, away from Pam]  Kelly?",pam
17485,"You know what, why don't go around the room and say one memory of Meredith.  I'll start.  I liked her jumpers.  They reminded me of Kindergarten.  Jim?",michael
17487,"So, how's the view old girl?  [looking out windows]  Oh!  There's a cemetery.  You think that's affiliated with the hospital, or is it a like a separate feature...",andy
17488,"Hey! Okay, okay, okay,    You can just close that.",michael
17491,"Let's just... Why can't you just forgive... Why, why are you having such a hard time laughing this off?  How do you know that you weren't born with some sort of abnormal pelvis that it was just bound to crack at some point?",michael
17493,I'm not going to leave until you forgive me.,michael
17495,"[standing for a while, sighs, turns to walk out] Oh, okay.",michael
17499,This office is cursed.  [sighs]  And we need to do something about it.,michael
17500,Conference room?,jim
17501,"Maybe the conference room, maybe the annex.  I'm just saying, at least right here [indicates floor in front of his office] is cursed.  Conference room, 10 minutes.",michael
17502,"On the one hand, it's a relief to know that it's not just me, the whole office is cursed.  On the other hand, I may have to deal with the dark unknown.",michael
17503,Question: Has anyone recently offended a Gypsy?,dwight
17504,We have to have done something wrong.,michael
17506,"That was the curse, Stanley, and we are trying to find the cause of the curse.",michael
17507,Mmm.  [nods],dwight
17508,"Oscar, are you Santaria?",michael
17510,"Oh.  Great.  We have a secular humanist here, that is disgusting.",michael
17512,Yes.  It is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition.,michael
17514,Stupid.,michael
17515,"My cousin Mose's best friend was a dog.  One day, he was foaming at the mouth, so I had to shoot him dead.  Turns out, he had only eaten one of Mose's cream pies.  Did I feel bad for killing him?  No.  That's how you deal with a thief.",dwight
17516,"Yeah, the, uh, the charity's having some financial problems.  What do I look like to you, Paul Newman?  That's actually not a good example, because I have been compared to a young Paul Newman, my eyes and my face.  And I make my own salad dressing.  I mix Newman's Ranch with Newman's Italian.  Sell it at flea markets for a slight loss.  I could make... I could make a profit if I changed one of the ingredients to Wishbone [shakes head] but I won't do it.",michael
17517,"Whoa, 'scuse me!  Oh!",michael
17519,"Oh, slow!  Oh, ho, ho, ho. [laughing as he passes Phyllis and Bob]  You guys are going so slow...",michael
17521,"Come on, I'm going backwards.",michael
17523,"Oh, all right!  All right!  All right!  All right!",michael
17525,"Okay! [Bob Vance and Michael in an all-out sprint, Michael grunting]",michael
17527,Thanks.,michael
17530,"Well, apparently, my insurance will not be covering this hospital stay.  I will be paying out-of-pocket.  Um... I kinda wish I'd been hit by a car.",michael
17531,"Hey, doc?  You forgetting something? [pediatrician takes a lollypop from his pocket and gives it to Michael]  Thank you.",michael
17532,Hey.,pam
17533,Hey.,jim
17534,I gotcha one. [Pam hands over a grape soda to Jim],pam
17535,"Oh wow, thank you.",jim
17536,Yeah.,pam
17537,"I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some?",jim
17538,"No. Thanks... uh we're still having lunch today, right?",pam
17539,"I guess. [Pam smiles and walks away, then comes back and kisses Jim on the cheek] How dare you.",jim
17540,Hey Toby. What's this? [holds up memo Toby has passed out to the staff],michael
17542,[reads memo] I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.,michael
17544,Oh really.,michael
17546,"Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight...",michael
17550,[turns to address Jim and Pam] No way.,michael
17551,What?,dwight
17553,"Ummm... yup. Yes, we are.",jim
17554,Woooah! Wow!,michael
17555,Tuna!,andy
17556,Awesome!,michael
17558,You guys! Yes! Yes!,michael
17559,"Toby, was this your fun little way of congratulating us?",pam
17561,"Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here. [gestures to Pam to get up] Come on. Come here. Okay, okay, [to Jim] stand up. [Jim moves over in chair] OK, here we go. [holding both Pam and Jim's hand] Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one.",michael
17562,"Actually, we've been dating for a couple months.",jim
17563,"I love you guys, so much. [hugs Jim]",michael
17564,"Ohh.. [Michael goes to hug Pam, phone rings]",jim
17565,Phone's ringing. [goes back toward desk],pam
17566,"No, no, no Pam let 'em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is [starts to well up] really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.",michael
17567,I don't see it. I think they both could do better.,dwight
17569,Jim Halpert's off the market. Guess who just became the best looking single guy in the office?,andy
17570,Hey. Can you make that straighter? That's what she said.,michael
17572,"No. [tries to hide piece of paper, but Pam grabs it]",michael
17573,[reading from paper] Can you make that straighter? That job looks hard. You should put your mouth on that. How can you even use that one naturally?,pam
17574,Blowing up balloons I thought.,michael
17575,You might want to trim it a little.,pam
17578,"Yeah, he is.",pam
17580,Pam and Jim are together. Ryan is visiting. Only thing that could make this day better is ice cream.,michael
17582,To give you this [reveals a cat from under a coat].,dwight
17584,It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.,dwight
17586,And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage. [shakes cat] Don't you Garbage? [makes chomping noises],dwight
17588,You haven't buried her yet?,dwight
17590,"Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons. [holds cat towards Angela] Look at him.",dwight
17592,Hey Toby.,pam
17594,"Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company.",jim
17596,Oh.,jim
17597,"Well, I don't wanna speak for Jim, but, it's like pretty official. [Jim smiles]",pam
17599,"Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?",jim
17601,What?,jim
17603,"Oh, OK.",jim
17604,OK.,pam
17605,Great. [Jim and Pam walk away],jim
17606,[sees Ryan coming through door] Hey Ryan. Welcome back --,pam
17608,Hey!,michael
17609,Yeah.,pam
17610,"There he is! There he is! He's back! And he's with a beard. [laughing] He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I'm Tubs.",michael
17612,"Ohh, yeah, let's get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm..",michael
17614,...business meeting --,michael
17617,That's right! That's right!,michael
17619,"Fire guy. Don't start any fires, Ryan.",michael
17620,Fire guy [makes flames with his hands],andy
17622,Here for what?,andy
17624,"Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You're like our little man...",michael
17627,Beard.,michael
17630,"Oh, wow!",michael
17632,That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way.,michael
17634,Woooo![laughs] I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.,michael
17636,"Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let's get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in [looks at Ryan] 10 minutes?",michael
17638,"Sounds good. OK, alright.",michael
17639,"Yeah, Ryan snapped at me, but there was this twinkle in his eye that I picked up on, which said, 'Dude, we're friends. I'm doing this for appearances. I am the big boss now. And I have to seem like an ogre. But you know me and you trust me. And we like each other. And we'll always be friends. And I would never take you for granted in a million years. And I miss you, man. And I love you.' His words.",michael
17641,"Wait a second. Last time I checked, Dunder Mifflin already has a website. And quite frankly, I'm not really sure what's wrong with it. [Jim at his desk, showing the Dunder Mifflin website reading 'Under Construction. Coming Christmas 2002!']",jim
17643,"OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.",michael
17645,What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?,dwight
17647,Got it. [Andy's hand goes up],dwight
17649,"We should call it Dunder Mifflinfinity. You know, push the words together?",andy
17653,Ryan Howard everybody. [starts clapping] Good job. [everyone gets up to leave],michael
17658,Who is?,michael
17660,I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.,michael
17662,"Swore I wouldn't tell anyone this, but in the interest of revealing secrets. Oh my God, this will make your brain explode. Umm, Dwight and Angela dating. Have been for six months.",jim
17663,No.. [in awe],pam
17664,"Swear to God. [Pam shakes her head]. Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.",jim
17665,"No, they have been dating for like two years. [Jim in shock] Since before your barbeque.",pam
17666,Wait. What? [Pam nods her head] You knew? And you didn't say anything?,jim
17667,You didn't say anything to me?,pam
17668,Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.,jim
17669,Can you believe that...,pam
17671,"Oh no, we're just sitting here.",jim
17673,OK.,pam
17675,OK.,jim
17676,And... that is why we waited so long to tell people.,jim
17678,"Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?",michael
17680,"Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no?",michael
17682,"Good, so, we're on the same page?",michael
17684,"We had a foreign exchange student live with us when I was young. And we called him my brother. And that's who I thought he was. Um, then he went home to what is now formerly Yugoslavia, taking all of my blue jeans with him. And I had to spend the entire winter in shorts. That is what Ryan is like. A fake brother who steals your jeans.",michael
17708,Hello.,dwight
17710,Really?,dwight
17712,"I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.",dwight
17715,Hi.,pam
17717,In his office. You can go right in.,pam
17731,Hey.,michael
17733,"[holds up Blackberry] Hey, what is the actual deal with these things in terms of testicles?",michael
17735,I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.,michael
17737,"Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.",michael
17739,Well...,michael
17741,What is that... word?,michael
17743,So older people have just as many rights as younger people?,michael
17751,Michael told us to wait in here. We don't know why.,pam
17753,"Good, we're all here, we can get started.",michael
17755,Have a seat.,michael
17757,Have a seat. Like everybody else.,michael
17759,"Still my office, Ryan. [Ryan sits down] Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.",michael
17761,"Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?",michael
17763,"No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic. [points to her picture on the wall] Or the funny things that they can do, like 'where's the Beef?' [points to another picture on wall] [Jim raises his hand] Yeah.",michael
17764,"Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.",jim
17765,"Reusing the Ben Kingsley, too.",pam
17766,"I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.",michael
17767,Oh. [man enters conference room],pam
17769,"[puts hand up] That is me. Come on in. [They shake hands] Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh? [starts clapping, others join in]",michael
17770,"Oh, yeah. Yes!",dwight
17773,Sure thing. [both go out of conference room] 'Scuse me. [closes door],michael
17775,Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt. [they glare at each other],michael
17776,"Bob, how old are you?",michael
17778,"Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?",michael
17780,"Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.",michael
17781,"I'm gonna live for a very long time. My grandma Schrute lived to be 101. My grandpa Manheim is 103, and still puttering around in Argentina. I tried to go visit him once, but my travel visa was protested by the Shoah Foundation.",dwight
17783,Wow.,michael
17785,"Oh, boy.",michael
17787,Great.,michael
17789,Great.,michael
17791,That's great. Thank you for coming in. [starts ushering him out] Robert Dunder everybody. [clapping] Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?,michael
17793,Perfect. [starts closing the door],michael
17795,"Inspirational. What have we learned?  Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail. [Pam raises hand]",michael
17796,I think that I should help him get home.,pam
17797,"No, No. Don't help him. He doesn't need help, Pam. [Jim nods head and Pam gets up and leaves to help Robert Dunder, Michael shows Robert thumbs up] What a nice guy.",michael
17798,Good night guys. [staff leaves the office],michael
17800,"I disagree, I think it was very valuable.",michael
17802,I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.,michael
17807,Are you enjoying your vegetarian noodles?,dwight
17809,Dry. Delicious.,dwight
17811,"Oh, that's funny.",dwight
17813,Are you enjoying your mineral water?,dwight
17815,"Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here [points to middle of forehead above the eyes], it's an old sales trick.",dwight
17817,"No, please don't do this, monkey.",dwight
17820,Hi.,pam
17821,"Hey, Amy.  How ya doing?",jim
17822,Nice to meet you.,pam
17823,[under his breath] Nice to meet you.,jim
17831,"Whoa, Toby.  Watch out.  You're going to violate your own PDA memo.",pam
17833,Smell that. Do you smell that?,michael
17834,Dry rot?,dwight
17835,"No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.",michael
17836,"Mmhmm, sweet, chocolate turtles.",andy
17837,"Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. I'll explain, later.",michael
17838,"Ryan wants everything in our company to be about emails and IM's, but I think he's forgetting about the original instant message. Letters attatched to baskets of food.",michael
17839,"Excuse me, Angela. Michael asked me to turn in these reciepts for these gift basket items.",dwight
17841,You're welcome.,dwight
17843,Yes... [whispers] I miss you.,dwight
17846,Fine. [sighs] Then I just want to be friends.,dwight
17848,"Plus a little extra. Also, I love you.",dwight
17859,Hey.,jim
17860,Hey.,pam
17861,"Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?",jim
17862,It's funny you bring that up because yes it is.,pam
17863,"I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?",jim
17864,"I think... I mean, I don't know what it is but...",pam
17865,Be honest.,jim
17866,I now find you repulsive.,pam
17867,"That's honest. [sighs] Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?",jim
17868,Eh...,pam
17869,"For me, it was.",jim
17870,OK.,pam
17871,Alright.,jim
17872,"Hey boss, I didn't know you were coming in today.",michael
17874,"I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back.",michael
17876,"With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? That's what people like.",michael
17877,"Ever since I was a kid people have been telling me I can't do things. 'You can't be on the team', 'You can't move on to second grade'. Well, now they're telling me that I can't win back clients using old fashioned business methods. [shakes head] We'll see about that. And FYI, I eventually aced second grade, and I was the biggest kid in class.",michael
17878,"OK. We're gonna split up into teams. Jim, Phyllis. Stanley, Dwight. Me Andy.",michael
17880,I'll go with you Stanley.,andy
17882,Why don't we just go by ourselves?,jim
17883,Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?,michael
17885,Yes?,michael
17887,"OK, that's not helpful Phyllis.",michael
17889,"Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.",michael
17890,"What about cash? With cash you can buy anything you want, including a gift basket, so... it's kind of the best gift ever.",andy
17891,What about a gift basket full of cash?,jim
17892,Yes! Cash basket! Nice work Tuna.,andy
17893,"Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me. [walks toward the door]",michael
17894,"Michael, wait. Let me go.",dwight
17895,"No, this is my quest.",michael
17896,"Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back. [camera moves around and zooms in at Angela's face] Please.",dwight
17897,Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.,michael
17899,We don't need luck.,michael
17900,Yeah.,dwight
17901,"But thank you, that was really nice of you to say.",michael
17902,Thank you.,dwight
17903,"Business to business. The old fasioned way. No Blackberrys, no websites. I would like to see a website deliver baskets of food to people.",michael
17906,"[in Michael's car] Sweet ride, American made. What happened to the Sebring?",dwight
17907,It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.,michael
17908,"Ah, that's a pain in the ass.",dwight
17909,I know. So who's next?,michael
17910,Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.,dwight
17912,Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.,dwight
17913,Who?,michael
17914,"The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends. [sobs and then starts to cry]",dwight
17918,"Dude, you are so money, but you don't even know it, but you do.",andy
17921,Later man.,andy
17923,"Yeah, he's definitely something.",jim
17925,"That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?",jim
17926,Ha! Tuna... [inhales deeply] Tuna Tuna Tuna.,andy
17928,"He has a killer job, he's rich, he smells like what I think Pierce Brosnan probably smells like, he wears really cool rich guy clothes.",andy
17930,"So, sorry Tuna but if you don't know why that's awesome... then... you need awesome lessons.",andy
17932,"[places the gift basket on top of the table] Wow, those things are heavy! There's a lot of stuff in there. We have macadamia nut cookies, um, the honey mustard pretzels. Have you ever tried focaccia crisps?",michael
17934,Yes we do.,michael
17936,"Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you.",dwight
17937,Well...,michael
17938,"And we are dedicated to providing you with the very best customer service, the very best personal business relationship we can if you ever decide to come back to us.",dwight
17939,Mmhmm.,michael
17941,"Please, come back.",dwight
17942,"OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch.",michael
17943,Remember what we had Larry?,dwight
17945,"Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket.",michael
17947,Alright.,michael
17949,[driving] That guy was so... how can they not know how much better we are?,michael
17950,I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.,dwight
17951,That is true.,michael
17952,Like Angela in accounting.,dwight
17953,"Yes, she is nuts.",michael
17954,"Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.",dwight
17956,How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive.,michael
17958,Uh totally.,pam
17960,Yeah.,pam
17962,Thank you.,pam
17964,OK.,pam
17965,"Yeah, I'm gonna do some mock ups, and then turn those into thumbnails, maybe do some... splash frames. [laughs] I don't know what I'm talking about but I'm excited.",pam
17966,"And the last guy says 'No, hairy body'.",michael
17968,"Ah, well it's still very good. I bet I know someone who hasn't heard that joke... your daughter Emily. How's she doing?",michael
17970,"She's gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I don't want to take any more of your time, I know you're a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider.",michael
17972,"OK, OK! So you'll reconsider?",michael
17974,Ah... .is that all you have to say?,michael
17976,You don't know?,dwight
17977,"Look, we want you back.",michael
17979,"Well, no.",michael
17981,"He's not coming back, it's over Michael.",dwight
17982,No it's not.,michael
17984,"Accept it, why would he come back?",dwight
17985,"Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.",michael
17986,That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.,dwight
17987,"Look... we're also coming out with a website soon. It's a state of the art thing, it'll be up and running, it's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier.",michael
17989,"Great, the magic of the gift basket.",michael
17991,"OK, good. Don't let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, she's alergic.",michael
17993,"[in Michael's car] Well we're O for six. Last chance is the Elmhurst country club. Other side of the lake, on the southeast side.",dwight
17994,"I don't get it, I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing.",michael
17995,"That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.",dwight
17996,"That is a very good point, Dwight.",michael
17998,"Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.",dwight
17999,"No, it said right, it said take a right.",michael
18000,"No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.",dwight
18001,Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right. [turns right],michael
18002,It can't mean that! There's a lake there!,dwight
18003,The machine knows where it is going!,michael
18004,This is the lake!,dwight
18005,The machine knows--- stop yelling at me!,michael
18006,"No, it's--- there's no road here! [car drives into lake]",dwight
18007,"Remain calm! I have trained for this! [unfastens seat belt] Okay, exit the window! [Dwight and Michael exit through the window] Here we go! Look out for leeches! [swims toward Michael] Are you okay?! Swim for it! I got you! [Dwight grabs onto Michael while Michael opens the back door for the camera man] Michael! Michael!",dwight
18008,"Let go, let go of me!",michael
18009,"I got you, I got you! [Michael and Dwight reach the ground]",dwight
18010,[watching car get pulled from lake] You sure you're OK?,michael
18011,Fine.,dwight
18012,"Good, that is what's most important.",michael
18013,Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.,dwight
18014,"What a disaster, this whole thing.",michael
18015,I'll call a cab. [brings out cell phone],dwight
18016,"These people just don't realize what a gift basket means, they don't get it.",michael
18017,"Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone.",dwight
18018,"What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. 'I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy'. Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us.",michael
18019,"[speaking on the cell phone] Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.",dwight
18020,Hang up. [Dwight hangs up] You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket!,michael
18021,Yes!,dwight
18022,"We're gonna take what's rightfully ours! We're gonna take a stand, Dwight! We're gonna take a stand!",michael
18023,Take a stand!,dwight
18024,"So place it on the infinity thing without being obvious, you know? I'd love to do like a color version just to bring a little color to the logo.",pam
18026,Thanks.,pam
18028,That'd be great.,pam
18030,Oh... is it...,pam
18032,No...,pam
18034,Um...,pam
18036,"I'm uh, I'm dating Jim.",pam
18038,We're together.,pam
18040,"Yeah, great.",pam
18042,OK great!,pam
18044,Great.,pam
18045,I guess he can't get any girl he wants.,jim
18047,"Give it back. The gift basket, give it back.",michael
18049,"It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.",dwight
18051,"Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, let's leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches! [sits on couch]",michael
18052,"Can you call us a cab please, I'm gonna [gets water from his clothes on the couch] Oops, sorry!",dwight
18053,"Look, my clothes are so wet!",michael
18054,"Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy! [rubs shoes on couch]",dwight
18056,It's been opened.,michael
18058,What's missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles?,michael
18060,WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY?,michael
18061,"[enters nearby room] Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!",dwight
18063,[leaving] We'll bill you.,dwight
18064,"May I have your attention please? This office will not be using any new technology ever, starting now.",michael
18066,Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.,michael
18068,"I drove my car into a [bleep] lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me.",michael
18069,Into a lake.,jim
18070,Exactly!,michael
18072,"Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybody's lives. [looks at Ryan] Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game.",michael
18073,"Everyone always wants new things. Everybody likes new inventions, new technology. People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.",michael
18076,I know.  I love it there.,jim
18078,"Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.",jim
18080,Sounds great.,jim
18082,Yeee... (grunts in frustration),jim
18083,"Yes.  My old friend Ryan Howard is coming back today for some big presentation.  Very, very excited.  He is my protege.  He is someone that I hand-raised, that I nurtured.  Um... he is like a prime cut of veal whom I nourished with my milk.  And now he is also my boss.  So, win/win.",michael
18085,"Oh, Okay.  Okay.  Just...[Michael takes down banner, clears throat]  Well, our old friend Ryan Howard is back, and we're going to give a little presentation about the future of our company.  So please listen up. [awkward pause] All right.",michael
18087,You don't want me to help?,michael
18089,Yes?,michael
18091,I got it.,pam
18093,"[laughs] Um... yes, I'll be right back!",michael
18095,"That was slightly harsh, don't you think?",jim
18097,"I think I know what's going on.  Ryan believes that there is some sort of special 'boss water' that he gets to drink now.  And there isn't.  But, um... don't tell him.  Don't tell him that.  I don't want to jeopardize our friendship.",michael
18098,Ryan is causing some problems.  And you were always good at handling him.  What should I do to control him?,michael
18100,"I know, I know, no, what... something else.",michael
18102,Uh-huh.,michael
18104,Good.,michael
18106,My generation's all about hard work and accomplishment.  Like... the moon landing.  Or Vietnam.  Rolling Stones.  Greatest band ever.,michael
18108,"And still rockin', Oscar.  One of the greatest all-time oldies was a little Oriental guy named Confucius.  He literally invented the ancient Chinese secret.  Here's some of his quotes.  Confucius say, 'Man who farts in church must sit in his own pew.'  Confucius say, 'Man with hand in pocket feel cocky all day.'  Confucius also say, 'Virgin like balloon.  One prick, all gone!'",michael
18110,"No, I skipped through all of the boring stuff and went right to his joke page.  Which proves that he was old, but he was also hilarious.",michael
18112,I'm not.  It's solitaire.  See?,michael
18113,BlackBerry.  Why would anyone name something like this after a fruit?  You wouldn't name an iPod after a fruit.  [drops BlackBerry on desk]  Excuse me while I type on my Banana.  I'm gonna go to the Orange store and buy an Apricot computer.  [thinks] Apple. [nods],michael
18114,This is going on the outside.  The pipe cleaner needs to go through the corner.  Do not tape those on.,michael
18115,"Hey, Michael.",pam
18116,Mmhmm.,michael
18117,Jan called and asked where you're going to meet for dinner.  She wants you to call her.,pam
18118,I'm a little busy right now.  Could you BlackBerry me a message?,michael
18119,Sure.,pam
18120,"Michael doesn't know how to work his BlackBerry.  So when he says BlackBerry me a message, he means write it on a Post-it note and stick it to his BlackBerry.",pam
18122,"You didn't set up your BlackBerry, Dwight?",jim
18123,"Yes, I did, but I do not intend to use it.  It is pointless technology.",dwight
18124,As opposed to...,jim
18125,Printing press.  Tractor.  Mechanical thresher.  Telephone.  Airplane.  The only inventions that matter.,dwight
18126,What about cars?,jim
18127,They fall under the category of airplanes.,dwight
18128,"They do?  So, cars are flightless airplanes.",jim
18129,Correct.,dwight
18130,Got it.  They're like the penguins of the airplane family.,jim
18131,That's an excellent analogy.,dwight
18132,Thanks.,jim
18133,"Hey, Dwight, what about vaccines?",pam
18134,[scoffs] Vaccines are for chumps!,dwight
18135,My mom didn't believe in vaccines.  I got my smallpox the old-fashioned way.  And I survived.  So... joke's on you hospitals.,dwight
18136,"[Creed is using the toaster as a mirror, and touching up his hair with a Sharpie and a comb] The one advantage to being older is that I know a few things about a few things, and I am young enough to not forget them.  And old enough to know the difference between the two.  I am old enough to take advantage of age discrimination laws, but young enough to date college girls.  But old enough to know better.  I'm at a perfect age.  I could die now.  But I won't, because I am young.",michael
18147,"And the same thing goes for quarterly reports.  They are unreadable.  They're just numbers and boring and blech.  So what I was thinking is that maybe we should have some sort of graphic, like if we have a bad quarter, put in a storm cloud? And... when we have a good quarter, fireworks? Or a racecar?

18148,"There's this cube on the screen, and it bounces around all day, and sometimes it looks like it's heading right into the corner of the screen, and at the last minute it hits a wall and bounces away.  And we are all just dying to see it go right into the corner.  Pam claims that she saw it one day when she was alone in the conference room. Okay.  I believe she thinks she saw it.",jim
18149,"I saw it.  I saw it, and it was amazing!  Who said I didn't see it?  Did Jim say that I didn't see it? I saw it!",pam

18151,Dah!  Come on!,andy
18152,Yeah!  I know.  I know.  It's bland.,michael
18155,"Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?",michael
18156,[to Pam] Wait for it.,jim

18159,[everyone gets up and leaves the conference room] Alright. Alright.  Let's quit while we're ahead.,michael
18161,That was awesome. Thank you.,michael
18162,Some days I am just on fire.  What can I say?,michael
18164,"Hey Meredith, how you feelin'?",jim
18166,"Oh, please, it was my pleasure.  Well we all came, so...",jim
18168,Haha...,jim

18172,MmmHmm...,jim
18174,Oh yeah.,jim
18176,Alright...,jim
18177,Michael? This is the press release I was telling you about.  Ryan wants you to share it with everyone.,pam

Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people.  On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave.  Thank you.",michael

18182,And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.,michael
18183,"Well the website is the brain-child of my brain-child, Ryan.  It is my brain-grandchild. And, uh, to celebrate it's birth, all of the different branches are going to have satellite parties, which will be connected via web-cams and fibers to the real party, which is going on in New York City at uh, a very exclusive nightclub, and that is where all of the VIP's, including yours truly, will be partying with uh New York City's finest, and I do not mean policemen...",michael
18184,"The company is projecting record high sales, and that by 6:00 the website will be the new best salesman in the company.  Wow!  Watch out Dwight.",michael
18185,That's ridiculous.  I'm not going to be beaten by a website.,dwight
18186,Actually it sounds like you are.,jim
18187,Really?  'Cause Ryan says so?,dwight
18189,No.  It doesn't.  I'll find out tonight.,michael
18191,"I can make more sales than a computer.  In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.",dwight
18193,"What's that, pipsqueak?",michael
18195,You believe a computer can beat me?,dwight
18197,Well I will prove you wrong.,dwight
18199,We'll see.,dwight
18201,Dwight mercy killed Angela's cat.  It's very complicated.  It's caused a lot of unpleasantness between Dwight and Angela.  Who are both already prone to unpleasantness.,pam
18207,And this is where I will record your sales.,andy
18208,Hmm.  Very nice.  Very nice.,dwight
18209,"And then I will say something positive, like kudos or job well done.",andy
18210,Or zipadeedoodaah.,jim
18211,I can't tell if he's mocking me.,andy
18212,Just ignore him.,dwight
18213,"Ehh, can't do that.  Really hard for me to let things go.",andy
18214,I was... mocking.,jim
18215,Thank you.,andy
18216,I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.,dwight
18217,Yes like a chime or a bell...,andy
18218,Or a gong.,jim
18219,Go to my car.  Open the trunk.  Inside you will see many pelts.  Under the smallest one is a case.  Inside that case is a bear horn.  Bring it to me.,dwight
18220,Yes!,andy

18242,Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.,dwight
18243,What?,jim
18244,He's going through a break-up.,pam

18249,What if I told you I could offer free shipping?  Sure.  I'll hold.,dwight
18251,[on monitor] You tell me.,dwight
18252,[dictating to Pam] Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.,jim
18254,[on monitor] How do I know this isn't Jim?,dwight
18256,It appears that the website has become alive.  This happens to computers and robots sometimes.  Am I scared of a stupid computer?  Please.  The computer should be scared of me!  I have been salesman of the month for 13 out of the last 12 months.  You heard me right.  I did so well last February that Corporate gave me 2 plaques in lieu of a pay raise.,dwight

18380,"Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.",jim
18381,No.,michael
18382,Yep.,jim

18384,"Are there, uh, three w's at the beginning of the address?",jim
18385,Yes.,michael
18386,Yep.,jim
18387,"Well the invitation says VIP's only.  Is this how you treat your VIP's, Ryan?  We're already in the city.  The main part with the buildings.  What am I supposed to do?  What do you want me to do tonight?  And if you tell me, that I have to drive back to Scranton, to the satellite party, I am going to throw up!  Okay I'm going to throw up.  I'm throwing up.  You're making me throw up, Ryan.",michael
18388,You know what this is like?  I'll tell you what this is like. This is like when the Freshmen would throw a party and wouldn't let any of the Seniors go.,michael
18389,Doesn't it just piss you off sometimes that that little twerp got the promotion over us?,michael
18390,Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.,jim
18391,Yeah.  I withdrew too.,michael
18392,Four!  Three!  Two!  One!,andy

18411,Alright who wants to party?,michael
18413,"Ohhh, what?  Oh I think I faked Oscar out.",michael
18415,I think I faked Stanley out too.  Who else thought that I was leaving?  And they could all go home early?  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Well who needs New York?  Right?  We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.,michael
18417,Nope nope nope no.  This is going to be nothing like the party you've been planning.  This is going to be good and everybody's gonna come.  What's wrong with Dwight?,michael
18418,He beat the computer.,andy
18419,Oh hey!  Good for you.  Good for you.  Scranton power.  Alright you know what?  Angela I'd like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on.  Good.,michael
18420,"This was a pretty disappointing day.  It was kind of a slap in the face to realize that I wasn't as important as I thought I was to a certain young executive who I cared about.  But, you know, I'm not gonna cry over it.  I did that in the car on the way home.",michael
18421,How we doing on time?,michael
18423,Good.  These are some things that I would like to have happen.,michael
18425,Mmmhmm.,michael
18427,Those are just things.  This is how I want it to feel.,michael

18431,Yes,michael
18433,Uh...,michael
18435,I want it...,michael
18437,"I want it to embarrass all other parties.  I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, 'Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?'",michael
18439,Yes you can.,michael
18441,Yes you can.  I know you can.  I wouldn't say that if I didn't hundred percent believe it.  Who else could do this?,michael
18443,No seriously.  Is there anyone else who could do it better?  Because we don't have a lot of time.  I'll get the pizza!,michael
18444,What do you think of Angela?,andy
18445,I think she's efficient.,dwight

18448,You hadn't noticed she's a woman?,andy
18449,[impatient sigh],dwight
18450,"I hear she's single and ready to mingle.  I'm thinking about making a play for her.  What do you think?  Crazy, right?",andy
18451,I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with.,dwight

18453,No.  I think you should date Kelly.,dwight
18454,"She works here too, how is that any different?",andy

18456,[raised eyebrows] Okay.,andy
18457,Good news.,michael
18459,"Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?",michael
18462,Same thing.,michael
18465,You know what?  I don't understand when you all talk at the same time.,michael
18468,Pizza by Alfredo.,michael

18492,"Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.",michael
18494,"Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.",michael
18496,You didn't actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?,michael
18498,"Okay, it doesn't say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it's policy, it should say it on the coupon.",michael
18500,[sarcastic shrugging of shoulders] What do you mean hmm-um?,michael
18502,"It is your problem.  That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off.  End of story.",michael
18504,I'm not giving that to you.,michael
18506,"No, no you're not going anywhere.  You're staying here until we figure this out.",michael
18508,"You know what?  This young man needs to learn that's not how you treat people.  I don't care if it's pizza.  Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through.  You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you?  Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room.  Right now, get in the conference room.",michael
18510,"Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza.  Please, thank you.",michael

18523,"Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?",michael
18525,We're a paper company.  The best paper company in the whole wide world.,dwight
18526,"Alright, Dwight, knock it off.  You better think about what you are doing young man.",michael
18528,"No!  I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything.  You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot shot, and you don't know anything about sales.  So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?",michael
18530,"Yeah sales, you sell pizza.  Last time I checked that's called sales.",michael
18532,What did you just call him?,dwight
18534,What did you say?,dwight
18536,"Alright stop, stop making him say it!  You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.",michael
18537,"I can make him talk, Michael.",dwight
18539,Stop talking all at once!,michael
18540,You need to let him go.,jim
18541,Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?,michael
18542,Yes.,jim
18543,"You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.",michael
18544,"Yes, but not by kidnapping.",jim
18545,"I'm not kidnapping him, I'm keeping him until I get what I want.",michael
18546,As a hostage.,jim
18547,I think you're over-thinking it.,michael
18548,I think you're under-thinking it.,jim
18549,"Yes, is Alfredo there?  Can I speak to a manager then?  Okay, can you tell the manager that I'm keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered.  Yes, I know it is not on the coupon.  Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our...",michael
18550,Ransom.,jim
18551,"Trouble.  Okay, alright.",michael
18552,What did he say?,jim
18553,He said no.,michael

18555,"No, no.",michael
18556,Okay.,jim
18557,"Listen up kid.  [pops balloon with his hands]  I don't like you, but because some town in Switzerland says so, you have rights.",dwight
18560,Hey!,dwight
18562,Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.,jim
18563,"Mister Overdramatic, what's up Kevin?",michael
18568,"Here you are my dear, one thing made of ice.",andy
18570,"It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor.",dwight

18578,I'll just wave and introduce myself.,michael
18579,"Hey, quick question.  If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?",jim
18580,I'm all over it.,pam
18581,Okay.,jim
18582,What have we got here?,jim
18584,"Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?",jim
18586,Which one's this? Perfect.,jim
18587,"Do you remember what you said to me on my first day of work, just before you walked me over to my desk?",jim
18588,"Yeah, enjoy this moment, because you're never going to go back to this time before you met your desk mate Dwight.",pam
18589,And that's when I knew. You?,jim
18590,"You came up to my desk, and said, this might sound weird, and there's no reason for me to know this, but that mixed berry yogurt you're about to eat has expired.",pam
18591,That was the moment that you knew you liked me?,jim
18592,Yep.,pam
18593,"Wow, can we make it a different moment?",jim
18594,Nope.,pam
18597,"Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that [bleep]hole.",michael
18601,You said your upper back itched.,andy
18603,"Look Angela, I know this is weird because we work together, and up until and possibly now I've repulsed you, but I like you.",andy
18605,"So, Angela is stubborn as a mule, she's giving off fairly strong vibes that she's not interested.",andy
18606,[smiles],dwight
18607,"But do I like her or not, because if I like her, then I can't back down.",andy

18611,Ahh-chaa!,dwight
18612,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?",michael
18613,I'm just scaring him.  The trick is to make him think you're going to do something to him.,dwight
18615,"Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat!",dwight
18616,"Hey, hey, hey stop it.  Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no.  I kidnapped a kid.",michael
18617,"You had to, what other choice did you have?",dwight
18618,I could have paid for the pizza.,michael
18619,"Well, yeah.",dwight
18620,"Oh my God, oh my God.",michael
18621,This is Michael.,michael
18623,You're breaking up. I can't hear you.,michael
18625,"[to Dwight] Mmm-kay.  I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.",michael
18626,What will you do?,dwight
18627,I will open the door.,michael
18628,Yeah.,dwight
18629,"And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.",michael
18630,"So, I'm paying full price?",dwight
18631,Yes.,michael
18632,"Here we go, sixty-five.  You know what?  There's two more.",dwight
18633,"See ya, drive safely.",michael
18634,[pizza guy flips him off] Okay.,michael
18635,Now what?,dwight
18636,"Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.",michael
18637,"Alright.  Oh, I assume I'm going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.",dwight

18677,Later on.,dwight
18678,"[mocking Ryan] I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would, because it didn't work out for me, and I'm very embarrassed.  I got egg all over my face.",michael

18692,[Dwight come into office unshaven]  What?,dwight
18693,Well it's just that you had no hair on Friday.,jim
18694,It's called being a man.  You should try it sometime.,dwight
18695,How long have you been a man?,jim
18696,"I was born a man, Halpert.",dwight
18697,That must have been extremely uncomfortable for your mom.,jim
18698,"I stopped shaving because my girlfriend broke up with me.  Am I in pain?  Hell, yeah.  But I'll tell you something, I thrive in pain.  I love pain.  To me, pain is not pain at all.  No.  It is pure pleasure.  And I hate pleasure.  Almost as much as I love pain.  So, yeah, I'm in pain.",dwight
18699,[to Dwight] What do you think of Angela?  There's just something about her.  All that strength and steeliness and righteousness all wrapped up tight and shoved into a tiny little delicate frame.,andy
18700,"No.  I will not be playing it 'cool' [makes air quotes] with Angela.  Let me tell you a little story.  When I was seventeen, I was waitlisted at my number one school.  Even though I was a legacy, and I had like a thousand extra-curriculars, mostly drama, madrigals, barbershop club, I was waitlisted.  Did I wait, on that list?  No, I did not.  I busted into the admissions office and I [singing] sang them all the reasons they should admit me to the school [end singing].  And guess what?  I.  Got.  In.  And here's the kicker.  That school?  Cornell.",andy
18701,What's wrong with me?,michael
18702,Excuse me?,pam

18704,Sometimes your laziness borders on incompetence.,pam
18705,"What, no.  No.  Okay, bags.  I have bags under my eyes, Pam.  I didn't see it at home, I didn't see it in the bathroom, I didn't see it on any of the city mirrors, but in this light...",michael
18706,"[interrupting] The city mirrors, or the...?",pam
18707,"The big, free mirrors that the city puts up, on trees and telephone poles?  The big round things.",michael
18708,The ones for drivers to check their blind spots?,pam
18709,"Yes.  I have bags under my eyes, and I can't go to New York like this!  What do I do?  What do I do?",michael

18716,"[tea bags on eyes] Do I feel badly, that nobody out there was invited to a party that I was invited to?  Not at all.  Because they have to know that if they work hard and apply themselves, someday, they could be invited to a party like this.  Of course, at that point, I will be going to much better parties that they will not be able to get into.  What are you gonna do?",michael
18727,"Hey.  The way I see it, it's getting late, and the only thing standing between you and a warm bed is my friend's pizza discount.  So whattaya say?  [pizza guy stares]  Oh, so that's how it's gonna be.  Well, I can stay here all night if I have to.  I've done it before.",dwight

18751,Like the main company number? Because I'm gonna have to call information.,pam

18769,No--- don't... that doesn't even mean anything.,michael
18771,"Yes. Money has been a little tight lately. But, at the end of my life, when I'm sitting on my yacht, am I gonna be thinking about how much money I have? No. I'm going to be thinking about how many friends I have, and my children, and my comedy albums. I mean, I have a yacht, so I obviously did pretty well money wise.",michael

18824,Where are you going out tonight?,jim
18825,You wouldn't understand. It's a secret.,michael
18826,I wouldn't understand or a secret?,jim
18827,"You wouldn't understand, Jim. It's a secret.",pam
18828,"I'm sorry Mr. O'Brian, I didn't mean to interrupt your dinner. I just have a very exciting offer. My records indicate that you have expressed interest in losing some weight. Well, what if I told you that I have a pill that will make you 50 pounds lighter in 5 minutes? How does that sound? Amazing right? Well, it won't be that fast, but it will--[notices camera]-- it will be that easy.",michael
18829,"I can't believe this place is real. I mean, I've heard about his beet farm for years, but wow.",jim

18831,"The Beets Motel? That is, wow.",jim
18832,Thank you. Eh. The Embassy Beets. Radishon!,pam
18833,How are you doing this?,jim
18834,I don't know! [Mose starts running by the left side of the car],pam
18835,Oh my gosh.,pam
18836,"I just love sales. I love it to death. It's as simple as that. And I don't get to do it enough as a manager, so I took this second job. I count it as a hobby. Some people have golf, or relaxing.",michael
18838,"Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call.",michael
18840,"No, they're with me, so... this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars!",michael

18843,"American, Irrigation, and Night-Time.",dwight
18844,Irrigation.,pam
18845,Nice.,jim

18847,Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.,jim
18848,No.,dwight

18850,"No. Jim, come on.",dwight
18852,"Mose, bags! Now!",dwight
18853,"Here we are, the Irrigation Room! A very special room. So I'll come get you before the table-making demonstration. And as of this morning, we are completely wireless here in Schrute Farms.

18855,These meetings are useless.,michael
18857,Very inspirational. [laughter],michael
18860,Or a trained seal. [laughter],michael
18862,"Hmmm, I'd say 1 in 6.",jim
18863,What?,pam
18864,"Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.",jim
18865,"You know, I've just realized, this is Pam's and my first night away together. I use to play it over my head, and it was just a little bit different. Maybe a uh, nice hotel. Or a romantic dinner. Wine... uh but, wine that wasn't made out of beets. Didn't think Dwight would be involved at all. And uh, I always imagined less manure. I mean, some manure, just... less.",jim
18866,"Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!",dwight
18867,"Yes, is Mr. Hudson there?",michael

18875,[speaking with a different voice] Have you--- Have you considered satellite television?,michael
18878,Well your son sounds like he's really motivated. I think it's crazy the coach won't play him frankly.,michael
18880,You bet.,michael
18882,"Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes---",michael
18884,It is not a waste of our time.,michael

18891,"[reading to Jim, Pam, and Mose] And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand, and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger. Saw the frail old man on the floor write in agony. 'Harry?' It was over quickly as it had come. Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate in the garden, his heart racing.",dwight
18892,What did you get tonight?,michael
18894,"Oh, that looks good.",michael
18896,I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.,michael
18898,Thank you.,michael
18900,Really?,michael
18902,Wonder what I would've been back home?,michael
18904,"I know, but it's competitive here. What's a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.",michael
18906,I would've been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy.,michael
18907,"[Jim and Pam hear noise] Wait, you're going up there?",jim
18908,Yeah. Coward.,pam
18909,[Pam sees Mose in an outhouse] Oh my God. What century is this?,pam
18910,"You know what, here's the thing about Die Hard 4. Die Hard one, the original, John McClane was just this normal guy. You know, he's just a normal New York City cop, who gets his feet cut, and gets beat up. But he's an everyday guy. In Die Hard 4, he is jumping a motorcycle into a helicopter. In air. You know? He's invincible. It just sort of lost what Die Hard was. It's not Terminator.",michael
18912,I actually wrote a movie.,michael
18914,"I'm writing one, yeah.",michael
18916,"Um, sort of a spy, thriller...",michael
18918,"[Pam and Jim hear Dwight crying] Ugh, your turn.",pam

18922,Does Mose have nightmares?,jim
18923,Oh yes. Ever since the storm.,jim
18924,Is everything satisfactory with your stay?,dwight
18925,"Yeah, yeah.",jim
18926,Great.,dwight
18927,"Just thought that I heard crying, moaning, or something in here.",jim
18928,Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.,dwight

18951,Pam.,dwight
18952,You okay?,jim
18953,I am better than you have ever been or ever will be. [Ryan walks in],dwight
18956,Um... that wasn't much of an introduction.,michael
18958,"Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we're gonna be talking... about...PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!",michael
18959,"Yes I forgot about Ryan's presentation. And yes, it would have been nice to do well with the first presentation he had given me. But you know what else would have been nice? Winning the lottery.",michael
18960,"And the best way to start is to hit start. And up comes the toolbar, that's what she said. What we have to do here is go to Run, and then you look up to PowerPoint. And we are in. We are going to register. You hit register--- Updates are ready. I should update. Um, estimated time 12 minutes, so this should take 5 or 10 minutes.",michael
18962,Why?,michael
18964,"No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.",michael
18966,"My other boss, Mr. Figaro.",michael

18969,Are you a cocktail waitress?,jim
18971,It won't.,michael
18973,"Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways. [Kelly laughs]",michael
18985,"Why don't you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?",michael
18987,"Huh, okay.",michael
18989,"It's whoever, not whomever.",michael
18991,"No, whomever is never actually right.",michael

19007,How did he use it again?,pam
19009,Thank you.,michael
19011,"No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.",michael
19013,"I've never done this before. I've never quit anything in my life.  So, you are filming history.",michael
19014,"Nick, I had a dream last night that I had two full time jobs.  One here at the Lipophedrazone diet pill company---",michael
19016,And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin.,michael
19018,"In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me.  But the truth is, I can't do this.",michael
19020,I am.,michael
19022,"I was never in this for the money.  But it turns out that the money was an absolute necessity for me.  I tried to live the dream.  I tried to have a job, a girlfriend, another job, and I failed.  But the good thing about the American dream is that you can just go to sleep, and try it all again the next night.",michael
19023,So.,andy
19024,What's up?,pam
19025,Me.  All night.  Dreaming about Angela's smoking hot body.,andy
19026,You're being gross.,pam
19027,"Not from a male perspective.  You need to set me up with her, I know she told you that she's looking, and she's totally not responding to my moves.",andy
19028,What moves?,pam
19029,I have moon-walked past accounting like ten times.,andy
19030,I can't believe that's not working.,pam
19031,Yeah.,andy
19032,"Um, I don't know if I really see you two together.",pam
19033,"Really?  Well, maybe you should look in the smart part of your brain.",andy
19034,She's very religious.,pam
19035,"Okay, well I come from a line Wasps so long it leads back to Moses.",andy
19036,"Okay, well she takes her convictions pretty seriously, she can be kind of severe.",pam
19037,"Yeah, and I punched a hole in a wall.",andy
19038,"That's right, you did.",pam
19039,Yeah.,andy
19040,"Now that I think about it, Angela and Andy might actually make a good couple.  But I couldn't do that to Dwight... or Angela... or Andy.",pam
19041,"Hey Kevin, you're a gambler right?  A rounder, you play the ponies, small horses.",michael
19043,"Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself.  You know, just a little bit of money.  Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times.  I don't know, kind of just for fun.  I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things.  Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something.  Like, who do I call about that?",michael
19045,Do you know anybody in the mob?,michael
19047,"Okay, um, Oscar, I'm going to need to take another advance on my salary.",michael
19060,Hey guys.,michael
19062,"What'cha talking about?  [camera pans to each face in the break room]  Okay, I know what's going on.  You're talking about Jim and Pam, if they're having sex, what it looks like, I know, I think---",michael
19063,Michael.,pam
19064,"Hey, hey, hey.",michael
19066,"Monkey problem? No, I'm not having monkey problems.  Why would I have monkey problems?",michael
19068,"Oh, I hate monkeys.",michael
19069,"What's going on, why do you have a second job?",pam
19070,I don't have a second job.  Maybe I'm having an affair with Suzanne Summers.,michael
19071,Doesn't Jan have money?,pam
19072,"I don't talk to my girlfriend about money.  It is rude, and unsexual.",michael
19074,"I totally agree with you.  But I don't have money problems, I don't.  Alright, you know what?  Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this? [Michael holds up a bill, crumples it up, puts it back in his pocket]",michael
19076,"Yeah, but I destroyed it, it's not even useable anymore.",michael
19085,No you didn't.,michael
19088,"How would that help Creed?  In Monopoly when you go bankrupt, you lose.",michael
19090,That is a good point.,michael
19092,Like the witness protection program.,michael
19095,"I've always wanted to be in the witness protection program.  Fresh start, no debts, no baggage.  I've already got my name picked out, Lord Rupert Everton.  I'm a shipping merchant who raises fancy dogs.  That's the life.",michael
19096,I... DECLARE... BANKRUPTCY!,michael
19098,"I didn't say it, I declared it.",michael
19101,"Yeah, tell me about it.",michael
19103,"You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she's using them as if I'm made of money, she thinks I'm a human ATM machine.",michael
19105,"Oh, that's the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.",michael
19107,"That is by far the best way to strengthen your core.  This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist.  It strengthens your entire core.  Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it.  I think that's how they got a core.",michael
19108,"I left a little present for Angela.  I think she's going to like it, because I found it outside of Vance Refrigeration all alone, and I told her in the note that the cat came to find her, that they were destined to be together.  I got game.",andy
19110,Mm-hm.  That is so cool how you have my name at the top.,michael
19112,Right.,michael
19114,How do they do this so fast?  Is this power-point?,michael
19115,"Man, Angela really had a hold on him. [Dwight playing the recorder in the background]  Angela.",pam
19117,"No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this.",michael
19119,"We will find another way, we'll ask power-point.",michael
19121,You're a presentation tool if you think I'm gonna tell Jan about this.,michael
19123,"No you're not! Ok, just... you're not a tool. Look, we'll tell her that it's bad, but it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half.",michael
19125,She poses.,michael
19126,"Dwight, how's the hotel business?",jim
19127,Stupid.,dwight
19128,Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?,jim
19129,No.,dwight
19130,Maybe you should.,jim
19131,Maybe you should.  Whatever.,dwight
19132,"We wrote a good review.  Under comments, we wrote, the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedroom and makes you dream of simpler times.",pam

19134,Table making never seemed so possible.,pam
19135,You will never want to leave your room.,jim

19137,I'm glad you enjoyed your stay.,dwight
19138,We really did.  It was fun.,pam
19141,"Um, that's, how did you get that from what Oscar's saying?",michael
19151,"What am I doing? I am blowing dodge. I'm getting out of town. Whatever you call it, I am running away from my responsibilities. And it feels good.",michael
19153,Dwight.,pam
19154,Uhh-mmm [moaning],dwight
19155,Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?,jim
19156,[incoherent mumbling] No you didn't.,dwight
19157,"Yeah, I didn't think I had.  Well, it was all about Pam.",jim
19158,Mmm-uh-mm [incoherent mumbling],dwight
19159,"Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it.  I mean, I lost it Dwight.  I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything.  Even weird stuff, like food had no taste.  So my solution was to move away.  It was awful.  It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.",jim
19160,"[sobbing, reaches out to Jim after he walked away]",dwight
19161,"Hey, I was thinking about dinner--- [Jim grabs her face and kisses her]",pam
19162,"Ah, dinner.  Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.",jim
19163,Okay.,pam
19164,Yeah?,jim
19165,Yeah.,pam
19166,Okay.,jim

19191,Don't sell your implants please.,michael
19193,That's nice though.,michael
19195,It looks cute though.,michael
19196,I used to get offers in the mail for credit cards all the time.  They would say things like 'don't pay for six months' or 'you can transfer your account from another card'...,michael

19224,I can't.,michael
19226,I can't go back to that.,michael

19327,"All right, good, well this is what we have to work with.",michael
19328,I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'Nard Dog. Who let the 'Nard Dog out?,michael
19329,Hoo hoo hoo-hoo!,andy
19330,He gives the best back rubs in the office.,michael
19331,"It's true, I give a mean backrub. I also do good aromatherapy [makes farting noise]. Not! You just got 'Nard dogged!",andy
19332,Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.,michael
19334,Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.,michael
19335,"These are our accountants. And as you can see they are very different sizes. What you might want to do is kind of a Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear thing. That might be kind of fun.",michael
19337,Who else?,michael
19338,"I think it's great that the company's making a commercial because not very many people have heard of us. I mean, when I tell people that I work at Dunder Mifflin, they think that we sell mufflers, or muffins, or mittens, or... And frankly all of those sound better than paper, so I let it slide.",jim
19339,You playing that game again?,jim
19340,"Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers.",dwight
19341,Oh it has losers.,jim
19342,I signed up for Second Life about a year ago. Back then my life was so great that I literally wanted a second one. In my Second Life I was also a paper salesman and I was also named Dwight. Absolutely everything was the same. Except I could fly. [shot of Dwight's avatar flying around],dwight
19343,"[reading off piece of paper] Little girl in a field holding a flower, we zoom back to find that she's in the desert and the field is an oasis. Zoom back further the desert is a sandbox in the world's largest resort hotel. Zoom back further the hotel is actually the playground for the world's largest prison.  But we zoom back further---",michael
19345,"Actually I don't get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so...",michael
19347,"Yeah, I know.",michael
19349,"Mmm. Okay. [commercial plays on laptop, peppy music in background]",michael
19350,That's what Nassau came up with? That sucks! [chuckles] Whoa.,michael
19352,Well we can do better than that.,michael
19355,The waving?,michael
19357,"I need some advice. I've been spending a lot of time making out with Angela lately. But we've been necking, but only necking.  Right? Not actually kissing, our mouths, just the neck on neck. It's just like rubbing slash nuzzling our necks together. It's hot, I'm not going to lie to you , but it's a little weird, but you seem like a guy with answers, so how do I fast track this to get to first base?",andy
19358,"We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us.",dwight
19359,We'll use code names.,andy
19360,"Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight.",dwight
19361,That's not different enough.,andy
19362,Dwike?,dwight
19365,"[on speakerphone, Eddie Murphy voice] Shrek! Shrek, I'm a donkey! I'm a donkey, Shrek! [laughing] I'm just kidding. It's me. Hello Ry.",michael
19367,"Okay, calm down. I have a small problem.",michael
19369,"Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.",michael
19371,"I'm creative, Ryan.",michael
19373,"Well actually I can't cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike's Cereal Shack. I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.",michael
19375,Yeah!,michael
19377,"Are you? I don't think you're doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.",michael
19378,"All right, let me ask you this, tell me if you think this is creative. When I was five, I imagined that there was such a thing as a unicorn. And this is before I had even heard of one, or seen one. I just drew a picture of a horse that could fly over rainbows, and had a huge spike in its head. And I was five, five years old. Couldn't even talk yet.",michael
19379,"Hey guys, um, you know what, we cannot shoot this ad today.",michael
19381,"How about never hundred hours, sir.",michael
19384,Hey thanks. Thank you.,michael
19386,"Yeah, I'm glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again.",michael
19388,"What's up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it's ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we'll do it on my dime.",michael
19390,I'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it.,michael
19392,"Okay. [hangs up phone] And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way.",michael
19393,"Has anyone ever come up to you and said, 'You're not creative'?",michael
19394,Yes.,dwight
19395,"Well they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.",michael
19396,"Who are you talking to, specifically?",jim
19400,"We have three scenes to film, big scenes. We have a song to write. So let's get cracking. Kelly, I want you to do makeup. Oscar, I would like you to do costume design, obviously.  Phyllis, I'd like you look around town and see if we have any celebrities in our local area.",michael
19402,"Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.",michael
19404,"Does anyone actually know what Sue Grafton looks like? I mean, is she hot or-?",andy
19406,Well then maybe we should just use Angela and say she's Sue Grafton. Would anyone notice?,andy
19410,Line it up Phyllis.,michael
19418,"Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought... I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.",michael
19420,"Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I'll make you a mix.",michael
19422,News flash. I got some juicy updates on Operation Fallen Angel. Remind me to tell you later.,andy
19423,Hey.,jim
19424,"No talk, I'm animating.",pam
19425,"Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here. [pulls up Dwight's game] Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality.",jim
19426,Are you serious?,pam
19427,Yeah.,jim
19428,"Oh my God, he's really in pain.",pam
19429,[sighs],jim
19430,Who's that?,pam
19431,"Oh, it's just my avatar guy. Whatever.",jim
19432,He looks a lot like you. How much time did you spend on that?,pam
19433,"Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so---",jim
19434,Right... you're a sports writer in Philadelphia? Nice build too.,pam
19435,Yep.,jim
19436,You have a guitar slung on your back. I did not know you played guitar.,pam
19437,I... why don't we go back to this animation.,jim
19438,"No no no, I want to see more of Philly Jim. I want Philly Jim.",pam
19439,"Ah, show me how this works.",jim
19440,Oh boy.,pam
19445,Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.,michael
19448,"No, I hate it! I hate it! ...I don't hate it, I just don't like it at all. And it's terrible.",michael
19450,"Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl.",michael
19452,"No. I said I hate the, the style.",michael
19453,[singing] Break me off a piece of that lumber tar. Snickers bar.,andy
19454,"Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible.",michael
19455,Break me off a piece of that Grey Poupon.,andy
19456,"Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?",michael
19458,That'a girl.,michael
19460,"Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton?",michael
19462,"Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please? [Kevin hands her piece of tape]",michael
19463,"I hope you're not killing yourself on this, because I'm sure it's good enough for Michael's ad that will probably be seen by no one.",jim
19464,"Maybe, but it's not good enough for me yet.",pam
19465,Okay. Do you want me to stay?,jim
19466,"No no, you can go home. I'm good.",pam
19467,"Pam is staying late tonight to uh, achieve her dreams. So I'm pretty proud of her, unfortunately she was my ride home.",jim
19469,"I, ah...",jim
19471,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.",pam
19472,"Good morning. [Pam sees breakfast sitting on her desk] Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.",jim
19473,Thank you.,pam
19474,You're welcome.,jim
19475,"I worked until about 2:45 AM. And then I had to decide if I wanted to spend the night with Michael editing in his office, and Dwight watching Michael edit in his office, or drive home and probably fall asleep at the wheel and die in a fiery car wreck. I passed out on my keyboard trying to decide.",pam
19476,Let me pour you some bubbly because somebody got to a whole new level last night.,andy
19477,"Andy, I can't hear this right now.",dwight
19478,"No, no no no, this is good. You know how we haven't really gotten anywhere that I want to get to physically yet? Well, last night, that changed. We're makin' out, I'm kissin' her neck, and cheek and her ear lobe, and she's not really kissing me back. But she closes her eyes and she's like, 'Oh D, oh D.'",andy
19479,She called you D?,dwight
19480,Yeah. D for Andy.,andy
19481,Oh D.,dwight
19482,Oh D.,andy
19483,[whispers] Oh D.,dwight
19484,Oh D!,andy
19486,I'm about to send the ad to corporate... and it is sent. They'll probably watch it right away. I know I would. Okay. [dials phone],michael
19487,[on phone] Yes?,pam
19488,"Pam, please clear my phone lines.",michael
19489,"Certainly. [makes beeping noises] Okay, clear.",pam
19490,They could call at any second now. [sighs] Oh God...I better call.,michael
19491,"[Ten days later] Well, it's been tough. The uh, geniuses at corporate rejected my commercial and tonight they are airing the brain dead version. So welcome one and all to the world premiere of Corporate Crapfest!",michael
19494,"No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.",michael
19495,"Hey, could you do me a favor? Could you put that in the DVD player?",jim
19496,"Hey everybody! Just want to welcome you all to the premiere of the real Dunder Mifflin commercial, the Michael Scott director's cut. Hope you like it.",jim
19499,Animation? All her by the way. [points at Pam],jim
19501,I just thought you should---,jim
19503,Thanks.,pam
19505,Ahh. [puts his arm around Pam],jim
19507,"That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people!",michael
19508,"[singing] Claude Van Damme, Hair for Men, poison gas, NutraSweet. [speaking] It's gotta rhyme with 'piece.' Fancy Feast! [sings] Break me off a piece of that Fancy Feast! It's the cat food. Nailed it.",andy
19509,"All right! So, anybody else? No bad ideas. Everybody, let's keep 'em coming... oh, God.  Okay, Toby?",michael
19511,"There are no bad ideas but for an idea, that was really, really bad.",michael
19513,"And that is probably why most ads suck. [points to the ad men waiting outside the conference room] Oh, that's them!  Those are the ad guys right there. All right, my very fortunate and creative group, go back to your desks and I will let you know when it is time to film. [everyone starts leaving the conference room] [loud whisper] Pam! Pam, come here for a second. Did you get the memo about dressing your best?",michael
19514,Yeah.,pam
19515,About dressing your best today?,michael
19516,"Yeah, I distribute so I get all the memos.",pam
19517,"Cool. Cool, I just wanted to make sure you got it.",michael
19518,"Yeah, I get all the memos. [starts to leave]",pam
19519,"Okay, good. Good.",michael
19520,"This is Pam Beesly, representing our girl next door.  Pretty but nothing special.  You know, but she sort of keeps it real. What you might want to do, is if you could zoom in, like really quick zooms on her. Might be good.  [walking away]  Who else? [pointing] Oh, Creed... is the old guy over there. Don't look at him. You might want to use him to sort of get that Orville Redenbacher dynamic going.",michael
19523,"And if not we can just make him disappear. [walks quickly over to Jim's desk] This is Jim! Halpert. Jim has a very expressive face, don't you Jim? He is like our Mr. Bean.",michael
19524,Okay.,jim
19525,"So do, um, do sad, do the sad face.",michael
19526,I don't want -,jim
19527,"No, that's skeptical. Do sad.",michael
19528,Mmm...,jim
19529,"That's, that's a pirate movie. [Jim stares at Michael] That's annoyed. Well, he doesn't do very well under pressure.",michael
19531,"And anybody else, we can just hire an actor to replace.  Follow me!  Let's get this movin'. [Dwight goes back to his seat, embarrassed]",michael
19532,"All right, let's start.",michael
19533,"All right!  [sitting down behind Michael's desk] I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing, but...",jim
19534,"You are my producer, you are a suit.  I am the creative genius.  You take care of all the boring stuff, and let my mind just run free.",michael
19535,Yup.,jim
19536,"Now, we have eighty-five dollars, and a Sam Goody gift certificate...",michael
19537,Right.,jim
19538,...and we need to be done by 9 A.M. tomorrow.,michael
19539,Mmmhmm.  Why don't you start by telling me what you got.,jim
19540,We start on a single blank sheet of paper.,michael
19541,Love it.,jim
19542,And we widen to reveal ancient Rome.,michael
19543,"Mm, can't do that.",jim
19544,"Okay, we widen to reveal a spaceship blasting out of a woman's womb.",michael
19545,Definitely can't do that.,jim
19546,Bull[censored] man!,michael
19547,You know what?,jim
19548,This is bull[censored]!,michael
19549,"Okay, Scott, why don't you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial.",jim
19550,Ahhhh!  [sweeps toys off his desk],michael
19551,"I'm just doing my job, man.",jim
19552,"If you don't let me pursue my artistic vision, I am going to walk!",michael
19553,Good!  Fine!  I've got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee... [dialing phone],jim
19554,"No!  No!  Jim, Jim, don't, don't...",michael
19555,What?  What?,jim
19556,"No, I can do it.",michael
19557,What?,jim
19558,"I can do it good.  I can do it good.  Please, don't.  Please.  [kneels in front of desk] Please give me it.",michael
19559,"Okay, make a commercial.",jim
19560,[taps on desk and starts to leave his office] Do you want this open or closed?,michael
19561,"Closed. [Michael leaves his office, gives Jim two thumbs up, which Jim returns]",jim
19562,"Hey, everybody, I just got off the phone with David Wallace, and he has given us the go-ahead to make the first ever Dunder Mifflin television commercial.  Huh?",michael
19564,I can't hear you! [less applause]  Heard you a little bit less that time.  Must be...,michael
19565,We had already applauded.,dwight
19566,"Okay, okay.  Who could do music?",michael
19567,How about Darryl?,pam
19568,"Actually, I'm a little concerned about having a black person do the music, because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a... celestine prophesy, and keep the next Bon Jovi from ever picking up a piano.",michael
19569,"Michael is on a mission to prove that he's creative.  Which I think is odd, because Michael actually might be the most creative person I've ever known.  Every day, Michael says and thinks things that no one has ever said or thought before.",jim
19577,This is perfect.,michael
19578,He looks like your twin.,dwight
19579,"This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door.  When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring.  Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone.",michael
19580,I will know.,dwight
19581,"But, you will not tell anyone.",michael
19582,I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky.  Yeah.,dwight
19583,"Well, sometimes.  Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl.  [knock on the door]  Yes?  Oh good, good Stanley!  First victim, this is what I want you to do.  Go out, come back in.  We're going to hide.  I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?",michael
19585,"Just go out, and come back in.",michael
19587,What?,michael
19588,"Hey everyone, can I have your attention please?  I just thought you all should know that Stanley Hudson is planning on leaving us, because our old friend Karen from Utica is going to give him more money to work there.",michael
19590,"No, no, no, no, no-no, no no.  You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing.  Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her.",michael
19591,"Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.",jim
19592,"Okay, smarty pants, then why?  Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?",michael
19594,That could not possibly be it.,michael
19595,"You cannot take the hilarious black guy from the office.  Stanley is part of what makes this branch so extraordinary.  The bluesy wisdom, the sassy remarks, the crossword puzzles, the smile, those big watery red eyes.  I don't know how George Bush did it when Colin Powell left, and if Utica thinks that they are going to poach Stanley, they have another thing coming.",michael
19596,How can I get you to stay?,michael
19598,"Yeah we all want money.  But there is none in the budget, so... Tell me why you're really leaving.",michael
19600,"Mo money mo problems, Stanley.  You of all people should know that.  Let me ask you this, if I were-",michael
19602,"Pssh, kay.",michael
19603,"Oscar, did you bring it?",pam
19605,"Okay, well I have the tablecloth, don't forget the flatware.",pam
19607,"Oscar, Toby, and I are founding members of the Finer Things Club.  We meet once a month to discuss books and art, celebrate culture in a very civilized way.  Sometimes the debate can get heated, but we're always respectful.  There is no paper, no plastic, and no work talk allowed.  It's very exclusive.",pam
19609,So tell me again why I can't be part of your club?,jim
19610,Because some people think you monopolize the conversation by trying to be funny.,pam
19611,Oscar?,jim
19612,Some people.,pam
19614,"Fillipellers, how's it hanging?",michael
19616,To the left?,michael
19618,To the right?,michael
19620,"Okay, enough small talk, go ahead.",michael
19622,"Yes, listen, um...  You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this.",michael
19624,"No, his work family.  Look, this is very hard for me, but I'm going to give you my best man.  You may have Toby.",michael
19626,"You can train him.  He's very very smart, and funny, and charming... You know, I can't do it, Toby is the worst.  That- that was a bluff, um...  Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I'm going to poach one of yours.",michael
19628,"Okay, good-bye.  Wait!  Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?  Your best one?  [Karen hangs up]",michael
19629,"I have Ben Nugent on the line, he is the top salesman in Utica.",pam
19630,"Hi Ben, Michael Scott.",michael
19632,"I'm going to cut right to the chase here.  Do you like magic?  Because I'm a genie in a bottle, and I'm going to grant you three wishes.  To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend.",michael
19634,[giggles],pam
19635,"[to Pam] Get out. [to Ben] Uh, yeah.  I also saved her life, but I guess that's not as grabby.",michael
19637,"No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say?",michael
19639,"What is that guy talking about?  Scranton is not lame.  Scranton is the cool, fun branch.  We're like Animal House.",michael
19640,Found him!,dwight
19641,"Jim, we're getting crapped on.  Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it.",michael
19642,So what are you going to do?,jim
19643,"What are we going to do?  We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do.  Corcroan dropped Staples.",michael
19644,Did they?,jim
19645,"Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it.  You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale.  We're going to prove, what the hell is that music?",michael
19646,"It's Vivaldi, for Finer Things.",pam
19647,"That's the problem, that's the problem.  We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll.  Alright? [sees Toby in a bow-tie holding a plate full of tea cups] Oh... My... God, that's why people are leaving.  I- I have no words.",michael
19648,We just passed the exit for Corcroan.,jim
19649,What? What? We did?,michael
19651,Look at his face! Look at his face!,michael
19652,What are we doing?,jim
19653,"Egg dripping, blah, blah, blah.",dwight
19654,"What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?",michael
19655,"Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today.",dwight
19656,"We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we're doing.",michael
19657,We're going to Utica?,jim
19658,Uh-huh.,michael
19659,I'm not going to Utica right now.,jim
19660,"Yes you are.  Oh, buckle up Jim.",michael
19661,No.,jim
19662,We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.,michael
19665,In your face,michael
19666,Yow!,dwight
19667,I can't believe you guys.  I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.,jim
19668,Are you calling Karen?,michael
19669,"No, I'm not calling Karen.",jim
19670,He's lying.,dwight
19671,"Yep, get it.",michael
19672,"What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!",jim
19673,[throws Jim's cell phone out of the window] Gah-ah-hah-ha!,dwight
19674,Are you kidding me?,jim
19675,No communication with the outside world Jim.,dwight
19676,"It had to be done, it had to be done.",michael
19677,"Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so...",jim
19678,"Oh no, that is too bad.  Shoot.",dwight
19679,Okay.,jim
19680,"Hey Dwight, he found it.",michael
19681,You know what?  I'm just going to call a cab from here.,jim
19682,"Alright, you're going to miss the best prank ever.",michael
19683,"Alright.  Wait, what are you planning on doing?",jim
19684,Do you really wanna know?,michael
19685,"Oh, God. [hangs up phone]",jim
19686,"Follow me, come here.  Here's what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse.  I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.",michael
19687,Or real bombs.,dwight
19688,"No, no, not real bombs.",michael
19689,"Yeah, come on, it will be so badass.",dwight
19690,"Uh, maybe, maybe, I don't know.",michael
19691,No.,jim
19692,"It could be badass.  Yeah, it will.",michael
19693,"No, no absolutely we are not doing this.",jim
19694,"Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass.",dwight
19695,Are you kidding me?  We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?,jim
19696,Teach her to offer Stanley more money.,michael
19697,"So the deal was, Dwight doesn't blow anything up, and I wear a costume.  And a moustache.",jim
19698,"So, why did you and Karen break up?  Was it the sex?",michael
19699,What?,jim

19702,...awesome.,michael
19703,Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?,jim
19704,"Okay, I will start.  Um, 'A.' [singing] 'A' my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell...  Damn it! What do we sell?  Um...",michael
19705,It doesn't matter.,jim
19706,I'm trying to think of what we could sell.,michael
19707,Doesn't matter.,jim

19709,"That doesn't make sense, couldn't be.",jim
19710,"What is that?  Dwight, are you peeing?",michael
19711,I'm peeing in this empty can.,dwight
19712,Oh my God!,jim

19738,Guy's going by. Shh.,jim
19739,You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers.  And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.,michael
19740,"And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk.",dwight
19741,"No, no, you won't do that. Nope.",jim

19799,Hey Karen.,jim
19801,"First of all, hi.",jim

19804,Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier.,dwight
19805,Copy that.,jim
19808,"Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.",dwight
19810,Then we will burn Utica to the ground.,dwight
19811,"[whispers] Dwight.  Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them.  And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley's head, we will burn Utica to the ground. [they get up to leave]",michael
19813,Yes?,jim
19815,"Yeah, trying to quit though.",jim
19817,"Oh no, I didn't want to see you.  Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier.  Equal, I'd say it was equal.  So, good to see you...",jim
19819,"I mean, it's just that- [clears throat] You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you...",jim

19823,I... will... [gives up and walks away],jim
19824,"We tried and we failed.  Stanley, you may go.  Here is a box, for your things, but I doubt that that box will be able to contain all the memories that you have of this place.  Fly away sweet little bird, fly away and be free.  Pam, I'm gonna need some help writing a want ad.",michael

19829,Really?,michael
19831,Hey.,jim

19897,Morning.,michael
19899,Ryan invited some of the branch managers and Toby into the woods for a 'get to know you' weekend. Michael wasn't invited. Apparently they already knew everything they needed to know about him.,pam

19924,How so?,jim
19925,"A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores? [makes a noise and gestures with his hands]",michael
19926,What's that?,jim
19927,"Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. You know, here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself---",michael
19928,Right.,jim
19929,"In the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.",michael
19930,Not gonna change.,jim
19931,"I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos.",michael
19932,I thought we had that looked at.,jim
19933,I'm sick of it Jim. I'm sick of this place.,michael
19934,"When Jan and I had satellite, we used to watch a reality show called 'Survivorman.' And, it was interesting because it was about a guy who would go out in the middle of no where and just try not to die, try not to get eaten by an animal, or be overexposed.",michael
19935,"OK, I will only need two things. Roll of duct tape and a knife.",michael
19936,[winks] I'm on it. [leaves room],dwight
19937,"OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts. [Dwight comes back with set of knives] Hey, what...",michael

19939,"Hey, hey hey! Dwight. [Dwight rolls out an assortment knives]. Dwight.",michael
19940,"I keep various weaponries strategically placed around the office. I saved Jim's life with a can of pepper spray I had velcroed under my desk.

19943,No.,michael
19944,Great.,pam
19945,Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.,michael
19946,Oh.,pam
19947,Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours.,michael
19948,"Hmm, no, the choice is actually yours. Are you sure you want to do this?",jim
19949,"Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me.",michael
19950,"OK, great.",jim
19951,"This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I.",michael
19952,Yup.,jim

19954,That'd be great.,jim
19955,"Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills to survive in a hostile environment? Let's put it this way: no, I do not.",dwight
19956,"This is what a true survivor man does. You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck. You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets. Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer. Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead.",michael
19957,"No, I would never leave you for dead. You would never escape.",dwight
19958,"Well, yes I would. And I would survive.",michael
19959,I would make sure that you were dead.,dwight
19960,Well...,michael
19961,"First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified.",dwight
19962,You...,michael
19963,And they would call me the Overkill Killer.,dwight
19964,You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real. [blindfolds eyes with tie] OK.,michael
19965,What are you doing?,dwight
19966,"I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been--- [Dwight whacks Michael with his shoe] Ow! What are you doing?",michael
19967,It would be better if you were unconscious.,dwight
19968,"No! Gosh! Dwight. [Dwight tries to hit Michael with his shoe again] Stop it, stop it! Stop it.",michael
19969,Do you want to do this right or not?,dwight
19970,"Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?",michael
19972,"Oh, wasn't it just someone's birthday?",jim
19974,"I do remember, yeah.",jim
19976,"You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?",jim
19978,"There are thirteen people working in this office, so thirteen times a year Michael gets a cake and balloons, and some sort of joke gift and makes a toast. There are two types of toasts. One is a joke about how old you are.",jim
19979,[flashback to Stanley's birthday] Look at those wrinkles. Blacks do crack! Not crack the drug.,michael
19980,"And the other is something inappropriate. Or horrible. Or both. What else? He only sings the high harmony to 'Happy Birthday.' And he's a very big believer in surprise parties. Maybe even, arguably, possibly to a fault.",jim
19981,"[flashback to Kelly's birthday, hiding in the elevator] Happy Birthday!",michael
19983,"[flashback to Oscar's birthday, hiding in the break room] Happy Birthday!",michael
19985,"[flashback to Phyllis' birthday, sneaking up on Phyllis' car] Happy Birthday!",michael
19987,"So... I think, yeah, I think getting these out of the way might be productive.",jim
19988,"We can just have one big fun party. Everybody's happy, nobody wastes their time.",jim
19990,"Wow! You're shaking things up a bit, huh?",pam
19991,"It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?",jim
19992,Do you think it's a good idea?,pam
19993,No... I think it's a great idea.,jim
19994,[smiles] Hmm.,pam
19995,We're here. [gets out of the car],dwight
19996,Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.,michael
19997,[leading Michael from car] Here we go. Just the two of us [gestures for camera crew to follow],dwight
19998,"Here we go, into the wild. Mighty forest. Can you smell the trees and the nature?",dwight
19999,"Keep going, you're fine. Just some bushes and some thickets [leads Michael into some tall grass] Keep going. You wanted wilderness, you got it.",dwight
20000,"You know, try sending them another invoice.",jim
20002,"Alright. [starts walking away, but returns] Oh, did you see my memo by the way?",jim
20004,Right? I was just thinking...,jim
20006,Right! Exactly. [pats Oscar on the back and walks away] Knew I could count on you. [Oscar rolls his eyes],jim
20007,Good a spot as any. [They stop and Dwight starts spinning Michael around in circles],dwight
20008,"What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just --",michael
20009,I'm just --,dwight
20010,Stop.,michael
20011,Spin. I'm trying to confuse your sense of direction. [stops spinning and takes Michael's blindfold off] Behold.,dwight
20012,"Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight.",michael
20013,Here's your knife. Here's your duct tape.,dwight
20014,"Alright, very good. Ahh, OK. [Dwight gives Michael a hug]",michael
20015,"Good luck, Michael.",dwight
20016,"Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight. [Dwight runs off]",michael
20018,What's that?,jim
20020,"Oh, sure.",jim
20022,OK. [Meredith leaves],jim
20023,Wow! That was easy.,pam
20024,"Yeah, people like me I guess.",jim

20029,Everybody's birthday.,jim
20031,What do you want?,jim
20033,You want a birthday pie?,jim

20037,It will be Angela.,jim
20039,"[to own camcorder] Day One. I'm in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I've brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It's hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about [looks at watch] 2 o'clock in the afternoon. It's really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. [cuts pants with knife] OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don't hit my corroded artery here...",michael
20040,"I lied to Michael. I said that I would leave him alone, but I will not. I will remain close by to provide unseen moral support, but I will never help him. I will let harm befall him. I will even let him die. But I will never let him lose his dignity.",dwight
20041,"There we go. [standing with short sleeves and short pants] Much better. Now everything I brought with me can be used. My sport coat here, can be fashioned into a backpack of sorts [ties jacket around neck].",michael
20042,I'm going to wear what was once one of my pant legs. [puts pant leg on head like a hat],michael
20043,"See, this is a beautiful piece of material [rips other pant leg in half] This could be used for all sorts of things.",michael
20044,Some sort of kerchief to keep my neck nice and comfortable.,michael

20059,Michael is a man of great depth and passion. I don't know what he's searching for out here. [pulls a nest from a tree] I hope he finds it. [picks up some bird eggs] Lunch.,dwight
20060,"Well it is a little chillier than I had thought, so I have fashioned my hat back into my pants. Several hours in, time for me to find some nourishment. Now, these woods are full of creatures that can sustain human life. Things like, uh, squirrels, nice juicy rabbit would be delicious.",michael

20062,"I have made this spear, with which I will impale my dinner. And it couldn't come a moment too soon because I have been without food for a good three hours or so. I'm startin' to feel it a little bit. Ohh... It's Creed's birthday. [singing] Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to Creed. Happy Birthday to you. Happy birthday, buddy.",michael
20072,"Hey guys, what're we talking about?",jim
20074,"Well if you take a look at this, I tented my pants. I've made myself a nice pants tent shelter. And this little guy [pats a large tree trunk] may be Dunder Mifflin paper some day.",michael
20075,Nothing to worry about. Just using the scope. Safety is... [clicks rifle into safety mode] on.,dwight
20077,Toby.,jim
20079,"Oh, thanks man.",jim
20081,Is there anything --,jim
20083,"Oh, OK.",jim
20085,What?,jim
20087,I remember that.,jim
20089,Seriously?,jim
20091,"Toby's great. He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much. [in Toby voice] I don't see the harm in that. Well, it's a cake Toby, so, c'mon.",jim
20092,"OK. Yeah, you know what, we're just gonna throw you in. Because more the merrier, right?",jim
20095,"That's a bummer. OK, then we need to...[steps outside office] Hey everybody. Hi, how you doing? Can I have your attention please?  'Cause we have to talk about this birthday thing.",jim
20096,[raises hand] Conference room?,pam
20097,"Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing? [everyone raises hands] One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it.",jim
20102,"Yup, Phyllis called me Michael. And I will always and forever be haunted by that fact.",jim
20103,"Under this tree, I think I struck the mother load. Those [points camera to mushrooms] are nature's best mushrooms. Wild, and I have to say these little buggers are damn tasty as well. [puts them in mouth]",michael
20104,"Stop! No, no Michael! Nooo! Nooo! [runs up to Michael and knocks him over] Nooo! Arghh. Get, get them out. [picks out mushrooms from Michael's mouth]",dwight
20106,"Yeah! [everybody clapping] Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want -- OK, alright. Yeah, don't do that. You're gonna break something.",michael
20107,"Man became civilized for a reason. He decided that he liked to have warmth, and clothing, and television, and hamburgers, and to walk upright, and to have a soft futon at the end of the day. He didn't want to have to struggle to survive. I don't need the woods. I have a nice wood desk. I don't need fresh  air, because I have the freshest air around, A.C. And I don't need wide open spaces. Check it out. [shows off computer screen scenery] I can also make it the sky.",michael
20108,"Hey, buddy.",michael
20109,Hey.,jim
20110,What up?,michael
20111,Sure glad you're back.,jim
20112,You are relieved.,michael
20113,You have no idea.,jim
20114,So what did I miss?,michael
20115,"Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.",jim
20116,Oh.,michael
20117,"So, terrible idea.",jim
20118,"Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake.",michael
20119,You did do it?,jim
20120,"Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out.",michael
20121,"Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.",jim
20122,That's what I said. That's what she said.,michael
20123,That's what who said?,jim
20124,"I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard.",michael
20125,That's what she said.,jim
20126,"Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward.",michael
20127,Come in!,michael
20128,"Oh, it's Creed's birthday today.  Should we get him an ice-cream cake?  Mint chocolate chip?",pam
20129,"Pam, are you my friend?",michael
20130,"Oh, no.",pam
20131,"We have been friends forever, right?",michael
20132,"Yes, I have been working with you forever.",pam
20133,"Hypothetically... would you go camping with me, if I were to ask you?  And bear in mind that I would never actually ask you to go camping.  That Jim is also a friend of mine, and I would rather die than make any sort of improper ovation toward you.",michael
20134,I don't think so.,pam
20135,"Here's the thing.  When Michael invents a hypothetical situation, he eventually turns it into an actual situation.",pam
20136,"Do you understand that Jim is like a brother to me, and I would never do anything inappropriate?",michael
20137,I do.,pam
20138,"So, as friends, would you go with me on a camping trip?",michael
20139,No.,pam
20140,Thank you for your honesty.,michael
20141,You're welcome.  Open or closed?,pam
20142,"Split the difference.  Hey... mint chocolate chip, please?  Is Jim out there?",michael
20143,No.,pam
20144,Can you send Dwight in here?,michael
20145,"Yeah.  Dwight, Michael wants to see you in his office. [Dwight runs in]",pam
20146,You wanted to see me?,dwight
20147,"Mmhmm.  I had something very personal I would like to discuss. [Dwight closes door, takes off glasses, kneels in front of Michael's desk]  Would you go find Jim, and send him in here, please?",michael
20148,I'm on it.,dwight
20149,Michael has employed Dwight to track you down.,pam
20150,How much time do I have?,jim
20151,"Jim, Michael's office.",dwight
20152,"Couple minutes, give or take.",pam
20153,"Now, Jim!",dwight
20154,"And this... is a Hassenfass.  Case-hardened steel.  One side, as sharp as you'd ever want something to be.  The other side serrated for maximum damage.",dwight
20155,Okay.,michael
20156,Look at that.  Perfectly balanced.  This is a fine precision instrument.,dwight
20157,"All right, Dexter, just give me the knife.",michael
20158,Don't you want a sheath for that?,dwight
20159,"No, just get me a case. [Dwight looks at the camera, lifts his leg onto the desk, removes the sheath from his ankle, and gives it to Michael]  All right.",michael
20160,Anything else?  Flint...,dwight
20161,MmMmm.  All I need...,michael
20162,Parka...,dwight
20163,"No, Dwight!",michael
20164,"Tent, rainfly, gorp...",dwight
20165,"I'm telling you, all I will need are my instincts and my will to survive.",michael
20166,Mmmnnnnmmm...,dwight
20167,[holding up knife] What is this called again?,michael
20169,I'll call back.,michael
20171,"Every time Michael's in a meeting, he makes me come in and give him a Post-It note telling him who's on the phone. I did it once, and he freaked out. He loved it so much. The thing is he doesn't get that many calls. So he has me make them up every 10 minutes.",pam
20172,"[Pam walks in and shows Michael a note that says 'Good Morning'] Yeah, um, tell him I'll call him back.",michael
20174,You can't always work 200 days though.,michael
20175,"[Pam walks in and shows Michael a note that has a smiley face] Oh, no, no, no, I don't have time for this. Tell him I'm in a meeting. [Jan looks impressed]",michael
20177,Yep.,michael
20179,"Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later.",michael
20181,"N-No, money isn't everything Ryan. And you're my friend, and I don't want to be rude.",michael
20183,"I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist.",michael
20185,"Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through? [Pam pushes a button the phone] Hi buddy.",michael
20187,"Yeah, I hate that.",michael
20189,"So, here's the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs.",michael
20191,"Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? I'm feeling a little queasy.",michael
20193,Well-,michael
20195,Disray .My friend Disray got news specs. Disray spect. My friend Inappro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor.,michael
20197,Yep. Tell them how much you're gonna get if you win.,michael
20199,Million dollars!,michael
20201,"Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like it's not memorized.",michael
20203,Perfect crime.,michael
20205,"Could we please pull over and pull down the top, I do not feel good.",michael
20207,"I'm getting car sick! Ugh, I'm gonna puke. I think I'm gonna throw up.",michael
20209,"Hey, Schneider, real quick. What do you call a butt load of lawyers driving off a cliff?",michael
20211,"Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus. [To Jan] Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is.",michael
20213,Hey hey.,michael
20216,I would love that.,michael
20218,Abso-fruitley. Yeah. I'll-I'll do anything for the company.,michael
20220,It is.,michael
20222,"All right, let's run it back.",jim
20223,The warehouse got a ping pong table last week. Now Jim comes down and plays with Darryl. Sometimes I bring him juice. My boyfriend is 12.,pam
20225,"Hi, Kelly.",pam
20227,I don't wanna guess.,pam
20230,Jim. Can I see you for a second?,pam
20231,Sure.,jim
20232,Wow.,jim
20233,"Okay, it's not regulation size, but it'll do. You have to practice. You have to get real good and beat Darryl.",pam
20234,"Oh, I can't beat Darryl.",jim
20235,Please? Kelly's trash talking me because Darryl is beating you.,pam
20236,"What, seriously? What is she saying?",jim
20240,So you're asking me to defend your honor against Kelly?,jim
20241,"Sorta, yes.",pam
20242,Bring me players.,jim
20243,Okay.,pam
20245,"Hi. [Michael sees Toby] No, no, absolutely not. What is he doing here?",michael
20247,"Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition?",michael
20249,Never. I want him gone. I don't talk until he leaves.,michael
20252,Okay. All right.,michael
20254,Yessh.,michael
20256,"Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.",michael
20259,"Hey, Kevin. Jim needs to see you.",pam
20261,He needs help balancing some travel receipts.,pam
20263,"Yeah, no, he asked for you specifically. He's in the conference room.",pam
20266,"I haven't actually seen it. But I have seen the firm, and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief",michael
20268,Six years and two months.,michael
20270,That's what she said.,michael
20272,That's what she said.,michael
20274,"Uh, wh-why would she say that?",michael
20278,Come again? That's what she said? I don't know what you're talking about.,michael
20284,"Well, delivery is all wrong. She's butchering it.",michael
20287,She thought it had to do with the twins. That's what I call them.,michael
20289,"Um, to be delicate, they hang off milady's chest. They... make milk.",michael
20291,Yes.,michael
20293,"Yes, and frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant.",michael
20295,"Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules.",michael
20297,"Because before we started dating, we disclosed our relationship to HR. And I have the proof right here. [makes a gasping sound]",michael
20299,I will allow it.,michael
20301,Uh...,michael
20303,Uh-huh.,michael
20305,"Ugh. Well, de-depends on how you define 'begin'. I mean, if it was from the first time we shook hands, that's like six years ago. If it's from the first time we kissed, that's like two years ago.",michael
20307,"If it was the first time we kissed sober, it was like four months after that.",michael
20310,Line.,michael
20314,Good game Meredith.,jim
20316,All right! What is going on here?,dwight
20317,"Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?",jim
20318,"[Dwight and Jim are playing ping-pong, and Dwight scores] What the hell?",jim
20319,I told you.,dwight
20320,"All of my heroes are table tennis players. Zoran Primorac, Jan-Ove Waldner, Wang Tao, J'rg Ro'kopf,  and of course Ashraf Helmi. I even have a life size poster of Hugo Hoyama on my wall. And the first time I left Pennsylvania was to go the hall of fame induction ceremony of Andrzej Grubba.",dwight
20321,"Jan and I had an off again, on again relationship for two years. And I know this destroys her case, and I am sorry, but I throw myself at the mercy of the deposition.",michael
20324,Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What are you doing with my diary?,michael
20326,Irie.,michael
20329,I don't think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary.,michael
20334,"[looking for a place to sit, goes to Toby's table] Can I sit here?",michael
20336,How can you give up my diary like that?,michael
20338,How'd you even find it?,michael
20340,I don't like lump. I'm really upset about this.,michael
20342,Fine. I love you.,michael
20345,"Not a woman, just a cool, great looking, best friend.",michael
20348,"Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had sex with Jan, and yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly didn't consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful.",michael
20350,Thank you very much. You didn't have to say that.,michael
20352,"That was before our relationship. She was going through a divorce, and she was drinking a lot... [Jan glares at Michael] ...of water.",michael
20354,March 17th.,michael
20356,Yes.,michael
20358,"[reading the performance review] 'I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks. Mr. Scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee, and a poor branch manager. I recommend he be removed from that position and re-assigned to sales where he belongs.'",michael
20360,"[stares at Diane, eyes tearing up]",michael
20362,[walks in the conference room where Jim and Dwight are playing ping-pong] How's it going?,pam
20363,"Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable.",dwight
20364,"Check this out though, spin serve. [serves, and Dwight scores] Well, it works like 80% of the time, so...",jim
20365,"Nice. So, should I reschedule the rematch with Darryl now?",pam
20366,I think I'm ready.,jim
20367,I'll make the call.,pam
20368,"Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass.",dwight
20369,"...Right. Spin-serve! [serves, and Dwight scores]",jim
20370,How can you do that to me?,michael
20374,"Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it.",michael
20377,See? I was his number 1 contender. I was being groomed.,michael
20381,...Absolutely not.,michael
20382,[watches Jim score in ping-pong against Darryl] Yes! Way to go. [looks at Kelly] See that?,pam
20386,"You know what? I'm sick of this! Let's go, you and me!",pam

20399,"Oh, hey no biggie. Just...",michael
20401,"[nods and shakes hands with David Wallace] Hey, David?",michael
20403,I think you're a nice guy too.,michael
20405,"Why did I do it? I don't know. Jan said that it was because of the photo that she revealed the diary. But she already brought the diary with her to New York, so... You expect to get screwed by your company, but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend.",michael
20406,[Driving with Jan in the car] What do you want to do for dinner?,michael
20408,Sure trying to save some money... get something cheap.,michael
20410,Do you fast food?,michael

20414,"My friend's basement. All right, ready to start?",jim
20416,What are you doing?,jim
20419,"Right. There, first...",jim
20421,I think that's the question that you had...,jim
20422,What are you doing?,pam
20424,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. [makes 'talking' gesture with her hand]  Jim, come on, we gotta get in there and practice.  Okay?  I'm not kidding!",pam
20425,Wow. [heads toward the conference room],jim
20426,Now.  Get good work done.  Concentrate.,pam
20427,All right.,jim
20428,On your backhand. [Jim opens the conference room door and enters],pam
20434,What are you guys doing?,jim
20436,"Oh yeah, how long's this meeting going to last?  [Stanley mumbles, looking at his watch]",jim
20438,I played a lot of pong growing up.  I spent a lot of time on cruise ships.  I'm also a monster snorkler.,andy
20439,"Okay, you know what, this table's not regulation.",andy
20440,Good eye - it's an oval.  [Andy compares his arm length to his side of the conference table] You're measuring the table.,jim
20441,Do you know anything about physics?,andy
20442,Do you?,jim
20443,"Just serve.  Let's go. [hits one into net]  Dammit!  These balls are weighted weird, aren't they?",andy
20444,Yup.,jim
20445,"Yeah.  Get another one. [throws the offending ball at Jim, who takes another from his pocket]",andy
20446,"Now, wait a minute.  You're not gonna punch a wall, or me, or anything like that if you don't win the point, are you?",jim
20447,"I don't know! No, okay, just... serve!",andy
20448,"I have some, uh, experience.  I, um, once had to testify in a traffic accident case.",michael
20450,"Yes.  My testimony was actually very important, um, because the accident was my fault.  [To Toby] Tell Meredith I said it another time [Toby nods].",michael
20452,"Before we continue, I would like to make an opening statement.",michael
20454,"[clears throat and stands] Ladies and gentlemen of... the... table.  I would just like to say what a joy it is for me to be here today, but frankly, at my age, it's a joy to be anywhere [no one laughs].  I'm only forty-four, so I'm not old, and I guess that doesn't really play.  But the point is, I have a sense of humor.   And I implore you all to have a sense of humor as well.  Jan, David, my wonderful girlfriend [indicates Jan, then turns to David Wallace], my gorgeous company... Why don't we all just take a big deep breath... and just relax [breathes in deeply, no one responds].  Good.  That feels good [sits].  All right.  Everybody feel better?",michael

20472,"Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, I'm - God, I'm so mad! [on phone] This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we don't want to work. No we don't! It's not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! We're not going to do it! [hangs up] Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday.",michael
20473,Thank you Michael.,dwight
20474,"All right, happy Friday. [to Jim] Well I think we dodged a bullet there.",michael
20475,I think you did.,jim
20476,"I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?",michael
20477,"Oh, I-",jim
20478,You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said.,michael
20479,"Michael has asked Pam and me to dinner at least 9 times. And every time we've been able to get out of it. But I've got to give him credit, he got me. Because I'm starting to suspect that there was no assignment from corporate.",jim
20480,"Michael, what time should I be arriving?",dwight
20481,"Dwight, it's couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy.",michael

20537,It's actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this. [Lies down],michael
20539,"I finally broke down and bought myself a plasma TV. Check it out. [reveals a tiny TV] I actually hung this on the wall myself. I want to show you something . A lot of people in the room, need more space? [moves TV back a couple inches] Voila, right in the wall.",michael
20540,Wow.,jim
20541,"Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table.",michael

20574,How 'bout a toast. Shall I? Here's to good friends.,michael
20576,Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth.,michael
20577,What was that?,jim
20579,Yeah that sounds good.,michael
20582,"You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him.",michael
20585,"[To camera] I don't care what they say, I just want to eat. Which I realize is a lot to ask for... at a dinner party.",pam
20586,[playing charades] No it's a... hump. There's a hump.,andy
20588,"Okay yes, first name of that animal and the second name is the state where Helena is the capital.",andy
20589,Montana.,pam
20591,Joe Montana!,pam
20592,Yes! Yes.,andy
20593,Why didn't you just say 49ers quarterback?,pam
20594,"All right, [rhythim clapping] my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn.",michael
20596,"What, no, I'm just making people laugh.",michael
20598,"Yes, I was watching Jim's face.",michael
20600,And he was laughing.,michael
20602,"Look at him, he's laughing.",michael
20603,Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game and it's called 'Let's see how uncomfortable we can make our guests' and they're both winning. So I'm going to make a run for it. [holds cellphone],jim
20604,"You'll never guess, I just got a message from my landlord apparently, my apartment flooded, something with a sprinkler. Pam, we should probably get going and see the damage.",jim
20605,Oh okay.,pam
20606,Well you don't need two of you to do that.,michael
20607,"That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much.",jim
20608,"Oh Jim, I don't think you're going to abandon this party here all by itself.",pam
20609,I don't know because I everything I own is there.,jim
20610,You can buy new stuff but you can't buy a new party.,pam
20611,"That's true, that's a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right.",michael
20612,"Michael, you're up.",andy
20613,"All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom-",michael
20615,"All right, Okay, okay, you're getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE.",michael
20617,Katie Holmes.,jim
20618,"No, Baah! But he's married to her!",michael
20619,"Oh, Dawson's Creek.",jim
20620,"No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, I'm gonna pass, I'm gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger.",michael
20622,Not really a rhyme.,jim
20624,"Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator.",michael
20626,Tom Cruise!,jim
20627,No!,michael
20628,Time!,andy
20629,"God, does anybody read the paper?!",michael
20630,"[Michael offers his coat to Pam, who is shivering] Oh, thank you.",pam
20631,You're welcome.,michael
20633,I don't like that story babe.,michael
20635,"Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.",michael
20637,"Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! I'm in hell! Aaahhh I'm burning, help me!",michael
20639,Is there more wine in the kitchen?,pam
20644,"No, yeah. What?",pam
20646,"Oh, are you joking?",pam
20648,"I have never, ever dated, or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever. Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever.",pam
20651,[in the garage] So I spend most of my time right here. Have a hand [the chairs are shaped like hands]. So Jim I noticed you checking out Jan's candles.,michael
20652,Oh no she just put it in front of my face.,jim
20653,"Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of 'Serenity by Jan' What do you think about that?",michael
20654,"Thought about it, I'm in.",andy
20655,"I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company?",jim
20656,I'm sorry. [doorbell rings] What now?,michael
20658,Hello.,dwight
20660,"We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?",dwight
20661,[whispering] Awesome.,pam
20664,Dwight is my friend.,michael
20666,"You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person.",michael
20668,"Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?",michael
20670,"When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasn't so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didn't want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children.",michael
20672,Do you mean it? You want to have a kid? [Jan walks away],michael
20674,So can we come in?,dwight
20675,Hmmm... Mmm... great turkey leg.,dwight
20677,"Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?",dwight
20680,Hey hey hey hey. [to Angela] I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times.,dwight
20682,[leans across to Pam whispering] Pam... I hope she didn't do anything to the food.,michael
20683,[whispers] Like... like what?,pam
20684,"I can't prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me. [Jan serves the food] Hey, looks great babe.",michael
20685,Yeah it does.,andy
20686,I know Jan didn't poison the food. I know that. But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover?,pam
20688,"You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?",michael
20690,Excuse me for a second. [gets up from the table],michael
20691,[to babysitter] So... how do you guys know each other?,jim
20693,And now you guys are dating?,pam
20694,Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.,dwight
20695,Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...,jim
20697,Nevermind.,jim
20698,Ok... alright... here we go. [takes down huge painting behind his seat and puts up a neon beer sign] There. [plugs it in] Oooookay.,michael
20699,That's nice.,jim
20700,Everybody enjoying their meal?,michael
20702,Yeah?,michael
20704,No. No. I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.,michael
20706,[to the guests] Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good.,michael
20708,BFD. I'm a screenwriter.,michael
20710,NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS!,michael
20712,MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES!,michael
20714,OH GOOD. I'LL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER!,michael
20716,"[yells] THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! [Jan gets an evil look on her face and picks up Michael's dundie and throws it into his plasma screen tv] THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe! [Jan goes upstairs crying.]",michael
20718,Fine. Get outta here.,dwight
20719,It's getting late.,jim
20720,"You know what guys, she'll be out of the bathroom soon.",michael
20721,[Jim and Pam head out the door and there are policemen at the door] Of course,jim
20722,"Get out of my way, I'll take care of this. OK.[to police] Uhhh what seems to be the problem officers?",dwight
20724,Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.,michael
20726,Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.,michael
20728,Would she get into trouble?,michael
20730,I will take the fall. I did it.,michael
20734,[puts his hand on the Officer's shoulder] Michael can come home with me.,dwight
20735,Jim? Pam?,michael
20736,Oh... my apartment's on fire,jim
20737,[whispers] Flooded.,pam
20738,Flooded.,jim
20739,You people. [to Michael] Come on. You're sleeping with me.,dwight
20740,No.,michael
20741,I'm gonna take you home Michael.,dwight
20742,Nope.,michael
20743,Alright. [leads Michael away],dwight
20745,"[Pam and Jim are sitting in Jim's car in front of Detroit Coney Island Chili Dogs] This is the best burger I've ever had, babe.",pam
20746,"You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad.",jim
20747,Hmm?,pam
20748,[holds up Hunter's CD] I stole this. [Pam laughs] For you babe.,jim
20749,"[Hunter's voice starts singing, Pam joins in] One night...",pam
20750,"My ideals at a party? Easy. Jim. Pam. Ryan. The Mayor. Barack Obama. Shiloh Jolie-Pitt. Because at the end of the night, Brad or Angelina would have to come and pick him up and I would get to meet them. Shia La Beef because of Disturbia. Umm, all of the children of the world. Val Kilmer. But he probably wouldn't come, too famous. Obviously George Clooney. Umm... And Jan definitely, if there was room.",michael
20751,"I'll tell you about my ideal dinner party. John Wilkes Booth. Lee Harvey Oswald. Osama Bin Laden. John Wayne Gacy. Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer. 'Oh hey guys, welcome to my home. Oh, here comes the waiter with the soup, hope you guys are hungry.' Meanwhile, the waiter suddenly nods at me. [Dwight nods] But I don't acknowledge him. But I know he's an assassin because I trained him. Boom. Two minutes later, five dead psychopaths at my dining room table. All that's left to do is dispose of the bodies and collect the reward. Ugh, it's almost too easy.",dwight
20753,"[to Jim, quietly] Food!",pam
20755,I believe it means mouth pleaser.,andy
20757,"It's French.  I studied some French during my semester at sea.  Or, shall I say a semester at la mer, which is French for 'sea.'",andy
20759,"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.",andy
20762,"Yes, I did, for you, princess.  Even though I only went number one. [quietly to Jim] I didn't really wash my hands.  Ohhh, what have we here?  This looks delicious. [picks up amuse-bouche tray]",michael
20763,[quietly] Not with your hands.,pam
20764,[touching and moving each amuse-bouche] They need to be presented... royally... anyone?,michael
20765,Mmm. [takes one and eats it],andy
20766,Good stuff.  All right.   Let's get down to some wine drinking.,michael
20767,"Oh, my God, [eating a bar in the hallway] I thought I was gonna pass out.  [Jim takes it from her and takes a bite]",pam
20768,We should probably get back.,jim
20769,"Mmm-mm.  I'm probably just gonna stay here for a while, say I got lost.",pam
20771,It was just a little...,pam
20772,"I didn't have anything, Jan.",jim
20774,"I'm sorry.  She scares me. [walks away, Pam keeps eating]",jim
20775,"Michael's dinner party is for couples only, which is why I wasn't initially invited.  But that was then.  I very recently entered into a serious, monogamous relationship.  [looking around] If that idiot ever gets here.",dwight
20777,Where did you grow up?,pam
20778,It's been a rough couple of weeks.,michael
20780,"Little trouble.  Yes.  Well, Jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift.",michael
20781,"Wow, you did neighborhood watch?",pam
20782,Yes.,michael
20784,"So she's passed out, and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors' dog...",michael
20786,And the neighbors blamed Jan.,michael
20788,"It's like, you know, the dog shouldn't have been outside in the first place.  Anyway, it's a tragedy, really, because the paint is not gonna come off the dog until it sheds...",michael
20790,So...,michael
20792,Well.,michael
20794,What's that?,jim
20799,W.B. Jones is renovating their offices and their construction crews are taking up some of the parking spaces we used to get.,pam
20800,So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.,jim
20801,Which just means we get to see more of our lovely street. Tell them what we saw today Jim.,pam
20802,"Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.",jim
20803,Nature.,pam
20805,"I lost a penny out of my loafers, Oscar.",andy
20807,Some of us like the walk more than others.,pam
20809,[to Michael who is looking at a chair catalog] Did you pick a new chair? It's been awhile.,pam
20810,"Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair.",michael
20811,"But instead, you found something to distract you from ever picking out a chair.",pam
20812,"Michael started the process of selecting a new chair about three weeks ago. And normally I wouldn't care, but he promised me his old one. It's way better. It's one of these. [makes a shrrhhh sound of a chair moving downward as Pam slumps down] I really want it.",pam
20813,[holding up the catalog] Have you ever seen this woman?,michael
20814,Her?,pam
20815,Hmm...,michael
20816,The one in the really great mesh black high-back swivel chair?,pam
20817,"Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She's got - I don't know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.",michael
20818,Or in a great chair.,pam
20819,"Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women?",michael
20820,I definitely remember your dinner party.,pam
20821,I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman. [whispers] Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.,michael
20822,"Actually, I put the catalog in your hands 'cause you have to pick out a new chair.",pam
20823,What is it like being single? I like it. I like starting each day with a sense of possibility. And I'm optimistic because every day I get a little more desperate and desperate situations yield the quickest results.,michael
20824,"Ladies and gentleman, would you please open your supply catalogs and kindly turn to page 85. [phone rings]",michael
20826,"[on phone] No, he hasn't picked one yet.",pam
20829,"I am ready to start dating again. Getting back on the market. So, FYI, for those of you who are thinking about fixing me up with any of your friends, use the woman on page 85 as a template. That will be all.",michael
20830,I left my cell phone in my car.,andy
20832,"[to Kevin] Listen man, I am completely over Jan, so, would you set me up?",michael
20834,I thought that you were engaged?,michael
20836,"Whaaaat? God, that's terrible man. Eghh, she's crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends?",michael
20838,Oh...,michael
20840,Yeah... ugh. She's... [gets up and leaves] you don't deserve her. Alright.,michael
20841,"[sitting on Oscar's desk] Oh hello Oscar Mayer Weiner lover. I bet that you have a bunch of very liberal girl type friends that trust you implicitly because they know you'd never touch 'em, because of your condition. Umm...",michael
20843,What?,michael
20845,Oh.,michael
20847,"Hmm, I see, feisty. So she's not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?",michael
20849,Oooo. Catcher or in field?,michael
20851,"Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?",michael
20853,I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing? [silence] It bothers me that you're not answering the question.,michael
20855,"Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK!",michael
20856,What is wrong with these people? I would do anything for them and they're just hanging me out to dry.,michael
20857,"Dating shouldn't be hard for somebody like me, but it is and you know why? Because nobody here is willing to help me. Nothing would ever get done in this office without a formal request, would it? Well, fine. Here goes.",michael
20859,"Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear 'Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la.' No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired.",michael
20860,[gets up from chair] Write legibly people.,dwight
20861,"Because of the construction at W.B. Jones, half of us have to park in the satellite lot.",andy
20862,Hmm..,michael
20863,It's like a ten minute walk.,andy
20865,"Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so... Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one. [thinks] OK, yes that would be bad.",michael
20867,Yes.,andy
20868,That would be bad.,michael
20869,OK.,andy
20871,...So help us out.,andy
20872,"Wish I could, but I can't. Well can, but won't. Should, maybe, but shorn't.",michael
20874,"What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.",michael
20875,We won't let you down.,andy
20876,"Oh you can't because I don't care. Listen, [Kevin and Andy high five as they leave Michael's office] don't forget to fill out those cards. My love cards.",michael
20879,[to Jim] Who are you putting down?,pam
20880,"Oh, you don't know her.",jim
20881,Who is it?,pam
20882,Your mom.,jim
20883,"Yeah, whatever. [Jim holds up the card] [Pam laughs] Give it to me. Give it to me.",pam
20884,"Ok, Wendy. Hot and juicy red head. Give this a try. [Michael dials phone number. Phone rings.]",michael
20886,"Hello Wendy, this is Kevin's friend, Michael.",michael
20888,"Oh, I'm sorry, could you put her on please?",michael
20890,"[under breath] Damn it Kevin. OK, umm, could I just have a frosty and a baked potato please?",michael
20892,"Well, I'll send somebody to come pick it up. Just have it ready.",michael
20894,Well put it aside. [hangs up the phone] [Dwight enters] Umm... yeah.,michael
20895,"OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.",dwight
20896,Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model...,michael
20897,"I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit.",dwight
20898,"That sounds good. [both smile] Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go.",michael
20899,"[on phone] That is fantastic. Thank you, thank you very much. This is just what I needed.",dwight
20900,"The furniture company gave me the name of the advertising agency. They gave me the name of the photographer. The photographer, a Spaniard, used a Wilkes-Barre modeling agency. The agency gave me the following information. [reads from notepad] Deborah Shoshlefski. 142 South Windsor Lane. Dead. Car accident. Case closed.",dwight
20901,She's dead? [Dwight makes knife slitting noise] She's so young.,michael
20902,She was so young and now she is dead. As dead as every dead animal who has ever died.,dwight
20903,"Oh, God. Oh...",michael
20904,Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on. [gets up and leads Michael to sit in his chair] Here we go. Yeah.,dwight
20905,"Michael, you didn't even know her.",jim
20906,Try not to be so hurtful Jim.,michael
20907,"Jim, how dare you. [Jim's face is in shock]",dwight
20908,"Please, not at a time like this. [sighs]",michael
20909,"OK Michael, you know what? I might have someone for you.",pam
20910,Oh really? What's her name? Burger King?,michael
20911,"No, I mean it. [walks towards Michael] She's really nice and sweet and you guys might actually get along. [hands over card to Michael]",pam
20912,"I don't, I don't think I'm ready. Is she hot?",michael
20913,"I'm setting Michael up with my land lady. She's really sweet and... whatever, I just can't take Michael like this.",pam
20914,"No question about it, I am ready to get hurt again.",michael
20916,"[while brushing teeth with an electric toothbrush] No, not the five families.",michael
20919,"[still brushing teeth] Sorry, I don't have time for this right now. I'm trying to get a date with Pam's hot friend. And she needs to meet me right now.",michael
20921,"[to cashier at coffee shop] Thank you very much. Our suspect has straight brown hair. She is wearing blue jeans and a black top. So... behold our bachelorette [cut to a blonde woman in a skirt]. Give her ten for looks and a three for her ability to describe herself. Hello, my lady. [woman walks right by and doesn't respond]",michael
20923,[turns around to see the woman from his description] Ugh.,michael
20925,Is who a Michael what?,michael
20927,"Oh, that's not, yeah I'm not... OK...",michael
20929,So you get the rent checks every month and what happens next? What...,michael
20931,Just making conversation.,michael
20932,"Why is it so hard to meet people? I... you know... it's uh... All I want is somebody nice and sweet and someone I can talk to and share an experience with, you know? Why is it so hard for people like us?",michael
20934,You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind. [holds up cell phone with a picture of Jan] Look at that.,michael
20936,"Yeah. Yeah, and you can't see her whole body. Down here, she's got a boob job. Just... she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don't know.",michael
20939,"Oh, OK. Well, umm... I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus.",michael
20941,Now you ruined it. [gets up and leaves],michael
20943,Uh Michael Scott could not make it today due to an unforeseen prior engagement.,andy
20945,"Gentleman please. We called this meeting. Andrew Bernard is the name of me. And this is my associate, Mr. Kevin Malone.",andy
20948,"Well first of all, I'd just like to say [pulls out note cards] what an honor it is to be sitting here with you gentlemen.",andy
20958,"Margaret the land lady? Really Pam, is that what you think of me?",michael
20959,She's sweet and cute. I thought you'd get along.,pam
20960,"Oh, OK, Well I'm looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I'm a man... of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately. God...[walks away back to his office]",michael
20961,[walks up to reception] Margaret?,jim
20962,I know.,pam
20963,You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment. [both laugh],jim
20964,"Oh I don't care, I didn't really like that place that much anyway. I'll just move.",pam
20965,"Oh really? Who's gonna take you in? You're messy. You're a klutz, you spill everything. And you leave the volume on the TV way too loud.",jim
20966,"Yeah, maybe I'll just move in with my boyfriend 'cause he's kind of a slob, too.",pam
20967,"OK, sure. Let's do it. [Pam laughs]",jim
20968,"No, I umm, well I'm not gonna, I'm, I'm not gonna move in with anyone unless I'm engaged.",pam

20971,"Oh, well, that's coming. [smiles]",jim
20972,"Oh, right now?",pam
20973,"No. Not gonna do it right here, that would be rather lame.",jim
20974,"OK, so then, when?",pam
20975,"Pam, I'm not gonna tell you. Hate to break it to you, but that's not how that works.",jim
20976,"Oh, right, yeah.",pam
20977,"Wait, I'm serious. It's happening.",jim
20978,Ohh kay.,pam
20979,"And when it happens, it's going to kick your ass, Beesly. So... stay sharp.",jim
20980,I've been warned.,pam
20981,I am not kidding. [shows camera an engagement ring] Got it a week after we started dating.,jim
20982,I don't know man. I was with Jan for so long. I was excited about meeting somebody new. Put my heart out there. It's just... [sighs],michael
20983,You know what you need? Closure.,dwight
20984,You're right. What do you mean though?,michael
20985,"There was a woman in your life who affected you very deeply, and she left before you could say good bye. I think you need to say good bye.",dwight
20986,Hmm.,michael
20987,Come on. I'll drive.,dwight
20989,[at same time as Kevin] I did it.,andy
20992,Nice job.,pam
20993,Nice. [fist bumps Kevin],jim
20994,"Yeah, there it is. You're welcome.",andy
20995,"Did I do this for me? No, I did this for the little guy. For Joe Sixpack. The guy who wakes up every morning in his four hundred dollar a month apartment, wonders how's he gonna pay his mortgage that month. Wonders how he's gonna fill his car up with oil. Wonders how I'm gonna pay my kid's orphanage bills. That guy shouldn't have to wonder where he's gonna park.",andy
20996,[looking at the chair model's headstone] How did she die?,michael
20997,I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger.,dwight
20998,God.,michael
20999,Yeah.,dwight
21000,She was so innocent.,michael
21001,She was stoned apparently.,dwight
21002,"You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that's just silly because she's dead. What do you do?",michael
21003,You wait until next year's chair catalog comes out and you find someone who's still alive.,dwight
21004,"Oh, you move on.",michael
21005,Yeah.,dwight
21006,Where do you want to go for dinner?,jim
21007,"I don't know, I kind of hate all our regular places right now. Oh, you know what [Jim gets down on one knee], that one...",pam
21008,"Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe?",jim
21009,[smiling] I hate you. [walks away],pam
21010,"What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem? [Pam laughs] Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh.",jim
21011,"Oh, oh.",pam
21012,"No, no, no.",jim
21013,How could I have thought that? How could I have thought that?,pam
21014,"[singing] Bye, bye, Ms. Chair Model lady. I dreamt that we were married and you treated me nice. We had lots of kids...drinking whiskey and rye, oh why'd you have to go off and die? Why'd you have to go off [with Dwight] and die?",michael
21016,Return.,michael
21017,Rhythm and blues...,dwight
21018,This'll be [with Dwight] the day that I died.,michael
21019,"It is moving day.  I have spent the last month here at Dwight's lovely farm, taking a little bit of a vacation, clearing my head after Jan and I, um [Dwight puts his fingers to his head and makes a shooting noise] ssp... No, I did not kill her.  We were just at different places in our lives.  No, I thought I'd be the bigger man and allow her to stay at the condo.  She has since moved on; she is staying with her sister in Scottsdale.  Fresh outlook, and it's all good.",michael
21020,"Okay, so look that over, make sure it's accurate.",dwight
21021,Oh.  What is this?,michael
21022,"Your bill, minus the ten percent Dunder Mifflin corporate discount.",dwight
21023,You were charging me?  I'm your friend.,michael
21024,You occupied the America room for six weeks.  That's our most popular room.,dwight
21025,There was no other guest the entire time I was here.,michael
21026,Right.  Because you were in the America room.  In an election year.,dwight
21027,"Okay.  All right, Dwight.  Take my money.  Go ahead.  Keep in mind that this whole thing was just a business transaction.  The late nights, the talks, the slumber parties, the crying jags, that was all business, that had nothing to do with friendship, and being friends.  Just ring me up.  Go ahead [Dwight tears up bill].",michael
21028,"Thank you, Dwight.",michael
21029,"We don't take debit cards, anyway.",dwight
21030,"Dwight, little help with the bags, please.",michael
21031,"So, what about you, Angela?  Do you have any single friends?",michael
21033,"A cute little religious type, someone who wears a uniform, or...",michael
21035,"No, no, obviously older.",michael
21037,"Love.  Marriage.  Baby carriage.  Those have been my goals ever since I heard that song.  Jan and I had love.  We did not have marriage.  We did have a baby carriage, which I got her for bringing groceries home, after she got a DUI.",michael
21039,"[sitting at her desk] Hey, Kelly.",michael
21041,Nothing.  Just hangin'.  Chillin'.  No agenda.  Would you consider hookin' me up with one of your friends?,michael
21043,Yeah?,michael
21045,That's hilarious.  What's her number?,michael
21047,"Mmm... nah, that's too young.",michael

21055,You don't have one single girlfriend?,michael
21056,No...,pam

21058,Sorry.,pam
21059,"A kindergarten teacher, who is great with kids, maybe an ex-model, and now she wants to do something with her brain?",michael
21060,"No, I don't, I...",pam
21061,How 'bout a professional volleyball player who models on the side?,michael
21062,I just...,pam
21063,"You know, just a fun, guh, look, there, here, it doesn't have to be a model.  I'm not, don't rule out model, but just in terms of models, there are like twenty different categories.  There's face models, hand models, body models [Jim raises hand] - yes.",michael
21064,I actually know a sex model.,jim
21065,Really?,michael
21066,"Yep.  Yeah.  She's blind, is that a problem?",jim
21067,"No, I am, it's all about the personality, Jim.",michael
21068,Okay.,jim
21069,Are you talking about Beverley?,pam
21070,Yes.,jim
21071,Because she's not a sex model.  She's a tollbooth operator.,pam
21072,"Oh, yeah.",jim
21073,Send me a picture.,michael
21074,"So far, these are my leads.  A blind tollbooth operator and a twelve hundred pound catcher.  It's a start.",michael
21075,What's wrong Michael?,pam
21076,I got gum in my hair.,michael
21077,You do.,pam
21078,"This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it.",michael
21079,You've got a ton of dandruff.,dwight
21080,"OK, let me be.",michael
21081,How'd you get gum in your hair?,jim
21082,"I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanley's car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil.",michael
21083,"But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.",jim
21084,Kill me... right now.,michael
21085,We have peanut butter in the kitchen.,pam
21086,I don't feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich.,michael
21087,"Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am.",jim
21088,"No Dwight, not the good peanut butter. People are going to get mad.",pam

21093,Wow! Lot of calories.,dwight
21094,"Well just don't leave it on too long. Keep massaging please. Ah yeah, that's nice.",michael
21095,"Hey Michael, how was your date last night?",dwight
21096,[sighs],michael
21097,"I will be honest; the dating has not been going well. Look, men are visual creatures. We crave beauty, like a piece of fine art by any number of renowned artists, or an arty photograph of Cindy Crawford nude... that, but the women I'm getting fixed up with are, egh! Not that they aren't nice, or that have great personalities, they just... They just lack a certain... Crawfordness.",michael
21102,"Hey man, you mind if I run something by you?",jim
21104,"Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that.",jim
21106,Thanks.,jim
21108,Did I? I don't...,jim
21110,Hmm.,jim
21112,"Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention please. I know that a lot of you are very angry with Ryan because he is the reason we all have to come in tomorrow, however, I swear to God, If any of you hurts him in any way emotionally or taunts him or makes fun of his height or his half beard or...",michael
21114,Yeah.,michael
21116,Question.,dwight
21118,Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?,dwight
21127,I don't understand why our website has to have social networking at all.,dwight
21128,"Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.",jim
21130,And then an older gentleman asked you 'Boxers or briefs?',jim
21135,"[slow clapping] Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good.",michael
21136,Well it has been nice seeing you again my friend.,michael
21138,"Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad. [hugs Ryan]",michael
21140,Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me.,michael

21148,They sound great.,michael
21150,Would you have sex with Meredith?,michael
21151,What?,jim

21155,I know.,jim
21156,Let's go to New York. We'll go clubbing with Ryan.,michael
21157,I can't.,jim

21159,I'm not single.,jim
21160,Who you dating?,michael
21161,Pam.,jim
21162,That's still going on?,michael
21163,"Ok, Dwight grab your stuff, we're going to New York to party with Ryan and to meet girls.",michael
21164,Yeah!,dwight
21165,Oh yes! Count me in dudes. I am in some serious need of some bro' time. Old ball and chain's been a lot more chain than ball lately if you know what I'm saying.,andy
21167,"No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three.",dwight
21168,"Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Let's go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift.",michael
21170,I am going to go get laid. Goodbye.,michael
21171,[laughs] With sex!,dwight
21172,"That's... I, I think that...",michael
21173,"You know what? If we all stayed a couple of hours late tonight without Michael distracting us, we wouldn't have to come in at all tomorrow.",jim

21262,Phyllis.,pam
21263,"I umm, thought about getting a tattoo on my back as well at one point. I was thinking about getting 'Back to the Future.'  'Back' because it's on my back and 'Future' because I'm the kind of guy who likes to look ahead into the future. I just think a tattoo should mean something, you know? And it's my second favorite movie.",michael
21265,"Back to the Future? [she shakes head] Oh, wow. Well you should take a, a film education course.",michael
21267,Forty... I'm in my forties.,michael

21376,I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours.,dwight
21377,"Shh, just stop. Here's what you do. You tell him that you're his friend and that you're gonna help him and that everyone's gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who's selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people who's really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I don't understand a word of it.",michael
21379,OK. Good night Ryan.,dwight
21380,Best night ever.,michael

21476,Hold your breath.,dwight
21477,And in this case...,jim
21478,Ready?,dwight
21479,That's also not true.,jim
21480,And... go. [Michael sticks his face in the cement] Force it in as deep as you can.,dwight
21481,[muffled] That's what she said.,michael
21482,"Today is a very special day for me. And it's really not about me, it's about my grandkids, it's about my great grandkids... I can come back here when I'm 100, and I can find that piece of cement and say, 'That's me. Look kids, your daddy left that face hole...' I dunno, it's a good feeling.",michael
21483,"[playing with Madlibs] Okay, adjective...",andy
21485,"Good one. Okay, you ready?",andy
21487,"[reads] The tall man entered the nice building to visit a very nice man. 'Sit down, Mr. Smith, can I interest you in any good... cat food?'",andy
21489,What about a cat eating man food?,andy
21490,Andy and Angela seem very happy... I hope nothing horrible ever happens to them.,dwight
21491,"[wearing glasses] Um... yeah, I slept over at a, uh, friend's house and, I forgot my contact solution, so... I had to wear my backup glasses... Shut up.",pam
21492,"All right, everybody... Oh my God, Pam, those make you look so ugly. Um, Pam, in order to get hotter, you take the glasses off. You're moving in the wrong direction...",michael
21493,I don't have my contacts...,pam
21494,"Ub, dub dah, don't need, I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we're going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.",michael
21495,Ener-gize...,michael
21496,"You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly...",jim
21497,"Don't, don't--",pam
21498,Would...,jim
21499,"If you propose to me during a Michael meeting, I will say no.",pam
21500,"Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.",jim
21501,"Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?",michael
21502,"What if we changed our outgoing answering machine message, so it just had a little more... zing, and a little more pep?",andy
21503,"Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim?",michael
21504,What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?,jim
21505,"Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme...",michael
21506,An urban thing...,jim
21507,"An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley...",michael
21509,"Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group.",michael
21511,"Stanley, we're havin a little...",michael
21513,We're havin a little brainstorm session...,michael
21515,"...Good, this is good. I'm going to grab a glass of water.",michael
21517,"Ugh, what?",michael
21519,What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened.,michael
21521,That? In the conference room?,michael
21523,"We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said 'did I stutter,' and I said 'wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?' It was joking, Toby, alright?",michael
21525,"Well you don't get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you're... you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another: 'Hey um, you're poor.' 'Well hey, you're mama's dead.' That's what friends do. It's... you're so white.",michael
21527,Mmhmm.,michael
21529,"Okay, I will... I'm not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but...",michael
21531,"Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it's probably psychological.",michael
21532,"You meet a lot of ladies driving an Xterra, because you pull up to a stoplight, and look over and there's an Xterra next to you. They're always driven by chicks, so there's your icebreaker.",andy

21534,That's a racing stripe.,andy
21535,"Uh, bumper's sagging.",dwight
21536,"Mmm, I doubt that very much.",andy
21537,This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.,dwight
21538,How next to?,andy
21539,"Well, here are your options: you can sell it for parts, drive it off a cliff... you can donate it to a person that you'd like to see die in a car crash, or, you can sell it to me, and I'll use it as I would a wagon on my farm. It will be towed by a donkey.",dwight
21540,I have to pick one of those?,andy
21541,Yes.,dwight
21542,Can you go over those options again?,andy
21543,"You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now.",dwight
21544,"Well I have the, the blue book value...",andy
21545,"Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one--",dwight
21546,Can I think about it?,andy
21547,"Five, four, three, two...",dwight
21548,Let me think about it--,andy
21549,Now. Now. Now.,dwight
21550,Let me think about it--,andy
21551,Say it. Do it. Now.,dwight
21552,I'm thinking about it--,andy
21553,Do it now.,dwight
21554,Thinking--,andy
21555,Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.,dwight
21556,Yeah. All right!,andy
21558,"I, uh, see that you... gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal.",michael
21560,"Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn't mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned, so we are cool.",michael
21563,"Jim is in charge of Stanley only in sales-related matters, hence the green line--green for money-sales, get it?",dwight
21564,Uh huh...,michael
21565,There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...,dwight
21566,Great,michael
21567,"However, in so doing, it zigs past your name, hence zagging you and making you appear weak. Thus the yellow color. Yellow for cowardly.",dwight
21568,What's the pink?,michael
21569,Menstrual cycles.,dwight
21570,"Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?",michael
21571,You.,dwight
21572,Other than me.,michael
21573,"Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.",dwight
21574,I never said you could do that.,michael
21575,All you have to do it say it.,dwight
21576,I...,michael
21577,Just say it.,dwight
21578,"Okay, I will think about it.",michael
21579,"Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.",dwight
21580,No.,michael
21581,"So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself.",dwight
21583,"Oh, thanks.",pam
21585,"Oh, okay...",pam
21587,I should probably get back to...,pam
21589,Entering the....,pam
21591,"No. [Kevin leaves; Pam takes off her glasses; phone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Okay, go ahead. [puts a notepad close to her face and writes message]",pam
21594,Hey.,michael
21596,"Darryl, [clears throat] have you ever been in a gang?",michael
21598,"It's an advice question, and if you don't wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It's, um...",michael
21600,"I know, it's very, very personal...",michael
21602,"I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?",michael
21604,God.,michael
21606,Okay.,michael
21608,"Okay, so dig this: you're on the street, and one of your gang disses you.",michael
21610,"Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?",michael
21612,What is that?,michael
21614,Really?,michael
21616,I would've never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.,michael
21619,Oh boy...,jim
21621,"On a wing and a prayer, mostly.",jim
21623,A formal warning... [chuckles],jim
21625,"[stammers] I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head.",jim
21627,"I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really...",jim
21630,"Hey, what happened? What did Ryan want?",pam
21631,"Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...",jim
21632,Because you're very important?,pam
21633,Yeah...,jim

21636,It's my car now.,dwight
21637,I gave you a deal... based on what you said to me.,andy

21639,"I've got a Madlib for you: a stupid, idiotic, numbskull named Andy Bernard sold his Xterra to a smart and capable man named Dwight. This is shaping up to be an awesome day for Dwight.",dwight
21640,"Okay, everybody, shh! So, earlier today, Stanley sassed me, and Toby gave me some suggestions on how to discipline him. They did not work, obviously, because they were stupid, so I am now going to fake fire him.",michael
21641,What does that mean?,pam
21642,It's like a mock execution.,michael
21643,That's not a good idea.,jim
21644,Yes it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left.,michael
21646,"No, okay... I've had enough of you.",michael
21648,"Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay?",michael
21650,"I'm not firing him. I'm not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I'm going to do, is I'm going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I'm teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That's all I'm, okay, here he comes. Let's just... play act. [Stanley enters the room] Stanley, may I talk to you for a second?",michael
21651,"Stanley Hudson, you are fired.",michael
21653,"I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack.",michael
21655,Hmm.,michael
21657,"Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice.",michael
21659,That's it. And uh... do you have anything to say to me?,michael
21661,Okay...,michael
21663,Yes.,michael
21665,That's not-,michael
21667,"All right, all right...",michael
21669,Okay.,michael
21671,"Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out.",michael
21672,Who?,jim
21673,"Everybody, except Stanley.",michael
21674,Let's go.,jim
21675,I can't find my glasses.,pam
21676,"Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here.",jim
21677,"Okay, okay.",pam
21679,[starts to cry] I don't understand why you keep picking on me.,michael
21681,"You just, do, and I don't know why, so... please help me understand.",michael
21683,"Well Stanley, maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well.",michael
21685,"All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it.",michael
21687,"I am good person, and sometimes, good people don't get no respect. Rodney Dangerfield. [as Rodney Dangerfield] Hey, I don't get no respect. No respect at all. When I was in the sandbox as a kid, I got not respect. My wife likes to talk after sex, so she called me from a hotel room, and said, 'I don't respect you!' Ahh, thoughtless. Aw, you know what don't get no respect? Airplane food. Why don't they just make the plane out of the airline food? My wife don't get no respect, some--take her, please, for example. [as Jeff Foxworthy] If you don't get no respect, you might be redneck. [as Borat] Respect is niiice. Borat. [as Rodney Dangerfield] What's the deal with Grapenuts? No grapes, no nuts. I don't get no respect!",michael
21688,"So I'm thinking, as a reward for our loyal clients, that we contact their assistants, and we find out where they live. And then, we go to their houses, in the middle of the summer, and go caroling. It is a summer Christmas sale-abration. And we call it, a summer sales-a-lot. Feedback? Anybody? Stanley?",michael
21691,"Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis.",michael

21693,Who else is he mean to?,jim
21694,"Everybody.  He just, he's always, he's always talking about people behind their backs to me.",michael
21695,What kind of stuff does Stanley say?,pam
21696,"Like that people are stupid, and that they're idiots, and that they're sluts.",michael
21698,"Because he's mean.  He's, he's like a really mean-spirited guy.  He talks about how gay Oscar is...",michael
21699,Mm-hmm.,jim
21700,"And that Angela's a midget, and that [indicates Jim] your chin is too big.",michael
21701,Hey.,jim
21702,"I know, I know.  I think it's tiny.  I think it's too small if anything.  And that your glasses make you look ugly.",michael
21703,She's never worn these glasses before.,jim
21704,"Well, he's just mean.",michael
21705,"Michael, I think that what Stanley did to you was rude.  Maybe you should just get him aside and tell him that he was behaving badly.",pam
21706,"It's complicated, Pam.  I mean, the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk.",michael
21707,"Well, I actually agree with her, I think you should talk to him.  And you also might want to explain to Andy that no one wants to help him decide whether or not he has a rash.",jim
21709,Okay.,michael
21710,"I put Stanley on a pedestal, for a long time.  But sometimes he can just be a big, fat jerk.  I... jerks don't deserve to be on pedestals.  Jerks should be placed up somewhere where everybody can see how jerky they are.  Big marble... jerk stand.",michael
21711,"Pam, stand up.",michael
21712,"Hi everyone.  My name is Pam, and I wear glasses.",pam
21714,Pretty disgusting.,michael

I can't see any of the things that would bother me on a normal day.  I can't see anything disgusting, or ugly, or Michael... it's great.",pam

21759,"Okay, here's what we're going to do: I'm going to instruct the kids about management and sales. Oscar will be in charge of accounting. Pam will be eye candy. No... uh, also, because that is your alma mater. Darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse. We don't have to worry about internships with them, because they definitely ain't going to college.",michael
21761,Let's go!,michael
21762,"Today, I am meeting a potential client on the golf course, because Ryan put me on probation. You remember Ryan, he was the temp here. Yeah. And uh, it is not a good time for me to lose my job.

If you walk out that door, so help me, I will - [Stanley leaves] He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences.",dwight

21803,"Oh, no problem. [looks down] And he signed!  He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately.",michael
21805,I only brought the one.,pam
21806,Are you mental?,michael
21807,"Michael, do you remember, you specifically told me to only bring one sheet of paper? You said it only takes one sheet to make a difference. And I said, 'Are you sure Michael?'

21870,I want you to meet my family. Come on. Oscar Martinez. Accountant extraordinaire. This is Justin.,michael
21873,"This is Darryl Philbin. Isn't he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will 'do' you. [laughs] No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?",michael
21874,Excuse me.,pam
21875,"Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.",michael
21877,"So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn't bring are even better. Justin, I'm willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special.",michael
21879,"No, I didn't. You misconstrued me.",michael
21881,"I, uh, hmm.",michael
21883,Why don't... hey.,michael

21890,Count me in!,andy
21892,All right!,andy
21893,"Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?",jim
21895,Absolutely.,jim
21897,Right on.,andy
21898,"You know it's a tough thing, seeing a grown man take six shots to get out of a sand trap but, I had to give Phil credit for not quitting. Which is what I told him. I also told him I don't quit either, and I'd call him every single day until he gave me his business. Which he then did, after ...fifteen minutes of me blocking his car. So I am now his paper supplier! And I shot a 102 today, so I'm feeling pretty good.",jim
21900,"Hold down the fort, I have to do something. [walks up to microphone] Excuse me. If you can hear me, I'd like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&R Block? Come on, I mean I don't even know what they do. Frank Regan Funeral Home? Too much formaldehyde! The Air Force? [Airforce recruiter glares at Michael] Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, that's not what you want. Dunder- they,  well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin?  We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn... it. Okay, I'm gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe.",michael
21902,You're welcome.,dwight

21907,Well done.,pam
21908,"Thank you. You know what, screw this! [pulls Pam into a big smooch]",jim
21910,"Today I did something stupid. I questioned myself. And I will never do that again. Because I look at somebody like Jim Halpert and I think, that guy can do anything he wants to do. He could do anything, and he chooses to work here, selling paper. Just like me.",michael
21911,"[standing way too close to Jim and Pam] Yeah, kiss her. Kiss her good. [Jim and Pam stop kissing]",michael
21912,Hi.,pam
21914,"I was just wondering, what kind of jobs do you guys have?",pam
21916,Yeah. Can I fill out an application?,pam
21918,I can do that.,pam

21928,New York or Philadelphia.,pam
21930,Okay.,pam
21932,Thanks.,pam
21933,"Well, kids today have a very short attention span.  They are into texting and video games and sex, and they just, they get distracted easily.  And today they're being distracted by the other booths.",michael

21936,"That is a very firm handshake.  Ow, ow, aahch!  Killing my hand, there.",michael
21938,"So, what is your poison?  You like uh, sales, accounting, customer service, what do you like...",michael
21940,"Sales is and could be very, very cool.  If you like paper, and you love to laugh, this is the place for you.",michael
21942,Right here.  We have a lot of fun.,michael
21944,"[Pam returns] This is one of our staff.  This is Pam Beesly, [takes piece of paper from Pam] receptionist extraordinaire.",michael

21947,"Hi, nice to meet you.",pam
21948,Pretty nice.,michael
21950,She sits there all day.,michael
21952,You get to look at her.  Why don't you hold out your hand. [hands Brad paper] Tell me what you feel.,michael
21954,"That's called card stock.  That's what you're feeling.  Now what you're feeling inside is confusion, butterflies, exhilaration... You're thinking, 'Am I good enough for this job?  Do I have what it takes?'  And I think we both know the answer.  We'll find that out together.  You can keep that.",michael
21956,"Mmm, yeah.",michael
21958,"Don't fold it, though.",michael
21959,"We have the Dundies, my birthday, those blow out, and it's sexy, it's sort of a sexy atmosphere, you know?  The other day, in the parking lot, I actually found a condom.  So.  [to Pam]  I've been meaning to ask you, do you know whose that was?  [Pam shakes head no]  So, sexy is fun...",michael
21961,"Hey, you know what?  Coincidence - I am going to go for a little stroll myself.  Are you psyched about the summer?",michael
21963,"Yeah, me, too.",michael
21965,"Okay, be my guest.",michael
21967,And do your worst.,michael
21968,[to Brad coming out of the bathroom] Hey.,michael

21989,Okay.,michael
21990,Have you given any more thought to Dunder Mifflin?,michael
21992,"Well, yeah, but you don't need the brochure.  The brochure is up here [indicates head] and it's in here. [indicates heart]",michael

22004,Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.,jim
22005,[into Jim's headset] This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute!,dwight
22006,"Dwight left his cell phone on his desk. So, naturally, I paired it to my headset.",jim
22007,"[cell phone rings] K, fine. I'll just let it go to voicemail.",dwight

22026,"Today is Toby Flenderson's last day. I couldn't sleep last night. I came extra-early. So much energy... There are certain days you know you know you will remember for the rest of your life, and I just have a feeling that today is one of those days.",michael
22028,"Mornin'. [to camera] So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. I'm going to set my watch alarm... And... [watch beeps]",michael
22033,"First thing on the agenda-actually, the only thing on the agenda, is the status of Toby's going away party.",michael
22035,Okay.,michael
22037,"Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets...",michael
22038,"Do you mean, leaves as in dies? You want us to throw Toby a New Orleans' funeral?",pam
22039,"If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?",michael
22041,"Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga-",michael
22043,Toga!,michael
22045,I thought that you might say that. [takes off his shoe; hums; takes out cash from shoe],michael
22046,"Every year, my sweet, sweet grandmother sends me a check on my birthday for fifty dollars. And lately, she has been sending me, like nine or ten checks a year... uh, as Nana starts to... but, I knew I should be saving it for something, I just didn't know what I should be saving it for. And then I had an awakening. 'Michael, buy a motorcycle.' So I put the money in my shoe, and then I forgot about it until now.",michael
22047,"I want a party that makes me feel like I am flying through the air without this... ugly weight holding me down, you know?... I want an antigravity machine. I saw it in a movie. You drink a potion, and then you just start floating all around.",michael
22048,So how much antigravity potion do you want?,pam
22050,"Phyllis, can you do this?",michael
22052,"Hi, can I help you?",pam
22058,Hey. [kisses Jim on cheek],pam
22059,Hey... What?,jim
22060,Guess who just got into the Pratt School of Design.,pam
22061,No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations!,jim
22062,"Oh, thank you! I don't know why I doubted it, because I'm so clearly awesome!",pam
22063,Yes! So when do you start?,jim
22064,"I don't know, I didn't read it carefully, I just saw 'congratulations' and I skimmed the list, I saw my name, I came in here to tell you and get a snack.",pam
22065,Wow. Busy morning.,jim
22066,"So, you know it means I have to go to New York for three months...",pam
22067,"It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.",jim
22068,"Yeah, it sucks, but it'll be great.",pam
22069,See how easy that is?,jim
22070,Ohh... [they hug; she laughs],pam
22071,"I wouldn't go if things weren't so solid with Jim. And down the road, if we have a family, I couldn't go then either. So, the timing's perfect... And that is the first time I've ever used the word 'perfect' in here!",pam
22075,[watching from his office] Toby's replacement. Ugh. Wow.,michael
22076,So what do we know about her?,dwight
22077,"Well, we know that Toby thinks she'll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already.",michael
22078,I hate her too.,dwight
22079,Why do you hate her?,michael
22080,Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head.,dwight
22081,"You know, Dwight, sometimes... I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me.",michael
22082,Would that be such a bad thing?,dwight
22083,"Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do?",michael
22084,What?,dwight
22085,We need to sell her an elevator pass.,michael
22086,"But our, our elevator doesn't require a pa... [gasps]",dwight
22087,Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing.,michael
22095,[knock on door] Yeah.,michael
22097,"Oh, hey, do you still work here?",michael
22099,Nah.,michael
22101,No. I think I will pass.,michael
22104,"Hi. Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Here's how things work here: my job is to make the office fun. Your job is to make the office lame. And we have an eternal struggle, you and I. And only one of us can be the winner. Spoiler alert: I'm gonna win.",michael
22106,Yeah.,michael
22109,T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness.,michael
22111,Y-You can-Michael.,michael
22112,"Thanks to Toby, I have a very strong prejudice against Human Resources. I believe that the department is a breeding ground for monsters. What I failed to consider though, is that not all monsters are bad. Like E.T. Is Holly our extraterrestrial? Maybe. Or maybe she's just an awesome woman from this planet.",michael
22119,[whispering] Have you been introduced to Kevin?,dwight
22121,"He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain.",dwight
22123,Yeah.,dwight
22124,Hazing is a fun way to show a new employee that she is not welcome or liked.,dwight
22125,"Accounting department, listen up. Holly, Human Resources. Angela, Oscar, and Kevin. [accountants mumble hellos]",dwight
22136,"Here she is! Holly... You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we'd have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram?",michael
22138,I bet.,michael
22140,I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off?,michael
22142,"Oh... What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?",michael
22144,"You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?",michael
22146,All right.,michael
22148,Yep.,michael
22150,Do you like it? It's a photo of everyone in the office. So you can take it to Costa Rica.,pam
22152,Well I was taking the picture.,pam
22154,"Sure, do you have a camera here?",pam
22156,Okay...,pam
22158,"[on the phone] So I just got the fax closing the sale, and uh, it's big. It is really big.",jim
22160,Thanks.,jim
22162,I just-,jim
22164,"No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so...",jim
22166,"All right, well it already went through, so...",jim
22168,Hello?,jim
22169,[listening to 'Crash Into Me' on his computer] Hmm... Jim? [Jim comes into his office] I am downloading some N3P...,michael
22170,That's not it.,jim
22171,Music...,michael
22172,Yeah.,jim
22173,For a CD mix tape...,michael
22174,Close.,jim
22175,For Holly.,michael
22176,Mmhmm.,jim
22177,And I'm looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.,michael
22178,What are the two levels?,jim
22179,"The two levels being, uh, 'Welcome to Scranton'...",michael
22180,Mmhmm.,jim
22181,And 'I... love you.',michael
22182,Okay. Let's start with the 'I love you' level.,jim
22183,"Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2?",michael
22184,Yes. You don't love Holly.,jim
22185,I think I do.,michael
22186,But you just met her.,jim
22187,"Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears.",michael
22188,"Oh, okay, it doesn't work like that.",jim
22189,"Well, you're not a romantic.",michael
22190,"Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.",jim
22191,Oh really?,michael
22192,Yeah.,jim
22193,"Like, with who?",michael
22194,We've been through this.,jim
22195,Pam?,michael
22196,"Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.",jim
22197,"Yeah, you took it too slow.",michael
22198,"Well, we're really happy.",jim
22199,This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me.,michael
22200,"And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her.",jim
22201,I don't want her to get away.,michael
22202,"I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.",jim
22203,I was thinking... fireworks for the party. What do you think?,jim
22205,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.",jim
22207,"Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go. [hands her an envelope with money in it]",jim
22209,"Well we all want a good party, right?",jim
22210,I'm going to propose tonight. Holy crap!,jim
22220,"[on phone, leaving a message] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. Look man, I don't know what's gotten into you lately, but you know what? I really don't care, because you're trying to get rid of me. And I bet you don't think I care enough about this job to actually fight back, but you're wrong, because I do, and I will. So you can keep trying to push me out of this place, but guess what? I'm not going anywhere. [hangs up and exhales sharply]",jim
22222,"Hello, Holly. [Holly is on the floor with her desk chair in pieces] Woah, what are you doing? You don't, uh, you don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them actually.",michael
22224,"And the sequel, 'Woman Stands at Desk and Works.' So, I have no idea how you, [he sits on the floor] how you sit like that.",michael
22226,[as Yoda] Sit on floor and put together chair we will. [laughs nervously] Yo-da. Um...,michael
22228,"So are you in down this weekend? Cause, I'm not-I'm not... I'm not gonna be in town. I'm going out of town.",michael
22230,Kidding. [overdramatically] Acting!,michael
22232,[overdramatically] Acting!,michael
22234,Yeah.,michael
22235,I did it! [exhales],michael
22236,What'd you do?,jim
22237,"I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point.",michael
22238,"Wow. Okay, so how'd that feel?",jim
22239,It was hard. I wanted to kiss her.,michael
22240,"Oh, I'm so glad you didn't.",jim
22241,"Whew, oh God. [inhales] Laying a base. Laying a base...",michael
22242,"There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!",jim
22243,[giddy] Yeah...,michael
22252,"Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don't you go home, and come back for the party?",michael
22254,Yes we do.,michael
22255,"I'll let you in on a little secret: I've been very much looking forward to this moment. Very, very much. I-I have been steeped in anticipation. Toby has been cruisin' for a bruisin' for twelve years, and I am now his cruise director, and my name is Captain Bruisin'.",michael
22257,"Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend.",michael
22259,"Hey! Hi, good to see you.",michael
22261,I'm just having a little exit interview.,michael
22263,"Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the baler?",michael
22265,Okay.,michael
22266,[enters conference room] Did you need me to take notes?,pam
22268,Okay.,pam
22269,"Um... Alright, well then, I will proceed. [takes out note cards] I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Um... Who do you think you are?",michael
22271,Yeah. Correct. Um... What gives-what-what gives you the right?,michael
22273,Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I'll take a little look-see.,michael
22275,Thank you. [reads] What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin?,michael
22277,"Well, no no no no no...",michael
22279,No no no no no. I'm not asking it. I'm just reading it out loud.,michael
22282,[hides his face from Holly; whispers to Toby] I'll kill you.,michael
22285,"Toby, why don't you open your present?",pam
22286,"Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think... that I don't even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which...",michael
22288,What the hell is that?,michael
22289,Michael...,pam
22290,"That's... What do you mean, 'Michael'? That's not even my handwriting. [exits conference room] Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?!",michael
22291,You did.,dwight
22292,No!,michael
22293,You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just- [Michael slams conference room door in his face],dwight
22294,"Okay, you know what that is? You know what that is? That is... a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby.",michael
22295,So what is your gift?,pam
22296,"My gift is forthcoming, Pam.",michael
22297,What is it?,pam
22298,I am going to give Toby...,michael
22299,Your watch?,pam
22300,"...Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that?",michael
22301,I just knew.,pam
22302,How did you know?,michael
22304,Well... That's my watch.,michael
22306,"Hey, that's good.",michael
22308,Oh my gosh.,dwight
22310,Is that the police?,pam
22311,Yes.,dwight
22314,[still watching video of Ryan] Oh my God. Ryan... Oh my God.,michael
22316,Would you do me a favor and connect me to Ryan?,jim
22317,Absolutely. [dials and hands Jim receiver],pam
22318,"[clears throat] Right to voicemail. [into phone] Hey, Ryan, it's Jim. You know what? Totally disregard that last voicemail, because you obviously have your hands tied. Good luck! [hangs up]",jim
22322,[voice straining] I'm just worried about my friend.,michael
22324,"Just, I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I-I have a business to run.",michael
22326,I'm cool.,michael
22328,"Holly is sweet and simple, like a lady baker. I would not be surprised to find out that she had worked in a bakery before coming here. She has that kind of warmth. I'm pretty sure she's baked on a professional level.",michael
22331,"No antigravity machine, huh?",michael
22333,Ferris wheel's pretty cool though.,michael
22334,Wow. Look at our parking lot.,pam

22959,"See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you.",jim
22960,"If it's me, then society made me that way.  Now, I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, 'Why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?'",michael

[in Michael Clump voice]  When Michael Clump wants to remind you [normal voice] that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy.  And in order to be healthy, you have to eat, Kelly.  Kelly.

22999,Summers going great.  Just spent two hours listening to Michael Clump.  I have a weird pain in my left side that I'm convinced is an ulcer.  My girlfriend lives in New York and I haven't seen her in 10 days.  How's your summer?,jim
23000,"Hey Ryan, look.  Shaved off my goatee.  I am goateeless.  We are the goateeless brothers.",michael

23333,"I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but... [Dwight begins to turn around again, Jim holds up the watch] Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?",jim
23334,Is that anything like the original Battlestar Galactica?,andy
23335,"You know, it's weird.  It's practically a shot for shot remake.",jim
23336,"Really? [Dwight closes his eyes, clutches the paper in his hands] Huh, that's cool.",andy
23337,Story's kinda bland.  It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.,jim
23338,Really?  That doesn't sound right.,andy
23339,"I just don't want my employees thinking that their jobs depend on performance.  I mean, what sort of place is that to call home?  And Meredith needs this job.  This is her main source of money.",michael
23341,"Ok, new idea.  We don't report it at all.  We just punish her.",michael
23343,"Mmhmm, tell her she can't have sex for six months.",michael
23345,"I don't know.  I saw this thing, like a belt with a key.",michael
23347,"No, it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal.  You know what I am talking about.  You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the...",michael
23348,"He has not stopped working for a second.  At 12:45 he sneezed while keeping his eyes open, which I always thought was impossible.  At 1:32 he peed, and I know that because he did it in an open soda bottle under the desk while filling out expense reports.  And on the flip side, I have been so busy watching him that I haven't even started work.  It's exhausting, being this vigilant.  I'll probably have to go home early today.",jim
23349,I am just saying that I don't think that you understand what I am saying.,michael
23351,Yes.,michael
23353,Well... bleh busted.  I don't...,michael
23355,"Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.",michael
23357,I will be honest with you.  That car ride did not go well and that was not my fault.  The only reason I am standing out here right now is because I don't want to take the elevator with her.  And I am holding on to her leftovers. [throws Holly's leftovers in the trash],michael
23358,[Dwight walks back to his desk] 19 minutes and 48 seconds.  What were we doing for 19 minutes and 48 seconds?,jim
23359,None of your business.,dwight
23360,So I guess I can assume that was personal.,jim
23361,"[Dwight stares at Angela, buttoning the top button of her blouse] Fine.",dwight
23362,So maybe you're not completely ethical after all.,jim
23363,"Yes, maybe I'm not. [Dwight grins and gives a sly look at the camera]",dwight
23366,What's the only thing worse than one HR rep?,michael
23368,You get me.,michael
23370,"I don't know.  Can you?  Kendall, my main man.",michael
23373,Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.,michael
23383,"How do you tell somebody that you care about deeply, 'I told you so.'  Gently with a rose?  In a funny way, like it's a hilarious joke?  Or do you just let it go, because saying it would just make things worse? ... Probably the funny way.",michael
23385,"No way, lady.",andy
23389,"Ok, everybody listen up.  If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.",michael
23391,Get in there right now or I'm gonna lose it! [everyone gets up to go in the conference room],michael
23393,"Now is really not the time, Meredith.",michael
23399,"Wait a second, how does the steak factor in again?",andy
23409,Let's keep this rollin'... Ryan?,michael
23410,"Oh, but you mean other than embezzling?",jim
23412,Fraud.,jim
23439,"Oh, cr..., oh, God.  Meredith, you know what?  I just need a minute, okay?",michael
23441,What do you need?,michael
23443,I... really want to keep you.,michael
23445,"Wait, what?",michael
23447,Nnnngah!,michael
23448,[looking pregnant] Hey Michael?,dwight
23449,Yeah.,michael
23450,Contractions are coming every ten minutes.,dwight

23452,My cervix is ripening.,dwight
23453,"OK, good.",michael
23454,"[drawing two family trees on a whiteboard] Jan is about to have a baby with a sperm donor. And Michael is preparing for the birth of a watermelon with Dwight.  Now, this baby will be related to Michael through [draws a question mark] delusion.",jim
23455,Michael! My water's breaking!,dwight
23456,"Oh, OK! OK!",michael
23457,Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?,dwight
23458,I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.,michael
23459,Right. Highways or surface roads?,dwight
23460,I take Quincy Ave to Gibson.,michael
23461,"No, Gibson is covered in potholes.  Your car breaks down. Adapt!",dwight
23462,"I checked the route - there are no potholes.  Come on, get in here and have the baby.",michael
23463,It's about adapting to the circumstances.,dwight
23464,"[annoyed] Andy, would you like to have my baby?",michael
23465,Yes! Yeah.  [squatting and pushing] Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaa!,andy
23466,"No. OK, no.  I'm crowning!  I'm crowning!  Aaaaaaaa! [runs into Michael's office]",dwight
23467,"All right, OK. [to Andy] Sorry.  Sorry.  Here we go.  Here we go!",michael
23468,The pressure!  The pressure!,dwight

23479,[annoyed] All right.  Dwight.  Just push and breathe.,michael
23480,Numb me up. I want anesthesia!,dwight
23481,"Shhh. No, you can't have it.  It's too late.",michael
23482,No! I don't want natural!,dwight
23483,No.  You have to just push it out!,michael
23484,OK!,dwight

23486,Aaaaaaaa!,dwight
23487,OK!,michael

23489,Keep simulating.,michael
23490,Do you have the Sharpie?!,dwight
23491,"Yes, I do!",michael

23493,OK.,michael
23494,Ready?!,dwight
23495,Yes.,michael
23496,Aaaaaaaa!,dwight

23499,Nice touch.  Good.  Let's try that again.,michael

23501,"Hello ladies, how's my shower going?  Phyllis, did you get the live storks?",michael
23503,"Damnit, Phyllis!  I'm sorry.  [more softly] Damnit, Phyllis.  It was hard enough to convince Jan to come.  So are we set for refreshments?",michael
23507,She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So...,michael
23509,"I know.  I know.  It is beautiful.  No.  Thank you.  Is this it? I mean, is this... Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons?  You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up.  I think you need to get the lead out.  Because if I'm not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here.  We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower.  Well you know what, where's my golden shower, Phyllis?",michael
23510,"It does not matter to me at all whether this baby is biologically mine.  I am going to love it. It's like when the dog nurses the tiger cub.  Have you seen that video?  It is... it's so bizarre and unnatural, but... it, it happens.",michael

23521,"Right, the one from England.",jim
23522,"There's no one from England, Jim.  Katie studied in Ireland - this is Stacy, the one who does the Murakami-style collages.",pam
23523,"Oh. Right, that style.",jim
23524,"So, Stacy and Eric get to Bogre's DeTech half an hour early so they don't have to sit on the slab.",pam
23525,OK...,jim
23526,"Anyway, Bogre's TA Sarah Kaya comes in.",pam
23527,"Wait, who's Sarah Kayacombsen?",jim
23528,"No, Sarah Kaya comes in.  Don't interrupt, I have like thirty seconds to finish this and get to DigiPres.",pam
23529,OK.,jim
23530,"So Sarah Kaya says to Eric, 'No way.  You can't reserve seats.' And Stacy gets all up in her face and Sarah Kaya picks up Stacy's new PM pad and throws it at the light box.",pam
23531,[clearly just humoring her] No... way!,jim
23532,Yes!,pam
23533,Ha ha. That's hilarious?,jim
23534,"No, it's horrible!  Jim, she might get arrested.",pam
23535,"Who, Stacy?",jim

23541,Yo.  I got the Nard-puppy for ya.  What's going on here?,andy
23543,Awww.  Check it out - who would have thought that this little baby would be marrying that little baby?,andy
23545,Well -,andy
23547,"Why would that make me a pervert, I -",andy
23549,That's not you.,andy
23551,"That's mean, come on, that's - [Angela storms out]",andy
23552,"Ahoy, matey.",michael
23554,"Ahoy. So, how you doin'?",michael
23556,"Um, listen.  Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which I have a vested interest.  It's all kind of weird.  Anyway, she is incredibly... fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive.  And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office.  So, while she's here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you.  And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings.  And I'm treating Ryan the same way.",michael
23559,"[Jan enters the office, pushing a stroller] Jan.",jim
23561,What do we have here?,jim
23563,Really...,jim
23564,Oh no... [Michael enters and notices Jan's baby],dwight
23565,Jan had the baby and Michael wasn't there to mark it.  So the baby could be anybody's.  Except Michael's.,dwight
23566,So this is Astird.,michael
23568,"Oh, OK.  Why didn't you call me?",michael
23570,I could have helped.,michael
23572,"Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways.",michael
23574,"No, I don't!",michael
23576,Can I hold her?,michael
23578,"[cradling the car seat awkwardly] All right, OK.",michael
23579,"I love babies. I think they are beautiful in all sorts of different ways.  I try to pick up and hold a baby every day, if possible, because it nourishes me.  It feeds my soul.  Babies are drawn to me, and I think it's because they see me as one of them.  But cooler, and with my life put together a little bit.  If a baby were president, there would be no taxes, there would be no war.  There would be no government, and things could get terrible.  It actually, probably - it would be a better screenplay idea than a serious suggestion.",michael
23580,"[carrying the car seat] Ladies and gentlemen, it is my privilege and honor to present for the first time in her life and in the office: Assst...",michael
23582,"...trid Levinson.  Hi!  Astrid, this is everybody, look.  This is your family.  You're going to know them for the rest of your life.",michael

23586,"OK, come on, let's get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop.",michael
23588,"[sees Jan sizing up Holly] I'm fine, weirdo.  Such an HR weirdo.  Try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in.",michael
23589,Ready to play some games? Let's do it!,michael
23591,"Uh, duh.",michael
23593,"No, the baby doesn't ruin anything, Kevin, OK?  The baby multiplies the fun.  Let's just do what you were going to do.",michael
23595,"All right, how about some presents?  I want to see some presents. [holding a memo pad] I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes.",michael
23597,Whatta we got?,michael
23599,Oh!,michael
23601,She already has a stroller.,michael
23604,Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.,dwight
23605,"OK, what else?",michael
23606,"Twelve hundred dollars is what I spent on my whole bomb shelter.  For that kind of money, this stroller should be indestructible. [straps the watermelon into the stroller on the elevator]",dwight
23608,Hey you!,pam
23609,[on phone] Hey!  You busy?,jim
23610,Not even. I'm doing laundry for the first time in like a month.,pam
23611,"OK, OK, so you gotta hear this.  So, Jan's shower is going on right now, and she's singing 'Son of a Preacher Man' and everyone's just staring at her.",jim
23612,"I can't hear anything, there's like, there's like machines going-",pam

23616,OK.,pam

23634,"Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No.  No.  This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this.",michael
23635,I could have helped.,michael
23637,"[smiling] Uh, yeah.",michael
23639,"[voiceover] I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt... shortchanged.",michael
23640,Phyllis?  Could you take-.,michael
23641,Hey guys.,michael
23643,"Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another.",michael
23645,"Yeah, I a baby daddy.  Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby?  Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?",michael
23647,I just saw this baby daddy-,michael
23649,"Why, Darryl, because I'm quote white quote unquote?",michael
23651,Well-,michael
23653,It's- that's different.,michael
23655,That's not a baby.,michael
23657,[sighs] Could I?,michael
23668,OK.  Yeah.  Look at my finger.  Look.  Looook!,andy
23670,Look up here!,andy
23672,What? Sorry.,andy
23675,We're taking a picture.,andy
23677,She's nature's bounty.,andy
23680,"[sees Holly behind Jan] I was just going to...  I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene.  She smells like old tomatoes and dirt.",michael
23682,I like to call this... the bumper test. [drags the stroller behind his car and runs into it several times],dwight
23683,Sure you can't stay a little longer?,michael
23685,"All right.  All right, everybody, we're leaving.  Jan and Astrid are leaving.",michael
23687,Oh.  I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.,dwight
23690,OK?,michael
23692,"Wha - that's, I hate her.  Wha - God!  Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, 'cause I don't, but wha - OK, all right, fine.",michael

[lets it go, it flies off the curb, stays upright, and stops safely] Inconclusive. [pushes it out into the street, it rolls to a stop] Spartans would leave a weak baby by the side of the road.  My parents left me beside the road.  I crawled home.",dwight

23795,You're welcome.,michael

I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point?

24092,Thanks.  My costume's getting a lot of attention. [Pam is dressed as Charlie Chaplin],pam

24116,Ha ha ha. That's funny. [angrily] Take that sweatshirt off!  Hey buddy.,andy
24117,Andy.,dwight
24118,"Remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off? Totally joking. But, you should know, those colors are sacred. Not that I care. But if you're not a Cornell man, you probably shouldn't wear them.",andy
24119,"No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying!",dwight
24120,"Come on, you think you can get into Cornell?",andy

24132,"Well he's had a pretty good season so far--- Stop saying 'we.' You did not go to Cornell. Okay, you're just doing this to screw with me.",andy
24133,"Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage.",dwight
24134,"I know it's an excellent school, Dwight. I went there. My blood runs Big Red.",andy
24135,"Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.",dwight

24138,How are you Tom. Nice to see you.,pam
24140,"I asked Tom and Pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch! Pretty awesome, right? I think they're into the idea. They're probably thinking, 'That Pam Beasly, she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. She's the best! The absolute best.'",pam
24141,"Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. I'm gonna say that before ceramics class, I took off my ring, and then when I changed back out of my smock, it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it.",pam

24159,Was I?  Really? Was I saying anything interesting?,michael
24161,"All right. What's the scoop, how far?",michael

24197,That's what she said.,michael
24198,"Holly thinks that this relationship is over. Well, you know what? I am not gonna give up that easy. I'm gonna make this way harder than it needs to be.",michael
24199,Take that down. [Dwight has hung a large red Cornell banner from the ceiling],andy
24200,Excuse me?,dwight

24832,"I have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place. And I hate it. I can't tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I don't even know why I make it in such great quantities. Here's what we're gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry.

24873,"How did I propose, let me see... well, I drove her up to Nashua, and I had the ring, a big 10-carat diamond; it was beautiful. And I got down on my hands and knees, and a shooting star crossed overhead, and it just lit up the diamond like a shooting star. And we were in a restaurant, and I put the diamond into a cheeseburger.",michael

24876,Perfect.,jim

24885,Tell him you'd like to go with him.,pam
24886,We should take a look at those surveys.,jim
24887,"Why are surveys important? Okay, hypothetical: A man wants to buy 500 reams of....carrots. And, so he's like 'What do I do? Where do I go? Do I go to the insensitive carrot supplier, the insensitive carrot salesman? Or do I go to the nice carrot salesman, who will maybe charge a few cents more per ream of carrot, but guarantee next-day delivery on your carrots? Most companies need their carrots the next day. Now, substitute paper for carrots, and that is why surveys are important.'",michael
24888,"Great marks, Phyllis. [Phyllis walks out of Michael's office smiling]",michael
24891,"[hand up, seeking a high five] Up! Don't leave me hangin'! [they do]",andy
24892,"What do I do with my bonus check? [scoffs] Simple. Purchase paper from myself. Boosts my sales, which boosts my bonus. Last year I bought even more paper to make this year's bonus even bigger. Eventually, I'll get a bonus so big I can retire on it. And I'll use the paper to write my memoirs.",dwight

24898,"Dwight and I are both writing letters to our clients. I'm just sending a quick note to say how much I appreciate their business, and he is writing notarized letters to inform them them that lying on customer reviews is a prosecutable form of fraud and defamation. It's just... different styles.",jim
24899,"My job is to manipulate the customer into buying paper. In return, they give me money. I am the predator and they are the prey. Would a mouse give a positive review to a hawk? Should the hawk even care? [sighs heavily, nearly starts to cry] Excuse me, I've got work to do.",dwight
24902,"Hey, what are you laughing at?",dwight
24904,Are you laughing at me?,dwight

[pretends to kiss, then shoot imaginary person to his left]  Then I shoot myself, so I don't change history and create a paradox. BOOM! But right at the last minute, [contorts head sideways] I twist out of the way of the bullet. Nice try, history. Better luck next year.",dwight

25280,"Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David.",michael
25282,Yes.,michael
25284,"I learned a while back that if I don't text 911 people will not return my calls.   Um, but now people always return my calls because they think that something horrible has happened.",michael
25286,I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved.,michael
25287,"Also, it's icky back there.",dwight
25288,That's true.  People say it's icky.,michael
25290,"David, wait.",michael
25292,Is there no way we can get rid of him?,michael
25294,I have cause.  It is be-cause I hate him.,michael
25296,No.,michael
25298,I don't.,michael
25300,"[Dwight comes over, starts to massage Michael's shoulders] Don't do that.",michael
25301,"[pours something from the fridge into a bowl and opens the microwave, it is covered in exploded food] Oh, come on! [to the documentary crew] Do you see this?  Disgusting.",pam
25302,"So, Tunes, you still gonna buy your old man's place?",andy
25303,"Yeah, I am.  Wait, how do you know that?  I didn't tell you that.",jim
25304,"Ehhh no, I was just walking by your desk.  I saw some email.  I got peepers of an eagle.",andy
25305,That's really not cool.,jim
25306,Kaaw!,andy
25308,"Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you're right.",jim
25309,"Today's a big day.  Today's the day that I show Pam the house that I bought for us. Without telling her. But it's my parent's house, the house I grew up in and yeah, I bought it kind of impulsively. I mean, the price was good and I was helping out my mom.  It's got shag carpets.  I mean you can't blame my parents it was the 70's.  And why would you want to buy ugly wood from trees when you can have paneling? And a painting of some creepy clowns that is apparently crucial to the structural integrity of the building. [tugs and pulls in vain at the clown painting]  She's gonna love it.  Right?",jim
25310,Could you guys all do me a favor and not talk about this until I tell Pam?,jim
25311,"Whoa, you haven't told the misses about the castle?  You're in for a spanking my friend.  Myself and my lady? - no secrets.",andy
25313,"Oh thanks, Phyllis.",jim
25315,"Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry?",jim
25318,Definitely we should.,jim
25320,That is just obnoxious.,andy
25322,"Yeah.  Wait, what, the mess or the note?",pam
25325,Don't you think the person who left the mess is the obnoxious one?,pam
25326,"No, the note is way more obnoxious than the mess.",andy
25328,"Just because someone likes things clean, doesn't mean they're rich.",pam
25330,"You want to see some really high caliber acting?  Well, Mr. Kurt Russell, you are about to be served. [walks to the annex] Hey Toby, great to have you back, man.  Seriously, just a, just a real pleasure to see you again.",michael
25332,You're welcome.  Missed you.  Missed you as part of our family.,michael
25334,So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun?  That must have been fun.,michael
25336,"Nice beaches, pristine beaches?",michael
25338,Why'd you come back?  Why didn't you stay?,michael
25340,"I bet, for you.",michael
25342,"[shifting uncomfortably and sweating] Shhh hot, why didn't you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.",michael
25344,"Yeah, I am.  I am.",michael
25345,"I tried, I tried.  I tried to talk to Toby and be his friend but that is like trying to be friends with an evil... snail.  I feel like I'm dying inside.  I feel like Neve Campbell in Sream II.  She thinks she can go off to college and be happy and then, the murderer comes back and starts killing off all of her friends.  I learned a lot of lessons from that movie, this is just one of them.",michael
25346,"Okay, just summarize.",michael
25347,"Okay, fireable offenses include: workplace violence and sexual harassment.",dwight
25348,"That's it, that's it, perfect.  We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.",michael
25349,I love catching people in the act.  That's why I always whip open doors.,dwight
25350,"Mm.  Me too.  Okay, let's get this started.",michael
25351,Okay [stands up removes jacket and starts loosening his tie],dwight
25352,What are you doing?,michael
25353,[removes glasses] I am the bait.,dwight
25354,For what?,michael
25355,Men find me desirable.,dwight
25356,"No, no, no.",michael
25357,"Oh, it's a good day too. I'm wearing my mustard shirt.",dwight
25358,You're the bait for Toby?,michael
25359,Mmhmm.,dwight
25360,"No, for one thing, he's not gay.  And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim.  Or Ryan.  Or me.",michael
25361,Men find me desirable.,dwight
25362,"Yes, sure they do, Dwight.",michael
25363,"When it comes down to it, it's a health issue.  I should have written that.",pam
25364,"Mmhmm, yeah.",jim
25365,[looks up] Why aren't you as mad or interested in this as me?,pam
25366,"Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?",jim
25367,Are you inching away from me?,pam
25368,No.,jim
25369,Reach your arms out.,pam
25370,[laughs and swings his arm out which doesn't come close to touching the reception desk] I'm always this close.,jim
25371,"Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah.  Hello, Pam.  Jim may I have a moment with Pam please.",michael
25372,"Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so...",jim
25373,"Oh, oooh his mistress.  No. I'm kidding.  No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam.",michael
25374,"What do you need, Michael?",pam
25375,"Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson?  I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits.  Do not read it beforehand.  Can you do that for me?",michael
25376,"Good. [Pam stands up and starts reading note] N-no no no, don't.",michael
25377,"Please hug and kiss me, no matter how hard I struggle.  I'm too shy to tell you that I love you.'",pam
25378,"Pam.  Pam, you gave me your word.",michael
25384,"Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them?",michael
25386,Toby can I see those? Ooh. [takes photos and throws them on the floor] What's the matter?  What's the matter? You scared?,michael
25387,Those are fighting words.,dwight
25388,You mad? You mad at me?,michael
25389,I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you.,dwight
25390,"Do you want to do that?  You want to hit me, you want to punch me?",michael
25391,Hmmm?,dwight
25392,Huh?  He might do it...,michael
25394,I dare you to.  Come on.,michael
25395,Come on. [making karate moves] Baaah!,dwight
25396,What's the matter... haaaww!,michael
25397,"Hit him!  Hit him, Chicken.",dwight
25399,"Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who's side are you on?",michael
25400,"Ryan.  Come on, man?",dwight
25401,"No do it, do it.  I dare you.",michael
25402,Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.,dwight
25403,"Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch.  Come on! Come oooon...",michael
25405,Are you really not going to punch him?,dwight
25407,Son of a bitch.,michael
25409,I thought you were going to parcel those out through the day,dwight
25410,[mouth full of brownie] Just stop it.  You haven't done anything helpful all day.,michael
25411,There's still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.,dwight
25412,What's that?,michael
25413,"[goes over and closes office door] Frame him, for using drugs.",dwight
25414,Frame him?,michael
25415,"Yeah, it's illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal.",dwight
25416,"I've never framed a man before, have you?",michael
25417,Oh I've framed animals before.  I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present.  And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.,dwight
25418,Just seems awfully mean.  But sometimes the ends justify the mean.,michael
25419,"Hello.  I've seen you guys around.  I'm Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin.   How you doing?  [they stare at him] Uhghh, so I guess you know why I'm here?  I need to purchase something.",michael
25421,"No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some...",michael
25423,"Grass, weed?",michael
25425,I heard you drug---  I heard you dealt.,michael
25427,"I'm not wearing a wire, so...",michael
25430,How much? How many pounds is it?,michael
25435,Thank you.,pam
25437,"I know, can you believe it?",pam
25439,"I guess that's why we have a temp, huh?",pam
25441,How would wiping it with a paper towel make it worse?,pam
25443,"You've seen things cleaned before though, right?",pam
25446,"Hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  I forgot... I forgot...",michael
25447,"[on a cell phone in the hallway] Yes, I repeat a drug dealer is on the premisis of Dunder Mifflin.  His name is Toby Flenderson [Michael opens Toby's desk drawer and puts something in it] and he recently returned from a mysterious vacation in Central America.   I have risked a great deal to tell you this information.  My name is Andy Bernard.  Andrew Bernard, that's my name.  See you soon.",dwight
25449,I don't know anything about that.,pam
25451,Here?,pam
25452,"Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay?  Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy.  Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.  [leads them back towards the annex as Creed stands up and starts to put him hands up and then relaxes them behind his ears]",dwight
25454,"Those are real cops, real guns.  I wonder what's going on. [follows them]",michael
25455,"Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator.",dwight
25457,Search his things.,dwight
25462,"They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission.",dwight
25464,"Uh, you know what?  I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.",michael
25468,"Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.",dwight
25470,"Yeah, let's just cancel this, okay?",michael
25473,"No, no no no... No, no.",michael
25475,"No, that was... that was legitimate.  That was totally legitimate.",michael
25478,Oh God!,michael
25480,"No, no no no no.",michael
25483,"God! No, that's not... I don't know what that is.  And I... I bet he has nothing to do with that!",michael
25486,"Ahh, that's mine.",michael
25487,"No! Michael, no!",dwight
25488,"Yes, it's mine.",michael
25492,Are you kidding me?  That's my salad.,michael
25493,"So wait a minute, there's no drugs?",dwight
25495,"Gahh, dammit! [punches file cabinet] Come on!",dwight
25497,"Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him?",dwight
25499,[following them out] You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation.  Why don't you use them?,dwight
25500,You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.,michael
25502,Hmm.,michael
25504,Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.,michael
25506,"Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me, that's who you're worried about?  You're... you're worried about the cop's time?  You think I framed you, and you're worried about the taxpayer?  Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face.",michael
25507,You said you were leaving and you made liars out of all of us.  So...,michael
25509,"Yes, you did.  And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history.",michael
25511,Do you want to hear a lie?,michael
25513,I think you're great.  You're my best friend.,michael
25524,"[walking out of the building] Hey, do you mind if we make a stop on the way home?",jim
25525,Sure.,pam
25526,Cool.,jim
25527,[getting out of the car] What are we doing at your parent's house?,pam
25528,"I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now [spins her around once] open your eyes.  Tadah!",jim
25529,I don't get it.,pam
25530,"I bought it.  It's ours.  Let's go inside, I'll show you inside.  [walking inside] So if you can believe it I did it without a realtor.  Saving on closing costs is good and, uh, we can put all the money to de-shag the carpet.  Which I think will help, the color situation. [Pam walks over to the clown painting on the wall]  Yeah, I am really sorry about this.  I tried to move it but he is really nailed in there.  Worried about art theft, I guess, lot of art theives in this neighborhood.  [upstairs] This is the master bedroom but, I'm actually not allowed in here so... [shuts the door]",jim
25531,"[outside] So I'm still in the process of converting the garage.  It's got great light in here and I'm thinking, it could be perfect [opens garage door] for an art studio.  [Pam looks around and then looks at him] Look, I know, I bought this without asking you and it's doesn't look great, I know that.  And if you really hate it, I totally understand it's just---",jim
25532,I love it.,pam
25533,You do?,jim
25534,"Yeah, I love it!",pam
25535,Really?,jim
25536,"I mean, you bought me a house!",pam
25537,Oh my God...,jim
25538,You bought me a house!,pam
25539,"Yeah, I did. [they kiss]",jim
25540,"Um, do we have to sleep in your parent's bedroom?",pam
25541,"No, No, we'll just board that up.  It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.",jim
25542,And the clown?,pam
25543,"Yeah, I can't... really can't move him.",jim
25544,"What is my perfect crime?  I break into Tiffany's at midnight.  Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier.  It's priceless.  As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me.  She tells me to stop.  It's her father's business.  She's Tiffany.  I say no.  We make love all night.  In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms.  I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada.  I don't trust her.  Besides, I like the cold.  Thirty years later, I get a postcard.  I have a son and he's the chief of police.  This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero.  She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover.  I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin.  That's where I stashed the chandelier.",dwight
25546,Mmm... okay.,michael
25548,"Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old.",michael
25550,Yes.,michael
25552,There's the x-ax...icks.,michael
25554,"Mmhmm, okay.",michael
25556,Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five.,michael
25558,Ho-oh!,michael
25560,Yeah.,michael
25562,I'll be six.,michael
25564,So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus.,michael
25566,[whistles poorly] Whoo.,michael
25568,"Okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, I-I think I'm getting you...",michael
25569,"Guess what, everybody? Christmas has come early this year. Oscar, very smartly, has discovered an extra $4300 in the budget. Thank you, Oscar. And I have decided with that money I am going to buy a new, drum roll please... [imitates drum roll] Can anybody guess?",michael
25570,New chairs?,pam
25571,"No, a new copier! [only Oscar applauds] Unless everybody can agree on something better?",michael
25573,"Yes, Michael, new chairs. These chairs are terrible. We were supposed to get new ones last year.",pam
25574,So... we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?,michael
25575,"[over indistinct conversation] Good? Yeah, he said good, I'm good...",pam
25577,"Oscar, no. This is not the time for one of your principled stands.",pam
25579,Exactly. That should tell you how terrible the chairs are.,pam
25580,"Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, let's just decide and agree upon one.",michael
25582,"Alright, so, teams forming.",michael
25584,You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.,michael
25586,Michael?,pam
25587,Yes.,michael
25588,"I've talked to Meredith, Stanley and Jim about the chairs. I know they're with me on this.",pam
25589,"Uh, actually, I'm gonna go with copier.",jim
25590,What? Jim.,pam
25591,"Ever since Pam and I started dating, I just feel weird asking her to make copies for me. So, I make my own copies. And that copier sucks. Let me tell you, I-But you know what? Pam and I don't have to agree on everything.",jim
25595,Why me?,michael
25596,You have to make the decision.,jim
25597,"Wow, okay. Well... I swallowed all your ideas, I'm going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.",michael
25598,"Dwight, I'm a little concerned about some of these directions to Schrute Farms...",andy
25599,"Yeah, do tell.",dwight
25600,"I mean, like, '156 paces from the light red mailbox, make a left.'",andy
25601,Mmhmm.,dwight
25602,Walk until you hear the beehive.',andy
25603,How could it be more clear?,dwight
25605,Okay.,dwight
25607,"We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine.",dwight
25609,"Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on.",dwight
25610,"Let's three-way this little issue, and come to a solution by the time we get to Schrute Farms, how's that for a plan?",andy
25611,"We're getting married at Schrute Farms, no matter what. I have looked at twelve venues, I have lost eight deposits, and I have seen Angela naked zero times. I am not losing another deposit.",andy
25612,Hey.,pam
25613,Hey.,jim
25614,"So um, I've been thinking about this whole chair/copier thing...",pam
25615,Mmhmm.,jim
25616,I really think you should reconsider.,pam
25617,"Oh, Pam, I really... hate that copier.",jim
25618,"Yeah, I know.",pam
25619,Yeah.,jim
25620,But I really think you should reconsider.,pam
25621,"Beesly, are you threatening me?",jim
25622,"Jim. Jim, Jim, Jim. I'm not threatening you. I love you. [whispers] But you should know, you're on very dangerous ground [kisses Jim]. [at normal volume] All right.",pam
25623,Okay.,jim
25624,[shudders] Whew.,jim
25625,This is where you'll have your receiving line. Of course we'll clear out all the livestock and hay and such.,dwight
25626,"Hmm... mm, what's that smell?",andy
25627,You're gonna need to be more specific.,dwight
25629,Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.,dwight
25631,"You wanna eat, don't you?",dwight
25633,"Uh, Dwight, if we pay extra, could you slaughter the entrees the day before?",andy
25634,...I'll consider it.,dwight
25635,"See? That's how you do it! Makin' progress here. [steps in manure, trying to laugh it off] ...Darn! Heh.",andy
25636,There's a hose out back.,dwight
25637,Okay.,andy
25638,"Remember, you were gonna get a new chair, and you were gonna give your old chair to me. Remember that?",pam
25639,Yes.,michael
25640,Well that never happened.,pam
25642,I don't know. I haven't decided yet.,michael

25651,Let's go.,jim
25652,Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!,michael
25653,Let's do it.,jim
25654,All right! Cool!,michael
25655,Where we going?,jim
25656,I have no idea.,michael
25657,"So, I guess that's how they're gonna play this. It is on. [very serious] It is so on.",pam
25658,"Look, I really need this new chair. I mean, seriously, how is it possible that in five years I've had two engagement rings, and only one chair?",pam
25660,"Michael, that is hilarious.",jim
25661,"[through the laughter] Oh, is somebody making fun of me?",michael
25663,Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.,jim
25664,Aww.,pam
25665,Yeah.,jim
25666,"That's cool. [opens the container and smells the tiramisu] Mm, good stuff. [throws it in the garbage]",pam

25685,What?,pam
25686,Nine dollars. The boys' department.,michael
25687,No.,pam

25692,Yes they were.,michael
25693,Yeah.,pam
25694,They were.,michael
25695,Here's what I was thinking: everyone sits on a chair every day...,pam
25696,Mmhmm.,michael
25697,But not everyone...,pam
25698,Sits on a copier.,michael
25699,Or even uses the copier every day.,pam
25700,Yeah.,michael
25701,"Yeah, right?",pam

25721,"[Pam is making copies and is struggling with the machine] You might want to consider changing teams, because we would-we would love to have you.",jim
25722,"No, copier's great.",pam
25723,Yeah?,jim
25724,Yeah. I have my copies. [holds up messed up copies],pam
25725,There they are.,jim

25740,Mm! [gives Jim a high five] Yeah!,michael
25741,There's that ass!,pam
25742,Hey hey! Yeah! Unh!,michael
25743,"Woo! Yeah. Aw, don't take it away!",pam
25744,"Oh... ah, I almost choked.",michael
25745,Here's another place.,dwight
25747,Hey-o!,andy
25748,"So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here.",dwight
25749,[whistling Pachelbel's 'Canon in D;' switches to singing then back to whistling],andy
25751,I'm Andy.,andy
25753,He doesn't understand a word you're saying.,dwight
25754,What?,andy
25755,"Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad... [speaks German to minister; minister begins speaking in German] And away we go. This is a little taste of the ceremony, if you will. He's explaining why we're here, what we're doing here, making introductions, blah blah blah... Then he's gonna have Andy repeat a bunch of stuff. He's gonna ask Andy to produce a ring. I have uh, now just uh... just some twine for our purposes, and you will put the ring on her finger. Yadda yadda, then he's going to ask Andy, uh, if he would like to marry Angela. And you will reply, 'I do.' [Andy mouths, 'I do' silently] And then he's going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply...",dwight
25757,"And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife.",dwight
25759,Did somebody call Hank?,pam
25760,"Hank, thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads.",michael
25762,"Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue. [Hank takes some jellybeans from Pam's jar] Yeah, take as many as you want.",michael
25764,Yes.,michael
25766,"Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-",michael
25768,"Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.",michael
25770,"It is, yes.",michael
25772,What?,michael
25774,Okay.,michael
25775,You can try mine.,pam
25776,"Oh, there we go.",michael
25778,"Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.",michael
25780,"So, the copier.",michael
25782,"All right, yes.",michael
25784,"Well, what should I do?",michael
25786,"All right, get out. Get out.",michael
25788,I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything.,dwight
25790,"Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, 'I do.' And I said, 'I do.' And Andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness.",dwight
25792,"Yes, of course it does.",dwight
25794,It does in the state of Pennsylvania.,dwight
25796,"Haha, Mrs. Schrute.",dwight
25798,Wha...,dwight
25800,My... It's not my fault you don't understand German; I've been telling you to take it for years!,dwight
25801,"Are we, uh... are we leaving or what? [Mose hits Andy in the head with a deflated ball] Ow!",andy
25803,Hey David- [begins coughing violently] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I'm stopping now.,michael
25805,"No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm calling- [coughs again] I'm sorry.",michael
25807,"Mm. I'm calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.",michael
25809,"No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy.",michael
25811,The what now?,michael
25813,...Like a tip? [calculates amount] $645?!,michael
25814,"I hate disappointing just one person. And I really hate disappointing everyone. But I love Burlington Coat Factory. You go in there with $645, you are literally a king.",michael
25815,"[on the phone] We have that going out Tuesday... Okay? Sure, no, I can... I'll double-check that for you.",jim
25816,"All right, attention everyone.",michael
25817,Let me call you right back. Okay.,jim
25818,"I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is... [puts paper on glass and makes a copy, then takes paper from glass] working perfectly.",michael
25820,"Pam, would you stand up for a sec? [sits in Pam's chair] Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair. [slowly sinking into the chair] Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... it's a good chair. I think we're spoiled because we don't appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers?  [the chair has slowly lowered itself almost to where Michael is not visible over the desk] They don't have copiers. They don't even- [struggles to get up from Pam's chair] Gah! They don't even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this: I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.",michael
25822,Do I know what?,michael
25824,"Mm, no...",michael
25826,"Yeah, know what?",pam
25828,$645.00,michael
25830,Right.,michael
25832,Because that is how my mind works.,michael
25834,"Wait, what?",jim
25835,You can do that?,pam
25837,Let's see...,michael
25838,You're gonna give yourself a bonus of $645 instead of getting the entire office something it really needs?,pam
25839,"I don't need $645; I already have $645, more or less.",michael
25841,This is so stupid.,michael
25842,Or chairs?,pam
25843,"This is so, so stupid. And, God... [looks at his watch] that's my phone.",michael
25845,To be continued!,michael
25846,"No, I don't-this doesn't change anything. I have a very important decision to make. We need a new copier. We need new chairs. And I need to figure out a way to keep this money without having everybody hate me.",michael
25847,"Hey Tuna, check it out. Tuna sandwich. Just like you. [Angela walks over to Andy] What-",andy
25849,Was that hot or what?,andy
25850,So what's it gonna be?,pam
25852,"Let me just say, you've been promising me this chair since the day you hired me.",pam
25854,[groans in frustration] You think it's easy?,michael
25856,"Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I'm taking the bonus. All right?",michael
25857,"It is a classic management tactic. You have two sides, a deadline, you know that neither of them are gonna concede. What you do is you put 'em in a room, and you just- [Pam and Oscar come to the door of kitchen] Hey.",michael
25858,Hey.,pam
25860,What?,michael
25862,Thanks Michael.,pam
25863,Good work. I'm proud of you. [Pam and Oscar leave] Mother-,michael
25864,"[wearing a fur coat] What did we learn this week? Well, one, thanks to me, my team is much, much faster at coming to decisions than I thought they would be. Number two, never buy a fur coat with a credit card until you absolutely have the money to pay for it. And three, [camera zooms out to see fake blood is splattered on the fur coat] you should know that some people think it's cool to throw buckets of fake blood on you as you are walking out of Burlington Coat Factory.",michael
25865,Truce?,jim
25866,"Yeah, I guess, since I won.",pam
25867,"Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated. [begins to walk away, then turns back] Totally kidding. [leans in, whispers] I'm gonna need four. [kisses Pam]",jim
25868,What is this?,dwight
25869,"Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.",jim
25870,You're so pathetic.  How long did this take you? Three hours?,dwight
25871,Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.,jim
25872,"Yeah, no such thing.  They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid. [scoffs]  Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes.",dwight
25873,I think it'll take you a little longer than that.,jim
25874,"Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my -- [sets briefcase on desk and sits in chair, desk and chair are made of paper, Dwight crashes to the floor]",dwight
25879,"Hey, Phyllis, do I need this invite to get in to the party?",michael
25881,Awesome.  I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.,michael
25890,Ah. You brought in your doll collection.,jim
25891,"These are not dolls, Jim.  These are commodities.  Same as gold or oil.",dwight
25892,"Every year I do research to determine which toy will be the most popular of the Christmas season.  This year it's a doll. Half girl, half unicorn.  Catchphrase: 'My horn can pierce the sky'.  Pathetic. I bought out every store in the area over the last couple of weeks.  And as lazy parents become desperate I will sell them for an enormous profit.  Isn't that right princess? [makes doll nod]",dwight
25893,That's the Christmas spirit.,jim
25894,I am simply punishing those parents that would wait till the last minute to get their child a gift.  And such a genetically improbable one.  Look at that.  How does that happen?  King has sex with a unicorn?  Man with a horn has sex with a royal horse?,dwight
25895,Yes.,jim
25896,"Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn?  I thought they were all sold out.",michael
25897,They are now.,dwight
25898,Cool. [sings] My horn can pierce the sky.,michael
25899,"This is equal parts scotch, absinthe, rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, and two packs of Splenda. Call it a one of everything.",michael
25901,Alright... One more time around the block.,michael
25902,I will grant you one wish.,jim
25903,I wish that you'd stop rubbing that lamp in that creepy way.,pam
25904,Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes. [Pam laughs] Dumb.,jim
25905,"[sitting on floor playing the sitar] Hey, hey... Ange... check it out.  [sings] There's a place in France where the naked ladies dance. [laughs]",andy
25907,[sings] There's a hole in the wall where the men can see it all.,andy
25908,"Jim, Jim....",michael
25909,What is it?,jim
25910,That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice.  I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.,michael
25911,"Wow, that is delicious.",jim
25912,Yeah.,michael
25913,Can't believe no ones thought of that.,jim
25914,I know.,michael
25918,All right.,dwight
25920,"Oh, so glad I could help.",dwight
25922,Merry Christmas.,dwight
25924,Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-ka-ching.,dwight
25925,"[sighs] Oh, so this is what every day would be like if you hadn't left India.",michael
25926,"[Meredith's hair is on fire] Oh, oh, oh, oh!",jim
25927,We got a live one!  On fire!! [Dwight extinguishes Meredith],dwight
25929,Sorry.,andy
25931,"Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth",michael
25933,Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?,jim
25934,"No, no. I celebrate privately.",michael
25935,That's cool.,jim
25936,Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly.,michael
25938,We'll do it quickly.,michael
25939,Well what if we can't do it quickly.,jim
25940,[mimicking] What if we can't do it quickly? What if we cant do it--,michael
25942,"Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.",michael
25943,"An intervention.  It's sort of hard to describe, but really its-- it's a coming together... it's a surprise party for people who are-- who have addictions.  And you get in their face and you scream at them and you make them feel really badly about themselves.  And then they stop.",michael
25947,"Okay, how do you feel?",michael
25949,Uck... T.M.I.,michael
25951,Yeah.,jim
25952,"Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.",michael
25954,I am not asking her to stop drinking.  I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.,michael
25956,"Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand. [everyone raises their hand]",michael
25957,Aye.,dwight
25958,The aye's have it.,michael
25960,"Alright, well, let's look at this a little bit closer then shall we? [pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket]",michael
25961,"When I was in college I used to get wicked hammered. My nickname was puke.  I would chug a fifth of socos, sneak into a frat party, polish off a few people's empties, some brewskies, some Jell-O shots, do some body shots off myself, pass out, wake up the next morning, puke, rally, more soco, head to class.  Probably would have gotten expelled if I had let it affect my grades, but I aced all my courses.  They called me Ace.  It was totally awesome.  Got straight B's.  They called me Buzz.",andy
25962,"Meredith, have you ever used alcohol to alter your mood or deliberately change your state of mind?",michael
25964,Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?,michael
25966,Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?,michael
25968,"I got it on a website, that's not important.",michael
25970,"Okay, you know what Toby?  One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this.  I'm doing your job man.  Hey, are you texting?",michael
25972,"Alcohol is a drag. Yes.  Here's what I'd like to do.  I'd like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us.  I'll begin.  This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this.  That's how your drinking affected me.  Anybody else?  Another time when Meredith's drinking affected you?   Come on people.  If we don't say anything she's not going to get any better.  [Kevin raises his hand] Yes, Kevin.",michael
25974,That's-- you didn't-- you weren't hurt by that.,michael
25977,"Okay, no, that's not what we're going for.  Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking?  It has to bother you.  It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you?  Dwight, don't you have anything?",michael
25978,"No, I like Meredith.",dwight
25979,"Actually, I don't care for Meredith, but I don't believe in this kind of thing.  In the Schrute family we believe in a five fingered intervention. [holds up his fist] Awareness, education, control, acceptance and punching.",dwight
25980,Who is going to tell us the latest dirty joke?  Who is going to tell us what you watched on television last night?,michael
25982,"Was John Belushi fine?  Was Bob Hope fine?  Hey-- come here.  If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.",michael
25984,I want you to say I'm an alcoholic.,michael
25986,"You can say it as loudly as you want, but we're not going to believe you.",michael
25995,"[amid groans from the rest of the office] Alright, no, no, no.  No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting.  But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today.  What about tomorrow.?  What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead?",michael
25996,I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.,dwight
25997,"There are several ways to kill a zombie, but the most satisfying one is to stab it in the brain with a wooden stick.",dwight
25998,"Everyone in this room loves you, but mark my words, we are not going to support your alcoholism anymore.  The next time you light yourself on fire we are not going to help put you out.",michael
25999,"Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.",dwight
26000,Dwight--,michael
26001,She is a hazard to the other people of the office.,dwight
26002,[sighs]...okay.,michael
26003,I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.,dwight
26004,"Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.",jim
26005,"Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks.",dwight
26007,Really?,dwight
26010,"Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.",jim
26011,"Enabler!  Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler.  It's Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.",michael
26012,"You know what the only thing I want for Christmas? I want Meredith to get better.  That's my only wish.  But you know what?  My wishes never come true, so I'm not going to wish that on her. I-- a watch would be nice.",michael
26013,[watching Meredith and Michael talk in his office] They've been in there for 45 minutes.,jim
26014,"I know.  If she wasn't an alcoholic before, she is now. [Jim laughs]",pam
26017,[Andy playing the sitar] Hey.,jim
26018,What's up?,andy
26019,Do you take requests?,jim
26020,Sure.,andy
26021,Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.,jim
26022,[whispers to Meredith] I'll be down in a minute. [walks over to Toby] Could you write down the number of that rehabilitation center that you mentioned?,michael
26025,We did?,michael
26027,"Oh, shoot.  Oh well, we'll have to go someplace else then I guess.",michael
26029,"We could go there, sure.",michael
26031,"Yes, yes.",michael
26033,I have a new place.,michael
26035,"It-- yep, recently.",michael
26037,All right.,michael
26039,"Yeah, oh there you go.",michael
26041,That's good.,michael
26043,We're party girls.,michael
26048,$200.00,dwight
26051,"Oh, that's my last one.",dwight
26055,Not my problem.,dwight
26066,It's okay. It's all right.,michael
26068,"Meredith, we are doing this for your own good.  Okay. Come on--",michael
26070,Here we go. This is gonna be good.,michael
26072,Yes you are. [tries to pull Meredith from the car],michael
26075,Shhh... just calm down.,michael
26077,[chasing Meredith] Come on. Shh...,michael
26079,Here's the door. Here's the door.,michael
26081,[dragging Meredith on the floor into the rehab center] Let's start meeting-- Hello. How are you?,michael
26084,I have a deposit.  Alcoholic.,michael
26086,So do I sign?,michael
26095,Well don't look so surprised.,dwight
26096,I knew it.,pam
26097,You did not know it.,jim
26098,I knew some of it.,pam
26099,Everyone knew some of it.,jim
26100,It's Christmas.,pam
26101,You knew it.,jim
26102,Thank you. I knew it.,pam
26103,She knew it.,jim
26104,As it turns out you can't just check someone into rehab against their will.  They have to do it voluntarily.  They have to hit rock bottom.  So I think I know what I need to do at this point.  I need to find ways to push Meredith to the bottom.  Um... I think I can do it.  I did it with Jan.,michael
26105,"All right, everybody's still here.  Perfect! Got a little surprise I've been working on.  Angela, my bride, I just wanted you to know that for the rest of our lives, no matter the cultural milieu, I will always be there to bring you Christmas cheer.  [sings] Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Tis the season to be jolly. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.  Don we now our gay apparel. Fa-la-la-la-la-LA.  Troll the little Yule tide carol. Roo-di-di-di-do. Roododododo. [laughs]",andy
26107,"Sure. Dooo. Tough room. [chuckles] Come on. I just learned it.  Just so you know protocol is a little round of applause. But, Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.",andy
26108,"[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. I'm sorry, he's not in yet. Would you like his voicemail?",pam
26109,"[heard yelling from the street] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!",michael
26110,"Angela made several 911 calls about cars going too fast in front of the building, so the police put up a radar gun. It's actually caused a bit of a traffic hazard.",pam
26111,[yelling as he runs past the radar gun] Aah!,dwight
26113,Yes!,dwight
26114,"No. No, no. There was wind.",michael
26115,I was just jogging.,dwight
26116,"Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.",michael
26117,"No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.",jim
26118,I want another try. Here we go! [Michael runs past the radar as a car passes] Thirty-one! Thirty-one!,michael
26120,I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.,michael
26122,"Go, Oscar. Thirty-one's my number.",michael
26124,Beat it!,michael
26125,"Today's a big day. My presence has been requested by [in an authoritative voice] Chief Financial Officer, David Wallace. [in normal voice] He says that he wants to talk about big picture stuff. And, I'll be honest, I have little or no idea what that means, so... probably bad.",michael
26126,"Quick announcement: new year, new candy.",pam
26128,"Okay, be careful, Kevin. They're kind of spicy.",pam
26130,Yeah.,pam
26132,"So, maybe just try one at first, and then if it's okay, have a couple more...",pam
26133,"[entering the office] Excuse me, everyone, can I have the floor please? Um, this is insanely awkward. It's kind of the elephant in the room, so I'll just... [sighs] No one has RSVP'ed to our wedding yet, and the deadline was yesterday.",andy
26134,"Wait, you still don't know...",michael
26135,"[getting up quickly to silence Michael] No, no. Nope.",jim
26136,Hmm?,andy
26137,Nothing.,jim
26138,You still don't know.,michael
26139,Why don't... Let's...,jim
26140,[to Jim] What are you doing?,michael
26141,How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...,jim
26142,Andy.,michael
26143,Ahh! [ushers Michael into his office],jim
26144,"No, no one has RSVP'ed, and I don't understand it, and now, you're shutting me out. You're not even listening. That's really considerate. Thank you.",andy
26145,"[from inside his office] No, what I'm saying is...",michael
26146,"No, no.",jim
26147,"No, that's not it.",michael
26148,I know.,jim
26149,"Andy still doesn't know that Angela's having an affair with Dwight. And it's been seventeen days. I mean, eventually he'll figure it out, when their kids have giant heads and beet-stained teeth. But right now it's just... awkward.",jim
26150,[sighs] How can he still not know?,michael
26151,We can't figure that out.,jim
26152,I can't take it anymore.,michael
26153,"Wait, what?  You can't take what?",dwight
26154,I am telling Andy.,michael
26155,No. You can't do that. It shouldn't come from you.,dwight
26156,"Who should it come from, then?",michael
26158,[to Dwight] Are you still having intercourse with her? [Dwight's expression implies 'yes'],michael
26160,Did you ever have intercourse in this office? [Dwight's expression implies 'yes'],michael
26162,[coolly] Seems like you already know where.,dwight
26170,"[on the phone] That cannot be true! [Dwight jumps] You're going to charge me a fee to cut my own cake? Uh, no. No, no, no. What I'm saying is, I want to cut it myself...",andy
26171,[whispering to Jim] Trade seats with me.,dwight
26172,No.,jim
26173,I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.,dwight

26190,When what? [clears throat] When what?,andy
26191,You know this can't go on.,michael
26192,What can't go on?,andy
26193,We have to put an end to this.,michael
26194,Seems like...,andy
26195,Come on. [Dwight and Jim follow into Michael's office],michael
26196,You guys should... be hearing what I'm saying.,andy
26197,This is really not how this is supposed to happen.,jim
26198,Angela said she was going to tell him. She's just not ready.,dwight
26199,When will she be ready?,michael
26200,I don't know.,dwight
26201,Is she crazy in bed?,michael
26202,[boastfully] Yes.,dwight
26203,Stop. What?,jim
26204,"How so, specifically?",michael
26205,"Okay, listen.",jim
26206,Eager.,dwight
26207,This shouldn't happen at work.,jim
26208,And flexible.,dwight
26209,And!,jim
26210,Really?,michael
26211,This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.,jim
26212,It's too late.,michael
26213,"Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything.",jim
26214,I am already walking.,michael
26215,"Michael, once this gets out... I don't know how it's going to go down.",dwight
26216,"Okay, what does that mean?",michael
26217,Might get ugly.,dwight
26218,"[sighs] Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.",michael
26219,But you're leaving...,jim
26220,"[to Michael, who opens the door to leave] Have a good trip.",dwight
26221,Thanks. [to Andy] Andy?,michael

26223,Walk with me.,michael
26224,"Will do, boss-man.",andy
26225,"Ohh, I do not have much time... car's all the way over there, to tell you what I have to tell you. And just bear in mind when I say... say these things, that... are bad things... that you hear... in your ears... this is something that I, if I were you, that I wouldn't want to hear...",michael
26226,You're not making any sense.,andy
26227,"Well... no, I'm not. So I... I'm not very articulate today, so I'll just leave it for another time. Another day.",michael
26228,All righty.,andy
26229,Which will be fine. I am off!,michael
26230,Have a good meeting!,andy
26231,Thank you! [gets into his car],michael
26232,[through the car window] Kick Wallace's ass!,andy
26233,"[through the car window] Okay. I will... Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so...",michael
26234,I can't hear you through the glass,andy
26235,[rolls down car window] Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They've been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.,michael
26236,What?,andy
26237,All right. See you later. [backs out of the parking space] Ahh.,michael
26238,Are you serious?,andy
26239,Yep. [drives off],michael
26243,[to Dwight] What are you standing for?,jim
26244,"If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin.",dwight
26245,You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.,jim
26246,"If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to.",dwight
26247,"Dwight, I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit...",jim
26248,[enters the office and walks to Angela] I need to talk to you.,andy
26250,I need to talk to you in private.,andy
26252,Let's go to the conference room.,andy
26253,Is it true?,andy
26255,That you're sleeping with Dwight.,andy
26257,Is it true?,andy
26259,Just answer the question. Are you sleeping with Dwight?,andy
26261,How long has it been going on?,andy
26263,Who else knows about it?,andy
26265,Who else?,andy
26267,Oh God. Come on!,andy
26269,Right what?,michael
26271,"David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don't ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter... where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where you've been... ever. For any reason, whatsoever.",michael
26272,"Sometimes I'll start a sentence, and I don't even know where it's going. I just hope I find it along the way. Like an improv conversation. An improversation.",michael
26273,"This is going to sound sort of high-maintenance, but could we have it, like, three degrees cooler in here? I always think better when it's cooler.",michael
26275,"[pokes his head in] Hey, what say we order up some pasta?",michael
26278,"So like, missionary...",andy
26280,Do you love him?,andy
26282,Why should I believe that?,andy
26284,Who says that?,andy
26286,Where's Dwight?,andy
26287,"You okay, man?",jim
26288,"No. Not at all, actually. But thanks for asking. Appreciate it. You know what? I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for lying. To my face. And not telling me what's been going on this entire time.",andy
26290,[Dwight enters] Dwight.,andy
26291,Andy.,dwight
26292,It's over.,andy
26293,Oh good. She broke up with you.,dwight
26294,No. It's over between you two.,andy
26295,"Uh, no way. I am not giving up.",dwight
26296,You have to.,andy
26297,No I don't.,dwight
26298,[forcefully] She doesn't love you. She's marrying me.,andy
26299,"[angrier] Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.",dwight
26300,Angela Bernard.,andy
26301,Will never be her name.,dwight
26302,It will be her name. And you will have to call her that!,andy
26303,I don't think so.,dwight
26304,"Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit?",jim
26305,I'm telling you to back down.,andy
26306,And I'm telling you that I will never back down.,dwight
26307,Then I'll make you.,andy
26308,Oh really? How are you gonna do that?,dwight
26309,Through the use of force.,andy
26310,"That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.",dwight
26311,I will fight you.,andy
26312,Nope.,jim
26313,"Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela.",dwight
26314,Fine!,andy
26315,Fine!,dwight
26317,What is your weapon?,dwight
26318,"Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because...",jim
26319,"Hey, this is none of your business.",dwight
26320,Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.,jim
26321,Guess what? Not happening at work.,andy
26322,Yes!,dwight
26323,We're gonna do it outside.,andy
26324,Outside of work.,dwight
26325,None of your business.,andy
26326,None of your business then. [Dwight and Andy high five] Good. So what weapon?,dwight
26327,My bare hands.,andy
26328,That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.,dwight
26329,Then I'll get something too.,andy
26331,"Angela, you have to put a stop to this right now.",pam
26333,Of course you will.,pam
26335,I will be taking my break at 4:00 in the parking lot.,andy
26336,I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.,dwight
26337,[softly] What a coincidence.,andy
26338,Mm.,dwight
26339,"So, I either get more involved, or I take a sick day... leaving Dwight in charge. Oh God.",jim
26340,[collects Dwight's weapons from around the office; holds up a hand scythe],jim
26341,[innocently] How'd that get there?,dwight
26343,Thanks Meredith.,jim
26344,"So I was in the office, and I look over to our Accounting division, and there is Kevin Malone. Kevin is wearing a jacket that I've never seen before. And I call over to Kevin, 'Kevin, is that a tweed jacket?' And he looks at me and he says, 'Michael, yes it is a tweed jacket.' And I look back at him and I say, 'I feel the need!... The need for tweed.'",michael
26346,"[rises] Oh, thank you.",michael
26348,"I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me.",michael
26350,Okay. [sits back down to continue eating],michael
26352,[shouting] Come on! Where are you? Let's do this thing! Come on! Come on out!,dwight
26355,Come on!,dwight
26357,Where are you?,dwight
26360,"Come on, coward! Where are you? Where... [spots a note attached to the bushes; goes to read it] 'From the desk of Andrew Bernard.' [scoffs] A note. Pathetic. 'Dear Dwight, by now you have received my note. How are you? I am well. You are no doubt wondering why I have left this note. It has come to my attention that in any physical match with you, I would surely be bested.' True. 'The soft underbelly of my refined upbringing is my soft underbelly...'

26365,"[still reading] Alas, after much consideration and deliberation...",dwight
26366,Oh my God!,pam
26369,Whoa! What are you! Hey! Hey!,dwight
26370,Yeah.,andy

26376,You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her! [hits his car with the bike chain] All you do is dress fancy and sing. [imitating Andy] 'La la la la la la la la la la!' What does that mean? You can't even protect her!,dwight
26377,"Protect her from what? Bears, you idiot? When's the last time you saw a damn bear in Scranton?",andy
26378,"Last year, idiot! [hits his car with the bike chain]",dwight

26380,No. My right one's falling asleep a little bit.,dwight
26381,"Andy, are you all right?",jim
26382,"Go away, Tuna! I'm winning this!",andy
26383,"Yeah, back off. This isn't your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost? [hits his car with the bike chain] Oh! What? Trust fund will take care of that! [hits his car with the bike chain]",dwight
26384,"What did you say? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.",andy

26389,What?,dwight
26390,What!,andy
26391,She's sleeping with you?,dwight
26392,I'm her fiance.,andy
26393,She said she was only sleeping with me.,dwight
26394,"[enters, followed by Dwight, and makes a call] Yes, hi, my last name is Bernard, and I would like to cancel a wedding cake that I had ordered. B-E-R, N-A, R-D. Yeah, the one shaped like a sailboat... Yep, that's the one.",andy
26395,[picks up his bobblehead and throws it in the trash can],dwight

26400,Looks like a red wire.,jim
26401,Hmm. It wasn't here before.,dwight
26402,"Well it's a computer Dwight, computers have wires.",jim
26403,Yours doesn't.,dwight

26405,"No, it's going in a different direction then the other wires.",dwight

26453,"Okay, let's go over the plan again.",dwight
26454,"Alright, I am a local business owner. [Dwight nods along] I need to buy paper.  I find out everything about their prices and policies",michael

26460,[interrupting] No.,michael
26461,...and then we compare notes.,dwight

26470,Store only has three employees.,dwight
26471,So what?,michael
26472,It means they are not expanding.,dwight
26473,Maybe they are shrinking.,michael
26474,No.,dwight
26475,They could be shrinking.,michael
26476,No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.,dwight
26477,Ah ha [popping something in his mouth] Yup.,michael
26478,"[spying through binoculars] Its lunch time, and no sign of anyone coming in or out. Which means they are not taking new customers out to lunch.",dwight
26479,Mm hmm .,michael
26480,Which Means they're not acquiring new business. So once again no growth.,dwight
26481,"And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business.",michael
26482,"Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.",dwight

26490,"In nature, there is something called a food chain; it's where the shark eats a little shark. And the little shark eats a littler shark. And so on and so on. Until you get down to the single cell shark. So now replace sharks with paper companies and that is all you need to know about business.",michael

26495,Thank you.,michael
26497,We are a law firm.,michael
26499,"You know, I will be honest with you... about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn't feel like a priority. So I guess my question [reaches for paper in his pocket with questions on it] for you would be [reading off sheet] how many clients do you have?",michael
26501,Really? That many? This doesn't seem like a very big operation.,michael
26503,"Ah, so when did you set up shop?",michael
26505,"Oh Vietnam, I hear it's lovely .",michael
26507,Each side will have three minutes to prepare opening arguments. Topic: Hillary Swank is attractive.,andy
26512,"Okay, TMI.",andy
26513,"So, even specialty paper, say 94 brightness double-bonded, you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?",michael
26515,Well that is... because... I am a genius.,michael
26517,"Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup? [picks up tape dispenser and makes drinking motion] Is this the cup? [picks up a stapler and makes drinking motion] Is this what I drink out of? [glug noise, both laugh] Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession.",michael

26520,Why don't you just get rid of this guy? [points to Prince Son],dwight
26522,"I'm your son now; you can visit him on holidays. Dwight Schrute, I'm a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin.  I'm the top salesman there and I'm looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients?",dwight
26523,Try 80.,michael
26524,"Pshaw, that's nothing. I've 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business.",dwight
26526,Me too. [smirking],dwight
26527,"I think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mythical figures, you know? We don't really see them as real so therefore we don't judge them as real people.",jim
26532,"Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you [in a more and more seductive voice] and says Kevin Malone, I just read your online profile and there is nothing I would rather do then make out with you right now. And now you tell me something, is she hot? [Kevin gets up to join the 'hot' team to their great joy] Does that end the debate?",jim
26535,[fingers opened an inch] This close.,jim
26537,"My boss, his insensitivity might border on cruel. This is a man who does not listen to the needs his underlings. [Michael takes offense and charges over]",dwight
26538,"Hey, hey, how is your interview going?",michael
26539,It's going very well.,dwight
26540,"Don't blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you?",michael
26542,"I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great [positioning her towards sign of Prince Family Paper customers] Just a little something to remember the trip by. A little to your left [positions Linda to get better picture]",michael
26545,"What's going on?  Little homework over here? Lets see if I can help. Huh, math, that's not so hard. Ok. There are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right?",michael
26547,"Why is this little 2 so small? It's, it's weird, you don't, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4?",michael
26549,Excellent! Way to go! Nice! [Michael and granddaughter Prince exchange high fives],michael
26552,[disapprovingly] Kevin!,pam
26554,OH! [the 'yes she's hot team' claps],jim

26623,That is true.,michael
26624,Yes.,dwight
26625,That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times.,michael
26626,Yeah.,dwight
26627,Jan... Ryan.,michael
26628,"Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don't do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us.",dwight
26630,"There was a terrible war, ugh, so many died. Far too many died. But if Frodo hadn't destroyed the ring, then goodness itself might have died.",dwight
26631,You're right.,michael
26632,Yeah.,dwight
26633,You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info.,michael
26634,"Good, so, [Michael takes client list and heads out of office] where are you going?",dwight
26635,Just something I have to do first.,michael
26636,Where are you taking the client list?,dwight
26637,"Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone [starts running, Dwight follows]",michael
26638,"Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don't do this. No. [chasing Michael out of the office into parking lot]",dwight
26639,Oh shoot! [gets to his car turns around],michael
26640,"Freeze, give me the list! [still chasing him back into office where Michael grabs his car keys from his desk and heads back to parking lot]",dwight
26641,"No no no, I can't let you do this!",dwight
26642,Those people will be ruined. [runs out back door],michael
26643,"Its business, not personal. [they run back outside, where Dwight gets paper from Michael]",dwight
26644,"Give it, give it. We can't do this to those people.",michael
26645,"Its over, Michael, its over. [holding list of clients up]",dwight
26646,Im not a shark.,michael
26647,"Okay, it is time for the final votes. All of those in favor of resolution Hillary Swank is hot? [half of office raises hand] Okay. And all those opposed? [he skips back and joins other half of office in raising hand]",andy
26651,[pained] Mpfh.,michael
26653,Thank you.,michael
26655,"Okay, bye bye.",michael
26656,"Guess whose stock just went up, golden boy?",dwight
26657,I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That's what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even... what's the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping?,michael
26658,"Oh, hey what is this?",michael
26659,Hillary swank.,pam
26660,"Oh, she is hot. ['Hillary Swank is hot' supporters cheer]",michael
26661,"Last week I gave a fire safety talk. [clears throat] And nobody paid any attention.  It's my own fault for using PowerPoint.  PowerPoint is boring.  People learn in a lot of different ways, but experience is the best teacher.  [lights a cigarette] Today, smoking is gonna save lives. [throws cigarette into garbage can filled with paper and lighter fluid]",dwight
26662,[looking around office to see if anyone notices the smoke]  Does anyone smell anything smoky?,dwight
26664,[clears throat],dwight
26665,"[points to smoke] Oh, my God! Uh, Oh my God!",pam
26667,"Whoa, fire!",andy
26668,"Oh, fire!  Oh my goodness!  What's the procedure?  What do we do, people?",dwight
26669,The phones are dead.,pam
26670,"Oh, how did that happen?",dwight
26672,"No, we don't know that.  The smoke could be coming through an air duct.",dwight
26673,"Oh my God! Okay, it happening.  Everybody stay calm.",michael
26674,"What's the procedure, everyone? What's the procedure?",dwight
26675,Stay [bleep] calm!,michael
26676,"Wait, wait, wait.",dwight
26677,"Everyone, now [bleep] calm down!",michael
26678,"No! No, Michael! No!  Touch the handle.  If it's hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.",dwight
26679,What does warm mean?,michael
26681,Not a viable option.,dwight
26682,Try a different door.,pam
26683,"Okay, what's next?",dwight
26684,Don't run.,michael
26685,Oh! Here's a door.  Check that one out. How's the handle?,dwight
26686,It-- it's warm.,andy
26687,"Well, uh, another option. [everyone chattering at once]",dwight
26688,Back door.,jim
26689,Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone.  No bunching!,dwight
26692,"Get out of the way! Go, go, go!",michael
26693,"Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can...",dwight
26695,Aah! This ones hot too!,andy
26696,"Okay, we're trapped.  Everyone for himself.",michael
26697,"Okay, let's go.",dwight
26699,"Calm, please",dwight
26700,Get out of the way!,andy
26701,Have you ever seen a burn victim?,dwight
26702,Move it!,andy
26703,"Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options.  Where do we go folks?  Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth?",dwight
26705,"A what?  A rag.  A damp rag, perhaps.  Let's remember those procedures.  What are the options?  Okay, that's the wrong way.  We've already tried that.  Remember your exit points.  Exit points people.",dwight
26707,What's next?,dwight
26713,"How about 911?  Anyone? 911. [Michael throws a chair at the window, Kevin smashes a chair through the vending machine and begins to grab snacks, everyone is shouting.]",dwight
26714,What do we do?,pam
26715,Use the surge of fear and adrenaline to sharpen your decision-making.,dwight
26716,"Okay, I am not dying here.  Come on. [everyone is coughing from the smoke, Dwight lights some fire crackers and they start popping]",jim
26718,The fire's shooting at us!,andy
26720,"Yes! [Dwight pulls fire alarm] Yes, ba-- Yes, battering ram! Battering ram!",andy
26722,"Go, go, go, go, go!! [Andy and Jim ram the door with the copy machine]",andy
26723,[throws the projector out the window] Help!! Help!!,michael
26725,[blowing air horn] Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin!  This has been a test of our emergency preparedness.  There is no fire.  It was only a simulation.,dwight
26726,What?!,jim
26727,"Fire not real.  This was merely a training exercise. [Oscar drops down from the ceiling] So, what have we learned? [Stanley falls to the floor]  Oh come on.  It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack.",dwight
26728,"No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die!  Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president!  You are black, Stanley! I'm gonna give him mouth to mouth.",michael
26729,"No, no, no! Don't give him mouth to mouth for this!",jim
26730,He's going to swallow is tongue.,michael
26731,No. Michael. Michael.,jim
26732,Open your mouth.  Come on. Don't swallow it.,michael
26733,[everyone shouting at once] Michael! Michael!,jim
26734,Leave me al--,michael
26735,You're choking him!,andy
26736,Saving him!,michael
26738,A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.,dwight
26739,Electricity.,michael
26740,Shampoo.,dwight
26742,"I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone.  Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days.",dwight
26744,"Yes I shouted 'fire!'.  I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--",dwight
26745,Hed. Hedded,michael
26746,When no one hedded--,dwight
26747,Take hedded of.,michael
26748,N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.,dwight
26749,Heed. Heed.,michael
26750,"So, you--",dwight
26751,Take heed of.,michael
26752,"And, well, I don't see my co-workers--",dwight
26753,Take heed of.,michael
26754,Hee-heeding this right now.,dwight
26756,"Okay. [walks to the window, sighs] This city.  Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed.",michael
26758,Yes. We are. We are livid.  But we are going to let this one slide.,michael
26760,"I am not a mind reader, David.",michael
26762,"Can you shove down?  Instead... shove down, please.  Instead, what I think we should do is strip of your title as safety officer.",michael
26763,No.,dwight
26764,And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice.  Something that Dwight doesn't like.,michael
26765,PETA.,dwight
26767,Do you?,michael
26769,You talking to me?,michael
26771,What?,michael
26772,Well... I guess we papered over that pretty nicely. [chuckles] It always amuses me when corporate thinks they can make some big change with a twenty minute meeting in some fancy high-rise. What's the matter? You hungry?,dwight
26773,"[sighs] No, Dwight.  I am worried.  A man's life is in my hands.",michael
26774,Don't you worry about that.  I got it covered.  Okay?,dwight
26775,Yeah.,michael
26776,I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping.,dwight
26777,That's not gonna happen. I'm taking over as safety man.,michael
26778,What? You?,dwight
26779,Yes.,michael
26780,Come on.,dwight
26781,I'm a smart guy.  I'll figure it out.,michael
26782,That's preposterous.,dwight
26783,"No, I will.",michael
26784,"Nobody should have to go to work thinking, 'Oh, this is the place that I might die today.'  That's what a hospital is for. An office is for not dying.  An office is a place to live life to the fullest, to the max, to... An office is a place where dreams come true.",michael
26785,"Shhh! Don't excite him. Don't make him excitable. [whispering] Welcome back, Stanley.",michael
26795,Andy.,michael
26796,[in a British accent] A throne for your highness.,andy
26798,"No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet.",michael
26801,"Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means 'always be closing.'",michael
26802,This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.,dwight
26803,Shut it.  Shut it.,michael
26804,"We found ourselves on the less prepared side of things when Stanley had his... when his heart went berserk. And I knew exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense I had no idea what to do.  So I thought we should have CPR training class and of course you can't get the practice dummy unless the instructor comes along with it. Red Cross, you know, racket.",michael
26809,Absolutely I would not.,dwight
26810,You know who I really think should go? Stanley.,michael
26813,Come on.,michael
26815,No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working.  What are you gonna do if you're by yourself and your heart stops?,michael
26817,And you're okay with that?,michael
26819,"Uh-uh.  No, no, no.  Come on. Get up.  Let's do this.",michael
26821,Come on Stanley.  You're losing you.  You're losing you. Do it!,michael
26823,This is you we're talking about.,michael
26825,"Okay, okay.  I'll show them. Here we go. [whispers] Stanley.  All right.",michael
26827,"No, Rose. They are not breathing.  And they have no arms or legs.",michael
26829,"Where are they?  You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?",michael
26831,"How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything.",michael
26833,"okay, that's uh, hard to keep track.  How many is that per hour?",michael
26834,How's that gonna help you?,jim
26835,I will divide and then count to it.,michael
26836,Right.,jim
26838,"Yes, yes I do.  I love that song. [clears throat, begins to sing] First I was afraid, I was petrified.",michael
26840,"Okay, I got it.",michael
26842,"Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive [Andy joins in] Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.",michael
26843,"Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah...",michael
26844,"Oh you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man, no time to talk. Music loud, women warm, been kicked around since I was born. Oh, it's alright, it's okay, [Michael and Kelly join in] you can look the other way. Loo do do!",andy
26846,"Da, da, da, da, da, da, da",andy
26850,"Okay, he's dead.  Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose?",dwight
26852,Anyone else?,dwight
26854,"Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card.  If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest.",dwight
26856,He is an organ donor.,michael
26857,He is.,dwight
26858,Yeah.,michael
26859,Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket. [pulls out knife from holder that is attached to his leg] Here we go.,dwight
26863,We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.,dwight
26865,"Hey, Stanley.",michael
26866,Stanley.,andy
26867,Are you okay?,michael
26871,Clarice?,dwight
26874,"I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic.",dwight
26876,Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?,michael
26877,Wow.,dwight
26878,"Okay, look. David, this is why we have training.  We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person.",michael
26879,"Hope you brought your appetitos.  My lady. My tuna. A little movie popcorn. [dumps popcorn in bowl, it's almost all seeds] Uh, damn it.  This movie, a lot of buzz.  Not coming out for another six months.  Mrs. Albert Hannaday. So, friendship with the Nard-dog has its privileges.",andy
26880,"We don't normally download films illegally.  Because we're honest,  hardworking people.",pam
26881,And we don't know how.,jim
26882,"But Andy does, so we have to watch it with him.",pam
26883,Punishment fits the crime.,jim
26890,[after Pam checks her cell phone] What's going on?,jim
26891,"Uh, no one really knows, but Pam's parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.",jim
26892,My dad spent the night at our place last night.  My parents have been fighting for weeks and... it kinda sucks.  Jim's been great. But I'm gonna need to buy my dad a robe.,pam
26893,He's not saying what he needs to say.,pam
26894,Hmm? Who? Sam?,andy
26895,Yeah.,pam
26896,"I mean, they just need to communicate, you know?  If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then--",jim
26897,Hmm.,andy
26898,"Jim and Pam are, like, movie geniuses. They're catching things that are totally going over my head.",andy
26899,"Hi, everyone.  Corporate has given Dwight two strikes. They are very, very upset with him. So, as a disciplinary measure he is going to have to issue a formal apology. Dwight, have you prepared your statement of regret?",michael
26900,I have.,dwight
26901,Let's hear it.,michael
26902,[clears throat] 'I state my regret.',dwight
26903,You couldn't of memorized that?,jim
26904,"I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it.  Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal.",dwight
26906,"Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay?  Make a line. Just form a line right here.  Sign it!  Sign it now!",dwight
26907,"Hi dad. Yeah Jim has shaving cream, check our bathroom.",pam
26911,Gimme a break.,jim
26912,"I know it man. You know, Lilly was supposed to be Nicole Kidman, um and it was gonna be Sophie's mom, not grandmother. But then Nicole kidman dropped out so they went with Lily, with a small rewrite.",andy
26916,[to Pam] Can you believe this? [pause] He was pretty talkative at breakfast.,jim
26917,"Yeah... but... eh... breakfast? You mean when they were eating soup? I don't think that was breakfast. Unless soup, does soup symbolize breakfast?",andy
26918,So he doesn't share it with his daughter but he shares it with his daughter's fiance?,pam
26919,"You guys, they're making out.",andy
26920,Hey.,pam
26921,Hey.,jim
26922,"Um, did my dad say anything about my mom?",pam
26923,"Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal.",jim
26924,[sighs],pam
26925,What?,jim
26926,"I dunno. I mean, maybe he'll talk to you about some of this stuff 'cause he can't really talk to me about it.",pam
26927,Mmm...,jim
26928,You're good to talk to.,pam
26929,"[laughs] I'm ok, I'm not, great, and um... [nods]",jim
26930,[in a monk-impression tone] Ohmmm... Ohmmm... Everybody sit on the floor Indian style like me. [Meredtih sits Indian style in a dress exposing herself right in front of Michael] Ohmmm my God if you're wearing a dress please keep your knees together nobody wants to see that ohmmm... ohmmm...,michael
26931,My goal is to make this office as peaceful a place for Stanley Hudson as I can. I think sounds have a lot to do with that. Here are some downloaded peaceful sounds. [a couple of sounds play on the computer] That one makes me think... of death. It's kinda nice...,michael
26932,"[everyone is lying on the floor in the conference room with the light off, Michael is walking around with a candle in his hand] It is a beautiful, sunny day as we walk through the meadow that is very spiritual and relaxing and there are flowers and it is sunny and beautiful. Now, up ahead, a castle, in a distance.",michael
26933,Don't open your eyes.,jim
26934,"What? [opens her eyes, Michael is standing over her] Oh...",pam
26935,"And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out.",michael
26937,Too expensive.,michael
26939,"Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want? [beeping starts] What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones.",michael
26941,"Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game?",michael
26943,You have stress?,michael
26945,During our relaxation exercise?,michael
26947,"No no, I'll help you. I'll help you up. Here we go.",michael
26949,Let me getcha.,michael
26951,"Ok, alright.",michael
26953,Ok. [beeping slows down],michael
26955,"Ok... I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh... Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? That's what HE said! Right guys, 'cause of gay? [Oscar has Stanley's monitor now] Let's give this a shot.",michael
26956,Hellloo... [beeping speeds up as Michael gets closer],michael
26958,So... it wasn't Dwight after all. Looks like I am the killer. You never expect that you're the killer... it's uh... great twist. Great twist.,michael
26959,"Dunder Mifflin this is Pam. Oh, hey Mom. No, what did Dad say?",pam
26960,What did you say to my dad?,pam
26961,What?,jim
26962,"After you talked, he called my mom and said he was gonna look for an apartment.",pam
26963,"Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again. [Pam rolls her eyes and walks away]",jim
26964,"Fifty percent of marriages end in divorce, so... it was her parents or my parents...",jim
26965,What could Jim have said to make my dad want to leave my mom? And at what point in our marriage is he gonna say it to me?,pam
26966,I don't get it. Do I stress you out?,michael
26967,Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.,dwight
26968,Oh...,michael
26969,Speaking of which... [hands Michael the paper to sign for Dwight's formal apology],dwight
26970,"Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. It's what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge.",michael
26971,"Ok everybody, I've figured it out. The reason that you are all so stressed around me is that you are too intimidated to tell me what you really think. [Jim shakes his head at the camera] You are keeping these feelings inside, and that is what's causing stress. So, what is the solution? Solution is honesty, laughter, and comedy. In short...",michael
26973,"What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh c'mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You've seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody's laughing, and everybody's hugging each other...",michael
26975,Si senor.,michael
26977,"It's not! It's not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Don't hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that I'm so fit, or I'm a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I don't want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good.",michael
26980,I can already feel people's stress starting to melt. I think they're very excited about paying their respects this way. I have got to make sure that YouTube comes down to tape this.,michael
26981,"May I have your attention please? Sign in, sign in on the sign in sheet, the clipboard. This meeting is mandatory, if you do not sign in your name will not be counted. Thank you.",dwight
26983,That was the last signature I needed.,dwight
26984,"Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If you're here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left. [Creed looks around] So, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best shot. I am going to sit right here on my chair and... ah... whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may. [Angela jumps up] Ok... lower the mic for the midget.",michael
26989,"Hey Hey, I don't go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha!",michael
26991,You're so lucky! Good one... [clapping],michael
26993,Well...,michael
26995,"Pow pow pow... [hands making gunshot impression, sporadic clapping]",michael
26997,"[Toby tries to come on stage] NO! No, friends only. Friends ONLY. [Toby shrugs and sits back down]",michael
26998,"Several times a day, Michael says words that are way beyond my vocabulary.",jim
26999,I know where this is goin'.,michael
27000,Do ya?,jim
27001,No...,michael
27002,Ok. Remember Spider face?,jim
27003,No.,michael
27004,"OK. 'Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.",jim
27005,Spite her - ok [laughter],michael
27006,Yeah... yep.,jim
27007,How dare you all attack him like this.,dwight
27008,"Oh, stop it Dwight.",michael
27009,Michael is your superior.,dwight
27010,No no no no no no!,michael
27011,"Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.",dwight
27012,Dwight your'e supposed to do it this way.,michael
27013,"Ok, no, they don't understand who they have...",dwight
27014,"That is the way you're supposed to do it, idiot.",michael
27015,You're interrupting me. I'm trying to get your back.,dwight
27016,Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot.,michael
27017,Are you calling me an idiot?,dwight
27018,Idiot.,michael
27019,"Don't you ever talk to me that way. You pathetic, short little man. You don't have any friends, or any family, or any land. [clapping and whooing]",dwight
27020,"Well I just want to take a minute to talk to you all about something very serious. Once every hour, someone is involved in an internet scam. That man is Michael Scott. [laughter] He's supporting about 20 Nigerian princesses.",pam
27021,"Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?",michael
27022,"Well, ya know, Michael is a great delegator. He never does any work himself. Ever. And one time, I walked in on him naked, and his thing is so small. [quickly walks off stage] If it were an iPod it would be a shuffle! [clapping, laughter]",pam
27023,"Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.",michael
27025,"We are, we are a family.",michael
27027,Oh very funny.,michael

And now, a man that deserves no introduction, Michael Scott.",andy
27037,"Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there. [clears throat] Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isn't tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight. [clears throat again] So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought [choking up, clears throat again] sorry. [laughs nervously] I think I have a frog in my throat. Um... [sigh] I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up Phyllis and Kevin. Uh um... [Michael walks off stage, knocking over the snare drum]",michael

27039,"It's very unusual for Michael not to show up to work. My guess? He's either deeply depressed, or an icicle has snapped off his roof and impaled his brain. He has this terrible habit of standing directly underneath them and staring up at them. And I always say Michael, take two steps back, and stare at the icicle from the side. And he's like no, I like the way they look from standing directly underneath them.",dwight

27061,So what did he say? Was it my fault?,jim
27062,"Yeah. He said that you told him how much you love me. About how you feel when I walk in a room, and about how, you've never doubted for a second that I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with. I guess he's never felt that with my mom, even at their best.",pam
27063,You ok?,jim
27064,Yeah. [they hug],pam
27065,"When you're a kid you assume your parents are soul mates. My kids are gonna be right about that. I guess it also means that sometimes love affairs look different to the people inside them. [Andy is in the background, looks incredulous]",pam

Apparently Scranton has the best sales of any regional branch. So David Wallace has asked me to go to all the branches, except Nashua, still a little bit raw there. Um, but I am going to these branches and sharing my secret recipe for success. My 11 business herbs and spices, in a sales batter. [looks at Pam] Oh that, well, that is Pam.

Here a woof, there a woof. Everywhere a woof, woof. Um, you get it.",michael
27202,"I don't know you. But I need to know you in order to sell to you. That is why I have asked you to go around and tell me you names. I have an amazing mnemonic device, by which I have memorized all of your names. Shirty, mole, lazy eye, Mexico, baldy, sugar boobs, black woman. I have taken a unique part of who you are, and I have used that to memorize your name. Baldy, your head is bald. It is hairless. It is shiny, it is reflective like a mirror. 'M' your name is Mark.",michael
27204,Got it. It works.,michael
27206,But it works. I would like you all to give this a shot. What do you say?,michael

27402,And then she'll move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die.,michael
27403,"Yeah, maybe.",pam
27404,[laughs],michael
27405,Maybe. One step at a time.,pam
27406,[sighs],michael
27407,You can do this.,pam
27408,I can do this.,michael
27425,"Okay, so all we need is a theme... and cups, and ice, and punch, and a cake.",jim
27426,Busy!,dwight
27427,"Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about?",jim

27429,You know what? I could use a little help.,jim
27430,You know what? I'm a little busy.,dwight
27431,"We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign?",jim
27432,It's not effeminate. It's festive.,dwight
27433,"You've been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party's now at 3!",jim
27435,"Goooood morning, Viet-Nashua! Sales. Sales is what bwings us together, today. How do we deal with clients who say, 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn... about paper' and get them to 'Show us the money!' Well, we are going to find out today. Show of hands. How many of you are salesmen? Let's see the salesmen. [some raise their hands] Oh, okay. Well I know what the rest of you are thinking. Wow, yuck. Salesmen are the worst! They are awful. They are so arrogant. They think the whole place revolves around them. Handsome, good listeners, funny, Mr. Wonderful. So, okay, you're a salesman. What's, uh, what's your name?",michael
27437,A.J. What kind of name is A.J.?,michael
27439,What do you race cars?,michael
27441,"Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. You're funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A.J., are you dating? Is there somebody you date?",michael
27444,"Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so you're dating somebody? Um... is it serious?",michael
27446,Huh- [pauses] Does she ever talk about me? [voice cracking],michael
27447,"Oh, God.",pam
27450,It's all connected. Shut up. [to A.J.] Does she ever mention 'Michael Scott?',michael
27452,[sighs loudly] Does it feel good?,michael
27454,"[grunts] Your life. [sits down, upset] Oh, wow. Whew. Ahh, legs are sorta giving out. Long drive in the car, so let's just- We'll just continue. [sighs, falls to floor, gets more upset] Oh, wow. [takes deep breath] Ooh, okay.",michael
27455,"Michael, get off the floor!",pam
27456,"Yeah, yeah... uh, I can't do this Pam. Just read from- just read the cards.",michael
27457,"[whispering] No, no, no, you have to do it-",pam
27458,"No, no, I'm okay. I'm all right. [sighs heavily] Okay... okay.",michael
27459,"That was weird, huh? It's all part of the presentation. It was confusing, right? Because confusing situations happen to us all the time in our jobs. [pauses] I'm just trying to bridge the gap between what just happened and the fact that I'm going to be doing the rest of the presentation.  [reading from the cards, in Forrest Gump voice] Sales is like a box a chocolates, you never know which vendor you're gonna get. Forrest Gump.",pam
27460,"[pointing to staff members] Blazer. Freckles. Penguin. K.D. Lang. Holly's boyfriend. These mnemonic devices help to make a connection, and then, also to help you memorize names. I have a chainsaw! [holds up chainsaw, makes a wimpy chain saw noise] Cutting down the competition.",pam

27476,No.,pam
27477,I went through Holly's things.,michael
27478,What?,pam
27479,I stole a sleeve of her sweater.,michael
27480,"Oh, Michael...",pam
27481,I also stole something off of her computer. A document called 'Dear Michael.',michael
27482,You did what?,pam
27483,I shouldn't have done it. It just- I couldn't help it.,michael
27484,She never sent it to you?,pam
27485,"No, sh- she didn't. I'm gonna read it.",michael
27486,No.,pam
27487,Yes.,michael
27488,"No, under no circumstances can you read that letter. It's a violation of her trust.",pam
27489,How?,michael
27490,"Because, she didn't send it to you!",pam
27491,"I know, I know. You're right, you're right.",michael

27501,It's in the name.,dwight
27502,"[grunts] Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.",jim
27503,"You're right, forget horse hunting. It's stupid.",dwight
27504,"Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?",jim
27505,"Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord. [pretends to bite]",dwight
27506,"Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one.",jim
27507,"Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year. [rolls eyes] What about you?",dwight
27508,"Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.",jim
27509,"That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed.",dwight
27510,[to camera] Didn't see that one coming.,jim
27511,[closes laptop] It's deleted.,pam
27512,Well?,michael
27513,She still has feelings for you.,pam
27514,She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say?,michael
27515,"I can't tell you specifically, but... it's not over.",pam
27516,You're sure?,michael
27517,[nods and smiles],pam
27518,"[smiles, sighs, chuckles] Okay.",michael
27522,"Hey, it's not a surprise.",dwight
27523,Not a surprise.,jim
27525,"What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?",jim
27527,Told you.,dwight
27528,"You haven't heard our theme, though.",jim
27530,"That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.",jim
27531,"Our theme, if you will.",dwight
27532,"Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.",jim
27533,That's our theme.,dwight
27535,Yeah?,jim
27537,"[high-fives Jim] Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor?",dwight
27539,No.,dwight

27559,I feel great. So good to have closure. Ah! We should go apologize to Roy or something.,michael
27560,"No, we don't need to do that.",pam
27561,"Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him!",michael
27562,You mean Tony?,pam
27563,"Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony!",michael
27564,"Oh, Michael.",pam
27565,"Man, was he fat. So, so... fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty.",michael
27569,"Good morning, can I help you?",pam
27571,"I'm sorry, he's not in right now.",pam
27573,Shoot.,pam
27574,"They have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a salesman, or someone presses star and they go to accounting, basically 95% of my job.  But I'd like to see a machine that puts out candy for everyone. [realizing] Vending machine.",pam

27597,That was funny.  Let's go do it to somebody else.   Ayyyy!,michael
27598,"Oh, look at that.  Cupids and hearts. Really shoving our faces in it this year.  You doin OK, bud?",michael

27607,"Oh, wow look at those.  How nice for you.  Up there, front and center, beautiful.  I think they would look better right here.  [Michael takes the flowers from Pam's desk and puts them on the ground off to the side]  They're very pretty and I wouldn't want them to fall.  [Kevin groans]",michael
27608,"Just about everyone in this office is single right now.   Including me.  And everyone is experiencing an incredible amount of emotional pain.  Especially me, because of my great capacity for emotion, and it is my first Valentine's Day since Holly, so I think that I am well qualified to understand that these people need to be protected from having love shoved into their faces.",michael
27609,"Pam, really, they're back?",michael
27610,I can't see them when they're on the floor,pam
27611,"They're for her to look at, Michael.",jim
27612,"Can I have a word with you, Jim?",michael
27613,"Yes, let's have a word.",jim
27614,"Yes, um, Jim.  Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office.",michael
27615,"Oh, I'm sorry.",jim
27616,"Yeah.  And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it's creating a bit of a hostile work environment.",michael
27617,I understand that.,jim
27618,So sexy it becomes hostile.,dwight
27619,Mm-hmm.,michael
27620,"Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.",jim
27621,"Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest--",michael
27622,We do.,jim
27623,--that none of us can be a part of--,michael
27624,"You can't be a part of our relationship, Michael.",pam

27630,Having trouble finding a vein?,dwight
27632,How about now? [Dwight untenses his arm],dwight
27633,"I train my major blood vessels to retract into my body on command.  Also, I can retract my penis up into itself. [pauses, then nods signaling that he performed the feat]",dwight

27654,Type O-Ocean Spray.,michael
27657,What do you think?,pam
27658,I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.  Those mines aren't gonna sweep themselves.,jim
27659,We're in.,pam
27660,Yick.,michael
27662,I looked at the bag.,michael
27664,I looked straight at the bag.,michael
27666,"Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that don't have blood in them?",michael
27668,That was mean.,michael
27670,A hat.,michael
27672,That is full of soup.,michael
27674,What?,michael
27676,"Oh, already.",michael
27678,"Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I don't think I ate for three days. [Michael passes out]",michael

27682,"Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?",michael

27691,Anything to get out of that office.,pam
27695,"Oh yeah, I understood.",jim
27696,"Well here we all are.  Alone but together.  No flowers for us. [in a Mexican accent] Relationships, we don't need no stinking relationships.   I think we should all go around and tell our worst relationship story, and then get past it, just blow through it, yeah? Kelly, what about Ryan?  He treated you pretty terribly, yeah?",michael
27698,"Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex. [Kelly looks hurt]  Okay, sorry, let's, who else?  Oscar.",michael
27700,"Come on, I'm sure there's something you need to get off your chest.",michael
27702,"If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure?  I'm sure whatever you did it wasn't your fault.  OK well, who else?",michael
27704,"No way, a 280?",jim
27705,"Wow,  that's impressive.",pam
27707,Yikes.,jim
27709,"No.  Bob, no. No!",jim
27710,What?,pam
27713,Jim uses a 6 pound ball.,pam
27714,"That is a lie, that is a lie.",jim
27715,"Yes, he bowled 5 frames with this pink sparkly thing until a little girl had to ask for her ball back.",pam
27716,But! That girl must've had monstrous hands because the holes fit.,jim
27717,"No, you just have little dainty fingers.",pam
27719,"Nobody asked, Bob!",jim
27724,"Moron, if he was there wouldn't be a story.",michael
27726,Really sad.,michael

27736,Alright who's next?  Where's Andy?,michael
27738,What?,michael
27741,You know what guys? I don't think we need to do this.,michael
27742,"You're right.  OK everyone,  back to work.",dwight
27743,"No, no, no, no.  I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine's, and I think that there are other single people out there too.  We just need to find them.  There's a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park.  There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.",michael
27744,A net? a giant net?,dwight
27745,No.  Not a giant net.,michael
27746,What do you have in mind?,dwight
27747,I was thinking maybe like a mixer.,michael
27748,"Oh God, that's a terrible idea.",dwight
27749,Old fashioned meet market --,michael
27750,No.,dwight
27751,-- I don't think it is.,michael
27752,"Lonely people mixing with one another?  Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation?  Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work.  Pssh.  You're like the guy who invented the seat belt.",dwight
27753,"These people need love and I am going to get it for them  Who cares if we sell a little bit less paper today?  A great boss cares more about the happiness of his employees then anything else.  I am going to be cupid, and I am going to shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims, and they are going to get hit and say 'I'm in love I was hit by cupid's sparrow.'  Funny little bird, but he gets the job done.",michael
27754,Hey.,michael
27755,Hey.  No movement.,dwight
27756,"Ah, still early.",michael
27757,"Eh, its not that early.",dwight

27759,I'm ok.  Feel a little lopsided because of all the blood they took out of my right side.,dwight
27760,"No.  No, I meant about being single today.",michael
27761,Oh.  Meh.,dwight
27762,"Meh, exactly.  Eh.",michael
27763,Eh.,dwight
27764,"Oh, here we go.",michael
27765,Hello.,dwight
27766,"Hello. [two women, a blonde and a redhead, enter the office.  Michael and Dwight walk towards them and Dwight extends his hand to the redhead]",michael
27767,"Dwight K. Schrute. Why don't you introduce me to your little friend? [Dwight immediately breaks the handshake with the redhead and turns to the blonde]  Hi, Dwight.",dwight
27768,"Babe alert! [to the redhead]  Hello, I'm Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig.",michael
27770,"Lynn, follow me, come on in.  For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone.  Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.",michael
27773,"[after a short pause] So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev.  [after another pause] Where you from?",michael
27775,"Yeah, OK.  Well, he only gets better.",michael
27777,"I can untie any knot.  I'm serious.  Name a knot, any knot.  Go ahead.",dwight
27779,"You shouldn't believe everything you hear.  In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie.  So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.",dwight
27781,You must use a lot of paper.,dwight
27783,What's the rule about eating when people are in the bathroom?,pam
27784,I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat.,jim
27785,"Oh, damn. [Pam looks down at her salad] They've been in there for like ten minutes.",pam
27786,Look at that.  Bob ordered hot food.,jim
27787,Yes.  And I think they gave him too many fries.,pam
27788,"We should help him out. [Jim and Pam each take a French fry, eat it, and then look toward the bathroom]",jim
27793,"So, Eric.  You mentioned before that you are in tool and dye repair.",michael
27795,"Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so that's sort of a repair.  Alright, I'll let you guys talk.",michael
27796,"It's going very well.  People are mixing, a lot of hope.  Cause that's what you hate to see, when hope gets crushed. [Michael suddenly turns to look at the open entrance door] Sorry, thought I heard somebody coming in.  Um, so [looking at his watch] it's not too late.",michael
27797,"...and the kind of discounts we're talking about are not... hold on - Michael, Why do you keep looking at the front door?",dwight
27798,No reason.,michael
27799,Is somebody after you?,dwight
27801,"Hey, it just takes one!",dwight
27802,"Nobody's after me, I just, I met a woman when I was giving blood and I thought she might come by.",michael
27804,"It's not a big deal really, I just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, I picked up her glove so I was hoping I could give it back to her.",michael
27807,"Oh, not likely.  3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up.",dwight
27810,"Believe me its nothing.  I hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, I think our blood bags touched.",michael
27812,Here they come.,jim
27813,[looking up from her pilfering of Bob's food] What?,pam
27814,"No, just kidding.  Seriously though, that's enough.",jim
27815,"Well, you should cover it with the broccoli.",pam
27816,"Oh great, I have to cover?",jim
27817,Do you think they dined and dashed?,pam
27818,"Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.",jim
27819,I thought we were having a nice time.,pam
27820,We were.,jim
27821,Yeah.,pam
27822,[emerging from the Men's room] Empty.,jim
27823,[exiting the Ladies' room] Mine too. [Pam and Jim notice the Handicapped stall and walk towards it.  Putting their ears to the door they hear Mr. and Mrs. Vance being intimate],pam
27824,Oh boy.,jim
27825,My God.,pam
27826,OK.,jim
27828,Nah. [everyone groans and Girl turns around and walks away.,michael
27830,So...,jim
27833,"Yep, that, yeah.",pam
27835,Oh initially I did.,jim
27847,"So basically, the greater volume you decide to buy in, the greater discount we can give you.",dwight
27849,"OK, what's up?",dwight
27851,"Oh-oh-oh before you go, I'd just love to get a firm commitment on this.  You know maybe sign--",dwight

27860,"You know what, you guys, you guys can get out I'm gonna soldier on a little bit.",michael
27862,[after some encouragement] OK.,michael
27863,"Four months ago, I dated a woman named Holly and, um, this is actually the first time that I've even considered getting back into that arena again.  You know what, sometimes it's not about whether Cinderella gets her slipper back, but it's about the fact that the prince even picked up the slipper at all.   There's a lot of princesses out there.  You know, they have all different sizes and shapes of feet and hands so I think, I think my odds are pretty good.",michael
27868,"[on the phone] Yeah, that's no problem.",pam
27869,Pam?,michael
27870,[on the phone] Sure. Uh huh.,pam
27871,"Pam? Knock, knock.",michael

27878,[sighs] Who's there?,pam
27879,Buddha.,michael
27880,Buddha who?,pam
27881,"[puts a slice of bread and stick of butter on Pam's desk] Buddha this bread for me, won't you? [Michael and Dwight laugh]",michael
27882,Great.,pam
27883,"I, I need something to wipe my hand.",michael
27884,"Now there's, there's butter on my desk.",pam
27885,That was helping. It was classic.,michael
27886,I got a knock-knock joke.,dwight

27894,[in Russian accent] We will ask the questions!,dwight
27895,What the hell was that? [Michael starts to fight with Dwight],michael
27896,What are you doing?,dwight
27897,What are you doing?,michael
27898,Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it!,dwight
27899,"You, you like that?",michael
27900,C'mon. What are you doing? Mine was a part of my hilarious joke.,dwight
27901,Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. That's it.,michael
27902,Ding Dong.,jim

27904,KGB.,jim
27905,"Dwight, get the door.",michael
27906,I'm not answering it.,dwight
27907,Answer the door.,michael
27908,Ding dong.,jim
27909,"No way, it's the KGB.",dwight
27910,Ding dong.,jim
27911,I'm not answering that. You answer it.,dwight
27912,I'm not gonna answer it,michael
27913,"I'm not gonna answer it, it's the KGB. [Jim slaps Dwight]",dwight
27914,The KGB will wait for no one! [Michael laughs],jim
27915,It's true.,dwight
27916,"[Michael walks in dressed as Willy Wonka] Good morning, Michael.",pam
27917,"Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa.",michael
27918,"Good morning, Mr. Wonka, here are your messages.",pam
27919,"Why thank you very much. [notices jelly beans] Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!",michael
27920,Jelly beans.,pam
27921,"No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!",michael
27922,"The Willy Wonka Golden Ticket promotional idea is probably the best idea I have ever had. It's probably the best idea anybody has ever had. Three days ago, I slipped five pieces of gold paper into random paper shipments. This entitles the customer to ten percent off of their total order. It will be a day for them that is full of whimsy, and full of excitement and full of fantasy.",michael
27923,"I've written these things because it is my responsibility, as manager of this branch, to profiligate great ideas and I think I have done my part with the golden ticket promotion. Now it is your turn. I want to hear some great ideas from you that are just as good as mine. [Jim raises hand] Umm hmm.",michael
27924,We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --,jim
27925,Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.',michael
27926,Free paper.',jim
27927,No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.,michael
27928,"Golden Girls. That's a golden ticket idea, right, I mean how great was that show? Golden Grahams. Another, is it -- I don't get this...",andy
27929,"No, you don't. No, it - [sighs] What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?",michael
27931,No! No! No!,andy
27933,"[sighs] You're making it too easy for her. You're just conveying, 'Oh I like you just the way you are.'",andy
27935,Well that's not what we agreed on.,andy
27936,What are you doing?,jim
27937,Huh?,andy
27938,"[to Kevin] Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know.",jim
27939,No.,andy
27940,"You don't have to wait that long. I mean, you don't have to wait a month to ask her out. Just ask her out.",pam
27941,You're asking him to give up all of his power.,andy
27942,What power?,jim
27944,"You can't let a girl feel good about herself. It will backfire on you. Every compliment has to be backhanded. 'Oh I like your dress, but I'd like it more if you had prettier hair.'",andy
27945,That's psychotic. Do guys actually do that?,pam
27946,Well guys with girlfriends don't.,jim
27947,"That's low, Tuna.",andy
27948,"[on phone] Hey, Tom. What's that? Oh, you found a golden ticket. [puts hand on receiver and speaks to office] One of my clients found a golden ticket. [Michael screams in excitement] [Jim back on phone] Yup. No, congratulations. [Michael dances in background]",jim
27949,Woo hoo.,michael
27950,[on phone] I'll take that down right now.,jim
27951,Tell me; was it a spoiled little girl with big lips...,michael
27952,I'm on the phone.,jim
27953,...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?,michael
27954,[on phone] Hold on one second.,jim
27955,Invite them on the tour.,michael
27956,[to Michael] It's actually Blue Cross from Pennsylvania.,jim
27957,"Really? That's kind of a big client. [gets up and heads toward Oscar] Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?",michael
27959,Yeah?,michael
27961,Yeah.,michael
27963,"[on phone] Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't.",jim
27964,How do you not spread out the tickets into different shipments?,jim
27965,I thought I did. So...,michael
27966,OK...,jim
27967,Well no harm no foul.,michael
27968,...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.,jim
27969,"You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good.",michael
27970,Hey. Hey. Hey. You idiot.,michael
27972,Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?,michael
27974,Irrelevant.,michael
27976,"OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?",michael
27977,My golden ticket idea? OK. Why would anyone think that this is my golden ticket idea? There is a one in 13 chance that this could be anybody's golden ticket idea. [sighs] That... [sighs],michael
27978,"Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi ,David. [Michael shakes his head to Pam] No, I'm sorry he's not back from the Civil Rights rally. I'll have him call you the minute he gets back from the Lincoln Memorial.",pam
27979,"When Michael's skirting a phone call, he gave me a list of places to say he is. 'Stopping a fight in the parking lot. ' 'An Obama fashion show. ' Whatever... that is. Or 'trapped in an oil painting.' I'm gonna save that one.",pam
27980,"Nobody panic. The good news is... they can't fire all of us, right?",michael
27982,"No, they can't.",michael
27984,"Oscar, you don't know what the hell you are talking about.",michael
27986,"Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so -",michael
27987,"So, well I lost a ton of money today and I have a mortgage, so I'm a little pissed too.",jim
27988,"Thank you, Jim is with me.",michael
27989,"Absolutely not, I'm mad at you.",jim
27990,Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.,michael
27992,"OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess. [Pam raises hand] Yes.",michael
27993,Does that mean an idea that blows up in our faces later? [Pam's phone rings],pam
27994,Good one.,jim
27995,"OK, don't get that. Please? [Pam gets up to answer her phone]",michael
27997,That is not constructive.,michael
27998,"[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Oh hi, David. He's having a colonoscopy. Alright, I'll find out if he's out yet.",pam
27999,"[on phone] Hello David. I just got back from my procedure, so--",michael
28001,How are you doing?,michael
28003,[reading from computer] My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.,michael
28005,"Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don't... I don't know.",michael
28007,I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.,michael
28009,You're breaking up.,michael
28011,"OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant.",michael
28013,Yes.,michael
28015,No.,michael
28017,[long pause] Yes.,michael
28018,"[Dwight walks in] Come on in. Good to see ya, have a seat. I just wanted to congratulate you on that great golden ticket idea.",michael
28019,That was your idea.,dwight
28020,"Woah, wow, who told you that?",michael
28021,You did. Several times. Over and over again.,dwight
28022,"[same time as Dwight] No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight.",michael
28023,[same time as Michael] You were dressed as Willy Wonka so...,dwight
28024,I'm not taking... I'm not taking...,michael
28025,Wasn't my idea. Loved - but I can't.,dwight
28026,"Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.",michael
28027,You don't keep a diary.,dwight
28028,Yes I do. You've just never seen it. [reading from diary] March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.,michael
28029,Hold that thought. [Dwight gets up and gets own diary from desk and returns] [flipping through diary] March... 4th. Michael Scott came up with golden ticket idea to give five customers ten perfect off for one year.,dwight
28030,Why do you have a diary?,michael
28031,To keep secrets from my computer.,dwight
28032,"OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.",michael
28033,Impossible.,dwight
28034,"Yes, you did.",michael
28035,"I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math.",dwight
28036,What are you writing? [Dwight writes in diary],michael
28037,Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies.,dwight
28038,Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?,michael
28039,With all my heart.,dwight
28041,"All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance.",jim
28043,I don't think Jim means to say that you shouldn't touch her.,pam
28044,"No, that is what I mean.",jim
28045,"[to Jim] Shush. [to Kevin] Kevin, a playful touch on the arm, or on the back, it can show your interest and it's really romantic.",pam
28047,"No, stop it.",jim
28048,Don't touch her. Don't talk to her. Don't look at her.,andy
28049,"[Jim, Andy and Pam all talking over each other] ...turn into this black and carbon brick-where this barbeque sauce of shame and rage and two hot people with a perfect relationship would not understand that.",andy
28050,We think a lot alike. Sometimes you will think something and I will say what you're thinking--,michael
28051,"OK, what am I thinking right now?",dwight
28052,"Umm, nacho chips.",michael
28053,No... How skin is the largest organ of the body.,dwight
28054,"Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.",michael
28055,"Oh, not gonna happen.",dwight
28056,I did fall on my sword once. I was running with it in my belt. Won't happen again.,dwight
28057,"Why do you even want to stay at Dunder Mifflin? I mean what's the point? You're cooped up in there all day. You don't get to do your farming. You're not dating Angela anymore. It doesn't matter if you get fired for taking credit for the gold ticket idea. It doesn't matter. Me on the other hand, I would be lost without this place. You, way too manly.",michael
28058,What about Shoe La La?,dwight
28059,[sighs] It's not ready yet.,michael
28060,"I have an idea for a fancy men's shoe store called Shoe La La. And it's just men's shoes for the special occasions in a man's life, like the day that you get married or the day your wife has a baby, or for just lounging around the house.",michael
28061,"May I have your attention please. I have an announcement. Mr. Dwight Schrute and I just returned from a wonderful stroll together and although I probably will never do it again, I had fun. I really had fun with my best friend, Dwight.",michael
28063,"Yes they are, you just don't care about the information.",michael
28064,I love working here and I do not want to leave.,dwight
28065,He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired.,michael
28066,Well...,dwight
28067,"I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion...",michael
28068,We discussed the fact that I'm cooped up here instead of experiencing the whole wide world.,dwight
28069,Right.,michael
28070,No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.,dwight
28071,That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom.,michael
28072,Try me.,dwight
28073,That's why you made the decision. That's why you made...,michael
28074,I haven't made a decision yet.,dwight
28075,You kind of have.,michael
28076,No.,dwight
28077,Yes.,michael
28078,You cannot take the fall for him.,jim
28079,He said he would do the same for me.,dwight
28080,He can do the same for you. Right now. By getting fired instead of you. So what are you gonna do?,jim
28081,I'm gonna go back to work. After I write you up for insubordination.,dwight
28082,There it is.,jim
28083,"[seeing David Wallace come into the office] Oh my God. Dwight! Dwight! Get in--- what's it gonna be, what are you gonna do? [Dwight runs into Michael's office] What's it gonna be? Are you gonna do this thing for me? Dwight? [David knocks on Michael's door and opens door] Hey David, how are you? Good to see you. Nice surprise. Dwight and I were just having a very unfortunate conversation.",michael
28085,"Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn't it?",michael
28087,David... you're welcome. [Dwight and David shake hands and make exclamations],dwight
28090,That's what she said! [David laughs],dwight
28091,"Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea?",michael
28092,Inspiration.,dwight
28093,Really? How did-- how are you inspired?  How did it pop into your head Dwight?,michael
28094,[same time as Michael] You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom.,dwight
28095,Give me the details of how that happened.,michael
28096,"You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years.",jim
28097,What?,michael
28098,And you know what? I even made fun of you when you dressed up as Willy Wonka to pitch this idea and for that I apologize.,jim
28099,Apology rejected.,dwight
28100,"[going up to give Dwight a hug] Thanks for much for helping the company, Dwight.",pam
28101,Oh Pam.,dwight
28103,Thanks old man.,dwight
28105,Yeah.,dwight
28107,Sure.,pam
28108,David? David?,michael
28109,[same time as Michael] 'Cause I've got this idea...,dwight
28110,David?,michael
28112,Could I be a part of the meeting also?,michael
28114,"Yeah, let's face it. This meeting sounds like it's Wonka fans only. He's never seen the movie. [David laughs]",jim
28115,Alright.,dwight
28117,"OK guys, listen up. Here's the deal. I love candy. Sweet sugary candy from the second it touches my tongue to the moment it's metabolized by my stomach acids, so naturally I liked Willy Wonka.",dwight
28120,So I love Willy Wonka. That golden ticket scene is so inspiring to me that that's where I cam up with that idea [Michael comes into conference room].,dwight
28121,There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.,michael
28122,It's actually based on a book called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.,pam
28123,Pam...,dwight
28124,I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.,michael
28125,That is my idea.,dwight
28127,"OK, here's what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it's a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that?",michael
28129,It is my idea.,dwight
28130,Oh how dare you.,michael
28131,It is my idea. I'm filled with good ideas. Thousands of good ideas.,dwight
28132,"You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?",michael
28133,Horse Boat.,dwight
28134,Oh please.,michael
28135,A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!,dwight
28136,Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge...,michael
28137,Oh give me a break.,dwight
28138,"...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas.",michael
28139,That's because they're easy!,dwight
28140,They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.,michael
28141,[same time as Michael] Women's urinals... uh...,dwight
28143,"Yes, it's Michael's idea that he forced on me on threat of death.",dwight
28144,Thank You!,michael
28146,"Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame.",michael
28148,OK.,pam
28150,When they look back on this day in the history books all that will be remembered is that I had a good idea. And that's what I am going to write down in my diary. That is what I want you to write down in yours.,michael
28151,Oh I am. In my own words.,dwight
28152,I want to see it.,michael
28153,No.,dwight
28154,I want to see it. [Michael gets up to try to see Dwight's diary],michael
28155,"No, Michael.",dwight
28156,Give me...  Give me the diary.,michael
28157,No! [Michael struggles to take Dwight's diary from his hand],dwight
28164,"Well, it's uh, his funeral. So... neh!",andy
28165,Ding dong.,dwight
28166,Who is it?,jim
28167,KGB.,dwight
28168,"Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second.",jim
28169,"[in accent] When you are done, open the door. ... Hello in there?",dwight
28170,"Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine.",jim
28171,We have more houses to visit.,dwight
28172,"If you want to come back then, that'll be fine.",jim
28173,We will come back at... how is [looks at watch] 4:45?,dwight
28174,I get back from work around 6.,jim
28175,How about 5:15?,dwight
28176,"You can try. That, that might work.",jim
28177,"Very well, we will come back at 5:15.",dwight
28178,Alright.,jim
28179,"Michael, since it is your fifteenth anniversary at the company, I thought it might be appropriate to begin the festivities with a fifteen-minute round of applause.",dwight
28180,I like it.,michael
28181,Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence.,dwight
28182,[wearing a tuxedo] I don't know. Is it classy enough?,jim
28183,"Jim! Enough with the classy, ok?",dwight
28184,"I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.",jim
28185,"I think you're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here.",michael
28186,"And of course, classy.",jim
28187,"And classy, yeah.",michael
28188,"Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?",dwight
28189,"Last week, Dwight sent out a memo about the dress code. So, this is me showing him that I'm taking it very seriously.",jim
28190,"Oh, here's one:  a string quartet, playing classy-cal music. [Jim grimaces]",dwight
28191,"[watches Jim grimace, copies him] You know, that's good but it's not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership.",michael
28192,That's it. Or Mr. Peanut.,jim
28193,Yes.,michael
28194,Mr. Peanut is not classy.,dwight
28195,He is.,michael
28196,"He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat.",dwight
28197,That's what makes him classy.,michael
28198,"Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.",dwight
28199,"Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind.",jim
28200,"Well, I'm sorry, I just don't know what classy is then.",dwight
28201,"Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my head:  an ice sculpture. Of you. Completely surrounded by a variety of chocolate-covered fruits.",jim
28202,Strawberries?,michael
28203,That's inspired.,jim
28204,"I said that! [storms out, slams door behind him]",dwight
28205,Not classy.,pam
28206,Not classy at all.,michael
28207,De class'.,jim
28208,French. Classy.,michael
28209,"Hi, can I help you?",pam
28211,Sure. Just one second. Please have a seat.,pam
28212,[on speakerphone] Yes?,michael
28213,"Michael, there's a Charles Miner here to see you.",pam
28214,Miner? I hardly know her!... Hello?,michael
28215,"Yeah, are you coming out now?",pam
28216,"Uh-huh. [comes out of office] Well, well, well, who have we here? Ah, it is Prince Charles Miner. [shakes Charles' hand] At your service. Everybody, this is Sir Charles Miner and he is the new VP for the Northeast region. So, just give it up for this big guy, right? Give it up. [leads round of applause] Here he is.",michael
28218,"Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? C'mon, here we go, don't be shy, don't be shy, you're one of us . [whispers] Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish.",michael
28219,Hey.,jim
28220,Yes.,michael
28221,Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.,jim
28222,"What? No, I didn't want to make everybody nervous.",michael
28223,"Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-",jim
28224,"You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish.",michael
28225,"Originally founded in 1866, Scranton quickly became one of Pennsylvania's largest anthracite coal-mining communities.",dwight

28227,"We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is...",dwight
28228,"Surprise! [unveils bagels sitting on table] As you can see, I turned the bagels from O's into C's, for Charles.",michael
28230,Took me all night.,michael
28231,This is what you did last night?,pam
28232,"I met this guy at corporate last week and we were just digging each other's vibe. I was totally grooving on him and vice-versa.

28239,"Oh, you'd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, there's probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh.",jim
28241,"Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it... [being pulled away by Pam]",jim
28242,He just had to wear his tux today.,pam

28312,Does David know this?,michael
28314,"Well that, actually, is an excellent segue into really what is my only point-",michael
28316,"And that- I-I don't need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, it's all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear?",michael

28320,Whatever David wants.,michael

28347,Nobody thanked me.,michael
28348,"Thanks, Charles.",jim

28355,Yep.,michael
28357,"Do some overtime? You want to do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes. You may.",michael

28382,Stop doing that!,andy

28385,What is that smaller stripper holding?,michael
28386,Cupcake. It's cupcakes and strippers all the way down.,pam
28387,Ok.,michael

28397,It's a great idea. And we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay.,michael

28401,"Whoa. You're talking about my anniversary party, so. . .",michael
28403,"Yeah, why don't you do that?",michael
28405,"Yeah, here we go. Ok.",michael
28407,What?,michael
28409,Newsflash:  I've been here for fifteen years. Headline:  You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story!,michael
28411,"Ok, no, no, no, no. No. You know what? I'm going to New York. And I am going to talk to David Wallace. [gets jacket] I'm going to tell him everything. And I'm sorry to say, you're screwed. And, you know what? You are gonna be through. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry to do that to you. Do you even know how paper is made? It's not like steel. You don't put it into a furnace. If you put paper into a furnace, you know what would happen? You'd ruin it. [pushes chair as he leaves]",michael
28413,Hey.,jim
28415,"Alright, Charles, I've gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, I'm a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker.  And a great number two for the office.",jim
28417,Second-in-command to Michael.,jim
28419,"Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me.",jim
28421,"Assistant regional manager, yeah.",jim
28423,"No, not exactly.",jim
28425,"Alright, I will, um, I'm just gonna let you get back to that.",jim

28430,[points to bathroom door] So is this the meeting you've been in all day?,michael
28432,I drove.,michael
28434,"Cancelled my fifteenth anniversary party. Just pulled the rug out from under me. And he said no figs. I've already bought em. And I don't have a place to store them. So, I feel like I've been sort of boned.",michael
28436,"Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?",michael
28438,"Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.",michael
28440,Clearly that's what you wanted.,michael
28442,Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot.,michael
28444,I've put having a family on hold.,michael
28446,And I've never gone hang-gliding.  And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington.,michael
28448,Cool.,andy
28449,Excellent.,dwight
28451,See ya. See ya. [Charles leaves] Bye!,jim
28452,"And for my next trick, I will make my career disappear.",jim
28462,"I don't understand that after fifteen years of service here, I have to get in the car and drive to New York in order to talk to you.  That doesn't seem right to me. That doesn't seem fair. And I think that I've earned more than that.",michael
28464,Ok.,michael
28466,[gets up to shake David's hand] I quit.,michael
28468,You have no idea how high I can fly.,michael
28469,"I'm telling you, when corporate sends somebody, it is big trouble, or, really good news. And then sometimes it means business as usual.",andy
28472,Why are you asking him? I just told you why he's here.,andy
28476,"I had no idea when I got in that car and headed to New York I was going to quit.  I got on that ramp and I thought two hours, two hours to go.  Feeling good.  Listen to some tunes.  Should've peed before I left.",michael
28478,"Okay, so.  I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken!  So I have to take the normal door.",michael
28480,"No, No! I was so nervous it was the wrong building! I walked into the wrong building!",michael
28482,He finally has a story everyone wants to hear... and he knows it.,pam
28483,"Okay focus. Focus.  You're in the right building, you're with the right people; what happened?",pam
28484,I looked at Wallace and I said 'I quit!' and as I turned to leave I looked back and I said 'You have no idea how high I can fly.',michael

28497,I have a job.,michael
28498,For four more days.,andy
28499,Do you have any leads on a job?,pam
28500,"Pam, what you don't understand is that at my level you just don't look in the want-ads for a job.  You are head-hunted.",michael
28501,You called any headhunters?,jim
28502,Any good headhunter knows I am available.,michael

28743,"[phone ringing] You gonna answer that, Kev?",jim
28745,Charles is having Kevin cover the phones for a while. How do I say this diplomatically? [pause] I think Kevin is doing exactly as well as anyone might have expected someone like him to perform in a position like that.,jim
28747,"No. [Andy gets up from his desk] Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier.",jim
28749,"It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.",jim

28767,"Oh, good. My hooker's here. [laughs] Hi.",michael
28768,"Michael, you were expecting me, right?",pam
28769,Yes I was. Yes I was.,michael
28770,Are you wearing anything under the robe?,pam

28816,[doing situps] I feel weak today. Felt much stronger yesterday. Like Benjamin Button in reverse.,michael
28817,"You know, Michael. When I feel overwhelmed -",pam
28818,"I'm not overwhelmed, Pam.",michael
28819,"I know! No, I'm saying that when I feel overwhelmed, something I like to do is make a list. Make a list of things to do and then start with the easy stuff.",pam
28820,Whatever calms you down.,michael

28822,"Don't patronize me, Pam.",michael
28823,I think you should get dressed.,pam
28824,I'm not getting dressed. I'm not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.,michael
28825,"Michael, that seems impossible.",pam
28826,It's totally impossible!,michael
28827,We need to come up with one realistic thing that we could do today.,pam
28828,Assemble a sales team. A dream team.,michael
28829,Great.,pam
28830,"Okay, Ryan.",michael
28831,No. What? Why?,pam
28832,He's everything I'm not and everything I am. He's the whole package.,michael

28843,"Michael, that's fantastic.",pam
28844,"Yeah, I guess it's not so bad. Got a few things cookin'. [sits down in robe, legs spread wide] Umm...",michael
28845,Hey! We need to get you dressed!,pam
28846,"I have doubts about this too. But when one person freaks out, sometimes it weirdly makes the other one calmer. That's one thing I've learned about relationships. I hate that I just used the word relationship. [Michael comes out in a suit] Hey! You look great! [checks something off her list] Let's go!",pam
28847,Alright.,michael
28848,[laughing at something on his computer],andy
28850,Oh. Oh my God. I'm so embarrassed. You weren't supposed to see this. This is like my secret obsession.,andy
28852,No way!,andy
28854,I hate soccer. But guess who doesn't hate soccer? Charles Miner.,andy
28856,Ahhh. You bastard! That shoulda been me!,andy
28858,Cool!,andy
28859,"I've never been a kiss up. I - it's just not how I operate. I mean, I've always subscribed to the idea that if you really want to impress your boss, you go in there and you do mediocre work. Half-heartedly.",jim
28860,Next on the list - open the mail.,pam
28861,"Oh. Wow. 'Michael Scott Paper Company.' Okay. Very official. 'Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence.'",michael

28879,"I mean, to be fair, I was the first one to talk about it, but...",andy
28881,"Uh, no. Nope. Not really.",jim
28883,It's 'cause I'm more of a player.,jim
28885,You bet.,jim
28886,"Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it.",dwight
28887,Well I do.,jim
28888,Wow.,dwight
28889,I play.,jim
28890,You can be so modest sometimes.,dwight
28891,"Well, maybe you should get back to work.",jim
28892,Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.,dwight
28893,Maybe we will someday.,jim
28894,Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?,dwight
28896,Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table.,dwight
28897,Yeah.,jim
28898,I don't try and be anything that I'm not.,dwight
28900,"Jim, what do you say?",dwight
28902,I'm in it to win.,andy

28922,"Well, it has always been a lifelong dream.",michael
28923,Michael! What's going on?,pam
28924,I'm...,michael
28925,"Hey, Ryan.",pam
28927,Excuse me. Yes?,michael

28931,Yes.,michael
28932,It's not.,pam
28933,It is.,michael
28934,[looks at list] When did you add this to the list?,pam
28935,"Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance. [walks back to Ryan] Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?",michael
28937,You get paid by the year at the bowling alley?,pam
28941,Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company?,michael
28943,"Uh, nine.",michael
28945,No.,pam
28946,[Ryan grabs some shoes] Look what he's doing.,michael
28947,What is he doing?,pam

28970,Beat.,pam
28972,"Vikram, you ask a lot of questions and I like that. Hey, Nana! Hi!",michael
28973,[mouthing to camera] Nana?,pam
28975,"People turn to their families all the time when they need help starting out and if my Nana's investment club can help the Michael Scott Paper Company become a reality, then I'm sure that's what she would have wanted. Does want.",michael
28976,"Well I'm sure that you must all have very, very busy schedules, so I appreciate you meeting with us here today. What this is is a business that I have worked toward my entire life. Hey! [snaps in front of sleeping old man] I have assembled what I believe to be the most exciting, sought-after talent in the industry today. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the dream team. From our very own Scranton, Pennsylvania - Pam Beesly. Pretty Pam is always reaching for the stars and someday, she may just surprise us all and grab one. Meet Vikram. From his humble beginnings as a - stay standing - from his humble beginnings as a prominent surgeon, he risked it all to become the most successful telemarketer in the lipophedrene industry. And do not call it a comeback. The youngest vice president in the history of Dunder Mifflin, and recent bowling alley employee, Ryan Howard is about to make a splash in paper.",michael
28978,"Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.",michael
28980,By wanting it more. By working hard-,michael
28982,Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows: I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee.,michael
28984,Wing.,dwight
28987,Left.,jim
28989,"Forward, definitely.",jim
28991,Striker!,jim
28993,Alright! Let's do it.,jim
28995,Kickoff. [to camera] My strategy is to touch the ball as little as possible. Chalk it up to teamwork. [to team] Alright! [clapping],jim
28996,"And I offer same day, free delivery.",michael
28998,Nana. [softly] I really think that Papa would want you to do this.,michael
29000,"Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don't - it doesn't have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other...",michael
29003,"Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for.",michael
29005,Okay.,michael
29007,Okay.,michael
29010,It means grandmother.,pam
29013,"Get 'im, Jim! C'mon, tough D, Jim. [Charles kicks, ball hits Phyllis in the nose]",andy
29019,What?,jim
29020,"Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?",dwight
29021,"Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice.",jim
29023,"I'm sorry, Phyllis.",jim
29026,"Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup. [to Pam] Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that.",michael
29027,I can't do this.,pam
29028,What's that?,michael
29029,I can't do this. I had a real job. I sat ten feet away from my fiance. I had health benefits. I was just feeling impulsive. I should have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.,pam
29030,Blech.,michael
29031,"I just keep getting bored. And I let things build up and build up and then I - I, I do something too big, like this. Who does this?",pam
29032,Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that's why God made so many.,michael
29033,We don't have any money. We don't have an office. We don't have anything.,pam
29034,"Well we  should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright. [Pam tosses list out car window] Okay...",michael
29035,"How come out of everyone in the office, I'm the only one that went with you? Is it because I'm that stupid? I mean, your own grandmother doesn't even believe in you!",pam
29036,"I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.",michael
29037,Yeah.,pam
29038,"So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... that's it. That's our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I'm gonna go inside. I'm going to make some calls, I'm gonna get us an office space, and I'm going to show you why you joined this company. Okay? [Pam nods]",michael
29039,"You gotta have some extra space. Philly, work with me here. There's gotta be some sort of secret office that you have... lurkin' around... some awesome, free, keep it off the books... Oh, no. Not there. That would be humiliating.",michael
29040,"I did what I had to do. I stepped in. I took charge. That's what being a man is. And earlier today, I was freaking out. Pam stepped up.  She was the man. Don't think a woman can be a man? Well, then that's your stereotype, not mine.",michael
29041,[walks into room] Okay.,michael
29042,I could work here. I could see this.,pam
29043,It's right in the middle of the paper belt.,michael
29044,Are you good?,pam
29045,"Yeah, I'm good. You good?",michael
29046,I'm good.,pam
29047,"You know what they say, keep your friends close. [pointing to office sign where 'Dunder Mifflin' is listed right above 'Michael Scott Pap']",michael
29049,"Yes, I am, Charles.",michael
29051,"Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol' can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin. [Pam and Michael stare him down, he walks away] Actually a six pack. We're gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared.",michael
29052,"It's Britney bitch. And I am back, in the form of a new company. The Michael Scott Paper Company.  [tries to parallel park, hits car.] Okay. Not gonna make this one. [drives away revealing plenty of space for the Cruiser]",michael
29053,LOVE the hair. [Ryan walks up driveway with blonde dyed hair],jim
29054,Morning Michael!,pam
29055,Hello! They took away my parking space but they can't take away my pride! [awkwardly climbs out of his car],michael
29056,"I would like to invite you all to come away with me, on a journey. [nips mylar ribbon with hedge clippers, it won't cut, he tears it down] Welcome! To the Michael Scott Paper Company!",michael
29058,"You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?",jim
29063,"The new receptionist is also named Kelly. So Kelly Kapoor has decided to hover around my desk, so that she can run into his Charles' office every time he calls for Kelly. She thinks if she says 'You wanted me' enough, he will in fact want her. It's not the worse plan she's ever had.",jim
29071,We are in the heart of it. [Bathroom sounds rattle the small office.] And the surge of water carries our business out to the sea.,michael
29072,What should we do now?,pam
29073,"We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.",michael
29074,"I don't know I think we've done absolutely everything you can do to prepare for the day. I've updated our contacts, I have gotten quotes from suppliers. I have sent out an E-vite for our big grand opening pancake luncheon. Six yeses, one maybe, only eleven noes. Um, and 788 not yet replieds. But of that group, 782 have viewed it.",michael
29075,"I am going to need 800 of these, on nice bright paper. It is a coupon for unparalleled customer service. [He sets sheet between Pam and Ryan on desk. Neither takes it.]",michael
29076,"I make that one copy, and I become the girl who makes copies, and by the end of the day I'm receptionist again. And the worst part is, I like making copies. The paper comes out all warm and stuff. And it's cold in there. Cause it's technically a closet.",pam
29077,What do you think?,andy
29078,Let me check. [Pulls out hunting scope] Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.,dwight
29079,Thank you!,andy
29080,"Yes, I am taking Andy hunting after work. Not long ago we were sexual competitors. I used to hate him, hate him, hate him, hate him. I studied him, to figure out why I hated him so much.  But that blossomed into a very real friendship, as these things often do.",dwight
29082,Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.,michael
29085,Hi! [Awkward],jim
29087,Sure!,jim
29089,Okay.,jim
29090,What the hell's a rundown?,jim
29091,When did you need that rundown by?,jim
29093,Okay.,jim
29095,"Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon. [At door.] Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?",jim
29097,You know there's a ghost in this office,dwight
29099,A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.,dwight
29101,"Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor.",dwight
29103,Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.,dwight
29105,It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?,dwight
29107,"That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next.  [Taps her shoulder]",dwight
29109,Just kidding. You finding everything okay?,dwight
29111,Yeah?,dwight
29113,Erin [eerie voice] Erin...,dwight
29114,"Oh, this is awkward. [Andy and Erin 'dance' trying to get out of each other's way]",andy
29116,Uh oh! Oh! Oh! [Andy improvs musical verbage],andy
29118,Hey buddy.,dwight
29119,Hey Ryan? [Ryan watches Montgomery Flea Market ad on YouTube] Could you get to that copy from before?,michael
29121,That is so insulting.,pam
29123,"Because the thing you're saying I'm good at, is pushing a big green button a bunch of times.",pam
29125,Seriously? Because it sounds like one of those is better than the other.,pam
29127,"Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don't make copies, I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals.",michael
29129,Shut up!,pam
29130,Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it!,michael
29131,Really!,pam
29134,Would someone just make the copy?,michael
29136,Just make that copy okay?,michael
29137,"Seriously? This is what's so important, putting naked pictures on the desktop?",pam
29139,I don't want to look at your friend Jasmine's boobs all day.,pam
29141,Like how? Dyeing my hair blond?,pam
29143,Oh yeah I bet.,pam
29144,"They're getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he's too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim.",michael

29147,Okay it's my turn.,pam
29149,Give it back for what? What're you gonna do with it?,pam
29151,You're gonna make another 'spreadsheet.',pam
29153,Yeah exactly. It's my turn.,pam
29155,Come on! Ryan!,pam
29156,"They always say that it is a mistake to hire your friends and they are right! So, I hired my best friends. And this is what I get?",michael
29157,"Hey buddy, what are you up to?",dwight
29158,"Um, nerthing?",andy
29159,"Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis.",dwight
29160,Pffft.,andy
29161,"Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?",dwight
29162,"The last thing I want to do, is step on your funk man.",andy
29163,"And I, yours. So I will cede her to you.",dwight
29164,"No, that's ridiculous.",andy
29165,No no no.,dwight

29167,"Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just, [They Hi-5 badly] Boom.",dwight
29168,Listen up. It has come to my attention that some people in this office are not getting along with other people in this office. And I think I have come up with the reason why. This office space is too small.,michael
29169,Definitely.,pam
29170,Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.,michael
29171,We could work from home.,pam
29173,"Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right?  1,2,3- What are we gonna do?",michael
29174,.... Corner idea?,pam
29175,"No, you're supposed to say, 'Rock the house.'",michael
29177,How would we know that?,pam
29178,"Hey dude, you know what a 'rundown' is?",jim
29180,"Uh, can you get this rundown for me?' [impersonating Charles]",jim

29191,I thought that was your corner.,pam

29223,Well it was great catching up with you. And I'll see you around the building.,pam
29225,I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit longer if that's okay. The air smells so good. I don't remember it smelling so good. The chairs are so comfortable.,pam

29248,Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?,jim

29262,You're good.,dwight
29264,"That was great, but it's just sort of, it's still a little choppy like. But don't worry, it's hard, it took me a while too. It's like [Andy plays Country Roads on his banjo.]",andy
29266,What? Oh my God you heard that I'm so embarrassed. I'm like so rusty.,andy
29267,"Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it.",dwight

29295,Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Dancing in the office],michael
29296,"Who would have thought, that the thing that would save this company would be work? And pancakes? In the end, this day definitely had its ups and downs. I realize that we don't have the biggest office. Which is a surprise, because 165 square feet sounds like a lot. But, we have people with the biggest hearts. And I think for a small company that is really [flushing] Someone went to the bathroom. That is really what's important.",michael
29297,Literally every song is better a cappella. Name a song.,andy

29307,Yeah.,andy
29308,Hup! [throws cheese puff to Ryan who catches it in his mouth],michael
29309,Things are a little slow here. And there's only so much cold-calling you can do in a day. Turns out there's no limit to the number of cheese puffs you can throw at someone's face.,pam
29310,Hup! [throws cheese puff to Pam who catches it in her mouth],michael
29311,We're getting pretty good at it.,pam

29319,"Well, 12 guys, airfare, three nights in a hotel, food per diem, table up front for merch... $9,000.",andy

29321,Did you even hear the music I just played for you?,andy
29322,Mm-hmm.,pam
29324,These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.,dwight
29326,Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence.,dwight

29329,"When Michael was in charge, this place was like the Roman Empire. And the Wild West. And war-torn Poland. And Poland. There was just a lot going on, so what you wore to work was the least of anybody's worries. And in that chaos, I soared.",dwight

29342,"Yes, I do.",michael
29343,But don't forget you owe me $10.,dwight
29344,That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go?,michael
29345,Michael.,dwight
29346,What was up with Pam being all pushy and negative in there?,andy
29347,I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake.,jim
29348,It scares me to see you going down a road that I went down.,andy
29349,Am I going down a road?,jim
29350,"When I see her bossing you around like that, it just makes me wonder if this thing really has the legs to go the distance.",andy

29355,I'm not gonna do that.,pam
29356,That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?,michael
29358,"Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.",michael
29360,Bring it in. Morning cheer. [clears throat],michael
29362,I'm here. I'm a part of this now.,pam
29363,You needed to speak to me?,dwight
29365,I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.,dwight
29367,Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.,dwight
29369,Your concern is noted.,dwight
29371,Like a wolf. Thank you.,dwight
29373,Really?,dwight
29375,[sighs] It's firm.,dwight
29376,[on phone] I need you to get me the prices that you're charging Ed's tires so I can undercut Dunder Mifflin.,michael

29378,Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?,michael
29379,"No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast.",dwight
29380,I'm not following you.,michael

29383,"Good, do you see what I'm saying?",dwight
29384,Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing?,michael
29385,No.,dwight
29386,Can I use it? [Pam holds up note saying 'He's talking about you!'],michael
29387,No.,dwight
29388,"[Michael dismisses note, Ryan and Pam point to notepad] Dwight, are you talking about us?",michael
29389,It is possible that I could be talking about us.,dwight
29390,Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?,michael
29391,It is the situation that we are in now.,dwight
29392,"So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you?",michael
29393,I'm not a barbarian.,dwight
29394,Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?,michael
29395,I will.,dwight

29402,Noishe.',andy
29403,-I just don't know if I can do it.,jim
29404,"That's interesting, because I hear what you're saying is that you want to do it, which means you can do it. Believe me, I broke up with Angela, and I'm like, the happiest guy ever. I mean, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Like, total freedom, you know?",andy
29405,"It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy.",jim
29406,"And you know what? I am here for you. Let me be your traveling pants. [imitates punching on Jim's fist] Ah, what'd you do that for?",andy

29425,I. Understand. Nothing.,michael
29426,[Michael storms into office] Wow.,michael
29427,"Michael, are you alright?",pam
29428,It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.,michael

29432,We can't help you if you don't just tell us what happened.,pam
29433,"I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don't know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don't know. Is that clear enough for you?",michael

29454,Dammit! [hangs up],dwight
29455,[on phone] Is Mr. Schofield there?,michael
29458,I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried.,dwight

29463,"I spent a month putting that rolodex on his Blackberry, which he now uses as a nightlight.",pam
29464,Wow. High score?,michael
29465,"And no, I cannot lower my current prices. [phone rings] Hold on. Hello? Mr. Schofield, thank you so much for taking the time to talk. I wanted to discuss your contract with us- oh, you're considering him. I thought Michael Scott left the paper business after his nervous breakdown.",dwight
29466,"Michael has been talking to my biggest client. Master and apprentice pitted against one another for the fate of the greater Scranton area paper market.  So it's not exactly like 'Highlander,' but still...",dwight

29482,Michael.,dwight

29484,You were making me do things that were not all right.,dwight

29486,And not come through for you?,dwight
29487,"If you want a truce, I will give you a truce.",michael
29488,I want a truce.,dwight
29489,I do too.,michael

29497,I hit a bear.,dwight
29498,What?,michael
29499,"He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo. [throws a fish into the vent at Michael's office] Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese?",dwight

29514,On purpose?,michael
29515,Yes.,dwight
29516,Why?,michael
29517,"You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf!",dwight
29518,"Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.",michael
29519,And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!,dwight

29521,"Hi there. Dwight Schrute here. I was just calling to see if Michael Scott Paper was meeting all of your paper needs, and how is [reading off rolodex card] Brenda, age four, ponytail, and Simon, age 7? Oh, you don't say.",dwight

29539,"[on speakerphone in Dwight's car] Now, when Dwight tells you that he will keep prices steady for a year, I think he is speaking out of turn.",michael
29541,"Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.",michael
29542,Are you saying you invented paper?,dwight

29560,What is that thing that Dwight always says? Paper is the soil in which the seeds of business grow?,michael
29561,It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah! [runs into office],dwight
29563,Spin move.,dwight
29565,"Ha ha! April 13th, 2002.",dwight
29567,That's very rude.,michael

29571,"I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin...",michael
29572,Come on.,dwight

30072,Who quits?,michael
30075,Me too.,andy
30076,You guys gotta be kidding.,michael

30078,"I love it.  I love this idea, and I fully support you.  As a matter of fact, I'm going to give you some seed money.  [throws money at Phyllis] There you go.  There's some seed money for you.

30080,Yes I do.,michael

30082,It's frontward's.,michael
30085,Right.,dwight
30087,"No matter how I look at this, I am in the wrong.  And I have looked at this thing, like a hundred different ways.  From my point of view, from their point of view...98 others.  And the bottom line, I am in the wrong.  I'm the bad guy.",michael
30088,I need you to arrange a meeting between me and the sales staff without Ryan and Pam knowing.,michael

30104,"If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say,  'apology accepted', I think we would all feel better.  And then we can break out  my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark.",michael

30108,"Okay.  If I give you your clients back there won't be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.",michael

30111,That's fair.,dwight
30112,You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.,michael
30115,He can only keep one of us as a salesperson now.  He'll make his decision by the end of the day.,pam

30119,Yeah.,pam

30127,Sure.  Let me just finish this turn.,jim
30128,[puts Scrabble pieces on board] And Bingo was his name.  Let's go.,michael
30130,I need your help.  This whole Pam/Ryan debate is screwing with my head.,michael

30138,Okay.,michael
30139,He definitely stole my iPod.,jim
30140,That sounds pretty biased.,michael
30141,You didn't hear my pros.  Environmentally-conscious 'cause his mom drives him to work everyday.,jim
30142,"Okay. Pam, pros.",michael
30143,Mm-hmm.,jim

30145,That's not true.,jim
30146,I don't need to tell you that.,michael
30147,I think she'd be a really good salesperson.,jim
30148,"I don't think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven't said one bad thing about Pam.",michael
30149,And I won't.,jim
30150,"Okay.  So be it, then you've lost credibility.  And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan.",michael
30151,"All right.  You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But that's not a weird voice.",jim
30152,"Oh, wow!  Whoa!",michael
30153,Take it easy.,jim
30154,"Ho-ho, man!  Wow. [in a high-pitched voice] Honey!  I want you to bring the garbage out.  'Cause I'm not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba--",michael
30155,I have a very difficult decision to make.  It's like last week I was at the video store.  Do I rent Devil Wears Prada again? Or do I finally get around to seeing Sophie's Choice?  It is what you would call a classic difficult decision.,michael

30189,What about Ryan?,pam
30190,"I don't know, I offered him his temp job back.  We'll see.  He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so--",michael
30191,Yeah.  Maybe you shouldn't fake fire people anymore.,pam

I wrote down a list of bullet points why Holly and I should be together, and I'm going to find the perfect moment today and I am going to tell her. Number one: 'Holly, you and I are soup snakes.' The-and the reason is... because... in terms of the soup, we like to- that doesn't make any sense. We're soul mates. Holly and I are soul mates.",michael

30774,Okay. Fine.,dwight

30777,Dwight.,andy
30778,"No, no, hear me out. Five? Six?",dwight
30780,Seven? Can I finish please?,dwight
30782,Eight?,dwight
30783,"[on the phone] Oh, Dwight, we're so close! Just buy us a few more minutes... Well, they just called me in for an update, so I'll call you right back... Okay... Okay, great.

30840,[annoyed] How do you know this?,michael
30841,"[still typing] People tell me things. I guess I have a face you can trust. I think it's because of my low cheekbones. And... boom. [finishes typing, turns to face Michael] Okay, what is it, what can't I guess?",dwight

30893,[approaching Michael] You have to stop this.,jim

30923,Uh huh. [gestures to Kevin to keep it quiet] Alright?,michael
30924,"How do you un-tell something? You can't. You can't put words back in your mouth. What you can do is spread false gossip so that people think that everything that's been said is untrue, including 'Stanley is having an affair.' It's like the end of Spartacus. I've seen that movie half a dozen times, and I still don't know who the real Spartacus is, and that is what makes that movie a classic whodunit.",michael

30948,Hahaha! I like it a lot! I love tea!,andy
30950,WHAT??,andy
30952,[serious] Who told you that? Was it Broccoli Rob? Someone from Chi Psi? Or did you run into someone from my high school?,andy
30953,"This is not the first time rumors about me being gay have come up. Twice before, actually. Just a weird coincidence... a little too weird. [chuckles nervously] Almost makes you wonder if it's not a coincidence at all. Whoa! Which it is, of course. [long pause] But it makes you wonder.",andy
30954,[to Oscar in break room] Did you hear the rumor about me? That I'm gay?,andy
30956,And?,andy
30958,Do you think it's true? Do you think that I'm... gay?,andy
30960,"[scoffs and chuckles] No! But, let me kick you a scenario. I'm at a beach cabana, and Brad Pitt approaches. He tries to lean in and kiss me. I would definitely resist, like at first.

30962,"Would I push him away? How hard? Like, what if he's like really aggressive?",andy

30974,[to Eric] You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.,jim
30975,"Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right. [interns do nothing] One of you will do exceedingly well in business, just unlimited potential. One of you will make a living, and nothing more. And one of you [looks directly at Megan] will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be.",dwight
30978,"[to Jim] Tuna, how come you never try to set me up?",andy

31010,Who did you tell?,pam
31011,I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?,jim
31012,Nobody!,pam
31017,"Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?",jim
31019,"[entering conference room] Yeah, yeah... you know what? Let's discredit these rumors.",michael
31020,"Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff?",jim
31021,"That's not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn't listen to any of that crap.",michael
31022,"Sure, but we should get to the bottom of this. Let's pick a rumor and trace it back to the beginning.",pam
31025,I heard it from Erin.,andy
31027,[quietly leaves room],michael
31028,[approaching Michael at elevators] Michael? [to others] He's over here!,pam
31029,[to Michael] Where are you going?,pam
31030,Nowhere.,michael
31031,"Michael... [leads Michael to corner of vestibule, then whispers] You told people I use store-bought manure, when I showed you where my manure comes from. Hmm? Hmm? [Michael looks nervously to camera as elevator doors open]",dwight
31032,Don't get on it. [Michael inches toward elevator],pam
31033,"Michael, don't.",jim
31034,Don't... get... on. Do not.,pam
31035,Michael...,jim
31037,Step away.,pam
31039,[reluctantly exits elevator],michael
31040,"[to everyone, in conference room] Okay, I made it all up.",michael
31042,Even the fact that I'm gay?,andy
31043,Yes.,michael
31044,[relieved] Yes!,andy
31045,"But guys, I'm a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I'm a J. Crew model.",michael
31047,"Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself.",michael
31049,"Because a lot of people think that models, even though they're very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It's set our industry back quite a bit.",michael
31052,"Okay, okay... here's the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn't want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.",michael
31055,Michael... am I gay?,andy
31056,"[sighs] The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person's life, is that...",michael
31057,[interrupting] That Pam's pregnant.,jim
31060,Okay. Thank you.,jim
31064,Who's the father?,dwight
31065,Jim.,pam
31067,Four months.,jim
31069,Stop. Don't. Just...,pam
31070,"Alright, alright... you know, this is not the truth, and you can't fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair.",michael
31071,Nope.,jim
31072,Yes. Jim...,michael
31073,"[arm around Pam] Thank you for trying to defend her. But actually, Pam is pregnant, and we can prove it.",jim
31074,Yes.,pam
31075,If everyone would like to see proof.,jim
31076,Okay. [leaves room],pam
31080,Look at that! [grabs sonogram from Pam] That is the inside of your vagina! [Jim takes sonogram from Michael],michael
31081,"[talking head with Jim] It's clear why we were trying not to tell people. That's clear now. [Jim nods, looking at floor]",pam
31082,[to Jim and Pam] How long have you known about the pregnancy?,michael
31084,A week? A month? A year?,michael
31085,"Michael, we only told our parents last week.",jim
31086,Did you pee on a stick?,michael
31087,I did. It was inconclusive.,jim
31088,You should've told me.,michael
31089,[exchanges looks with Jim] You're right. We should've realized that you are an equal part of this.,pam
31090,"[phone rings, hits speaker button]",michael
31092,[gasps],michael
31093,[in disbelief] You called Stanley's wife?,pam
31094,"Oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh... oh God.",michael
31095,Don't take it.,jim
31096,"No, I have to take it, or it'll seem suspicious.",michael
31097,"If you talk to her, you're gonna tell her about Stanley, and that's gonna seem more suspicious.",pam
31098,"No, no, I can do this.",michael
31099,You can't do this.,jim
31100,"Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won't talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over.",michael
31101,That sounds terrible.,jim
31102,"Michael, please don't.",pam
31103,"[picking up phone] Hey, what up, Cynthia? [lowers phone, looking terrified]",michael
31104,"[gets up to leave room, Michael gestures for him to stay]",jim
31105,"Hold on a second, Cynthia.",michael
31106,"[hangs up Michael's phone, leaves room]",jim
31107,"Well, it turns out that Teri was already suspicious, because she had caught Stanley and Cynthia a few months ago. So Stanley promised that he would stop, and he did, end of story. Well, not exactly. [camera pans down from Michael's office window to parking lot below, Stanley is seen destroying Michael's Sebring with a crowbar] Uhh, Cynthia kept calling him, she would not stop calling him, and she was in love with him. Oh, and get this. Cynthia, also married. So... you can't stop love, I guess [Jim is seen displaying fetus picture on his desk as Pam smiles] and quite frankly, I don't think you should ever try.",michael
31116,[knock at Michael's Office door] Yeah?,michael
31118,"Yes, Oscar come on in.  Close the door if you would.  Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me.",michael
31120,I'm going in for a procedure today.,michael
31122,"Yeah, it's routine.  I'm just a little bit scared.",michael
31124,It is a colonoscopy.,michael
31126,"In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions? [Oscar looks irritated and frustrated] Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?",michael
31128,"My main concern, should I have a safe word?",michael
31131,"Abso... you know what? I'll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night.",michael
31133,"Ho, Hol, hold on big guy, I'm gonna put it in the mail Sunday night and you'll get it Weds.",michael
31135,Sure.,jim
31136,"Hey, Good luck.",pam
31137,"Oh right, this thing. I remember now.  [whispers to Jim]  What's this about?",michael
31138,"Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay.",jim
31139,It's okay with me but he's gonna want me in there.,michael
31141,Really?,michael
31143,"Alright, do you mind if it sit this out?  I have so much work to do, I feel like I'm gonna blow my brains out.",michael
31145,"Am I worried that Jim and David are having a meeting without me?  No, because we are the Three Amigos.  And once in awhile one of the Amigos will go off... to the bathroom... while the other two have a secret meeting.  [shrugs]",michael
31146,Hey let me escort you to your desk.,michael
31147,"Okay, it's just three or four steps but thank you, thank you.",pam
31148,"You and Jim are close, huh?",michael
31149,"Yeah, I think the pregnancy really brought us together.",pam
31150,"Hey, what do you think he and David are talking about? What do you...",michael
31151,"Ummm, I don't know.",pam
31152,"Well, you said good luck to Jim as he walked in.",michael
31153,"Did I?  Doesn't sound like me, not very superstitious.",pam
31154,"If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar.  That's how it works.  They inherit things through the breast milk.",michael
31155,Please don't talk about my breast milk.,pam
31156,I just don't want you to lie to me.  I don't want you to ever lie to me.  Have I ever lied to you?,michael
31157,Yeah.,pam
31158,I just don't want you to.,michael
31162,"Hmmm, interesting.  How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?",dwight
31164,"Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country.  I didn't know we were in communist Sweden.",dwight
31166,"Nnnnn, that's not... okay.",dwight
31168,I'm talking about... hmmm.,dwight
31171,"So long Darryl, feel better... [to Toby] He's lying.",dwight
31173,"Oh? From who, Dr. J?  Look, you really need to investigate this.  People don't just fall off of ladders.",dwight
31175,Since when have you known Darryl to rush to do anything other than to come up here for birthday cake?  [imitating Darryl]  Y'all having birthday cake?,dwight
31177,Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?,dwight
31179,It just doesn't add up.,dwight
31181,"[walks into conference room on his cell phone, interrupting David and Jim] Uh huh, well if he doesn't like it you can tell that SOB that he is fired.  Sorry, I'm going into a meeting right now.  I will... I love you too.  Bye.",michael
31182,Who was that?,jim
31183,Sorry about that.  What'd I miss?,michael
31185,"Do not mind!  Yes, I do!  No, I don't.  Yes, I do!  No, I don't mind.  Catch you guys on the flippity flop.  Oh this... call waiting.  [answers his phone] Yeah, uh huh,  well you tell the Mayor he just lost six votes.",michael
31187,Yeah.,michael
31189,Nope.,michael
31191,"No, I think they're talking about me.",michael
31193,"What is Jim telling him?  That I can't handle this job?  That 's bull crap.  That is bull crap.  Although, it has been chaotic lately.  Corporate shut down the Buffalo branch which left us to absorb all of their clients.  I will tell you there has been work everyday.  Had to come in on a Saturday. To retrieve... I left my cell phone here.",michael
31194,Hey Kelly.,pam
31196,"Thank you.  Um, listen I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to the wedding, which is totally understandable and more than fine.",pam
31198,"I don't know, he hasn't RSVP'd yet.",pam
31199,"We invited everyone in the office to our wedding.  Even though we realized most people wouldn't be able to make the drive to Niagara Falls.  [whispers] Which is why we're having it in Niagara Falls.  [normal volume] Then Michael told everyone they could have Friday and Monday  off, if they came.  So now, people have to decide if they want to come to our wedding or have to work.",pam
31201,What can I do for ya Hoss?,andy
31202,[staring into the conference room] How are your sales doin'?,michael
31203,"How are my sales doin'?  Busted.  My numbers are down a little bit and it's 'cause of the economy.  You're not buying it, you're good.  Okay the truth is, I have been having trouble focusing lately.  I'm in this weird, flirty, nebulous thing with this cousin of mine and it's a total mind effer.",andy
31205,"Oh, I'm sorry Phyllis, you explain this email, okay.   'Hey Andy let's go visit grandma and then get drunk together, ha ha.'",andy
31206,"Shhh, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on in that room, okay?",michael
31207,Wallace had to show up on the one four month period that I'm completely overwhelmed.,michael
31208,"You know when they say it's so crazy it just might work?  Well, I don't believe that.  I say go for the air-tight plan and that is why I am having Andy wheel me into the conference room inside a makeshift cheese cart.  It is just elegant.",michael
31209,[in the cheese cart] Be my eyes.,michael
31210,You got it.,andy
31212,"Oh, just backing up and turning around.",andy
31214,"Dit, dit, dit, dit, it's not for you. [enters the conference room]  Pardon moi, Messieurs.  I took the liberty of preparing for you a cheese platter which I will place here on the eastern wall of the conference room.",andy
31216,"Oui, Oui, Monsieur.  From the Wisconsin region, a nice firm cheddar.  Also from the great state of Wisconsin, an aged parmesan.  Here you will find a cheddar style spread which has reacted nicely with the air to form a light rind which I think you'll  find both challenging and delicious.  At that point, I would recommend you take a trip south of the border to the great state of Illinois where you will find this fine Bleu Cheese dressing.  If I may be so bold, it's a lot of fun to let the goldfish take a little swim in the bleu cheese.  Bon appetit.",andy
31218,"No, I won't.   Alright, thanks for giving me your time,  I appreciate it.",jim
31222,"[crawls out of the cheese cart unseen] Hey, hey, you must have walked right past me.  How you doin'?",michael
31224,"Yes, definitely.",michael
31226,"Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched.",dwight
31228,I have been my whole life.,dwight
31230,I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.,dwight
31232,Yeah.,dwight
31234,"Yeah, it's just a run of the mill slaughter house, but sure anytime.",dwight
31236,"Wa... wa... wait , someone's coming.",dwight
31238,"Here, get down! He's not using crutches!  Get the camera!",dwight
31240,"Oh, worker's comp, my ass!",dwight
31242,Toby...,dwight
31244,Ooohhh... [crashes car into garbage cans]  Oh man!  You okay?,dwight
31246,Hey Ryan.,pam
31248,"So, I just wanted to confirm that you're not coming to my wedding.",pam
31250,It costs about $75 per person.,pam
31252,Can you just tell me now if you're coming or not?,pam
31254,"Okay, Ryan Howard, yes.",pam
31256,"Kelly Kapoor, yes.",pam
31258,Look who you're talking to.,michael
31260,"Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever.",michael
31262,[looks at Jim]   Permission to speak on the record?,michael
31264,"Jim is like Big Bird.  He is tall and yellow and very nice.  But would I put him in charge?  No, I don't think so.  Because Big Bird doesn't make the tough decisions.  I... If I was gonna put someone in charge, I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like Maria or Gordon, maybe.",michael
31266,"Very much, Jim is my best friend. But it's his performance report... right here.  Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable.",michael
31268,"It's not very well written, but you get the gist.",michael
31270,I can just continue to run it myself.,michael
31272,This was Jim's idea?,michael
31274,"Wow.  Ummm, well I'd have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block.",michael
31276,"I didn't tell Michael because I thought he'd try to help.  Example, he handed out Jello shots at the 23rd mile of the Steamtown marathon.",jim
31278,Sure.,jim
31279,"[after talking to David, Jim looks dejected] I can't help but feel partially responsible.",michael
31280,[shakes jelly beans] Little pick me up?  [Jim accepts] Oh those are the best.  Little sugar rush.,michael
31281,"When you were in the office earlier talking to Wallace, did I come up at all?",jim
31282,Well we did talk about how handsome you are.,michael
31283,Why don't we head in your office to talk?,jim
31284,"Oh what a week, God.  We said... I know there were certain things we said...",michael
31285,"Michael, look I'll just be honest with you.  Earlier today I spoke with Wallace about a promotion.  I actually think that talk went really well.  And then after he spoke with you, for some reason it felt like things had changed.",jim
31286,"Hmmm, that's weird, that's weird... it's kinda weirding me out.  Did you know that Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy.",michael
31287,"Michael, did you say anything?",jim
31288,"Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion.",michael
31289,Really?,jim
31290,Yes!,michael
31291,You will?  Wanna do it right now?,jim
31292,Yes.,michael
31293,I tried to keep Michael in the dark.  I should have known that he can do just as much damage in the dark.,jim
31294,I need to see your pupils.   I need to see if they're dilated.,dwight
31299,We thought that she was you.,dwight
31301,Are you... are you serious?  Be... cause you look exactly alike.  Am I the only one?  Are you getting this?,dwight
31304,"Aww, Darryl.",dwight
31308,"Hey David, this is Michael Scott.  [Jim pushes speaker phone button]  Michael Scott here.",michael
31310,Just wanted to talk to you about  Jim Halpert.  I understand that he did not receive the promotion.  And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.,michael
31312,"Absolutely, [turns speakerphone off] not. [turns speakerphone back on]  Like I said before, Jim is fantastic and he deserves this job.",michael
31314,"Wha... here's the thing, Jim is the best man for this job, I think you should give it to him.",michael
31316,"Well, nnnn, that... that was an anomaly.  That file had been falsified.  Toby Flenderson is doing drugs.",michael
31320,Wait!  They're using the lift as their own personal elevator.,dwight
31322,"He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed.",dwight
31324,Really?  Then why is there new wood only on one railing?  Hmmm?   We should check the security tapes Toby.,dwight
31327,Yes!,dwight
31329,"Now, I would like to file an official complaint to corporate because Darryl lied on an official form.",dwight
31331,Phhhht.  No judge is gonna believe that...,dwight
31334,"Hey, hey Jim, it would make me feel really good right now if you would just punch me in the face.  Alright,  Just do it.",michael
31335,How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.,jim
31336,"I never recommended you because I didn't want to lose you and I didn't want to lose Pam, [starts to choke up] and now I don't wanna lose the baby.",michael
31337,"So instead, you screwed me?",jim
31338,That's what she...,michael
31339,No.,jim
31341,Kind of in the middle of something here.,michael
31343,"I, yeah... no, I'll tell him myself.  Let's both.",michael
31344,[on phone] Hello.,michael
31346,"No, it's just us.",michael
31348,"Oh, oh, well here he is right now.  [Michael knocks on desk]  Come in.  [Makes sound effects for door opening and footsteps and points to Jim to answer]",michael
31349,Hi David.,jim
31351,Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager.,michael
31353,"Wow, that sounds pretty cool.",jim
31354,"I like that, so manager and co-manager.",michael
31356,Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.,michael
31358,"Okay people,  listen up, I have an announcement to make, fraud was committed...",dwight
31359,"Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make... whoa do you have an announcement?",michael
31360,I'm... I was making it.,dwight
31361,"Everybody, David Wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager.",michael
31363,"Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts.",michael
31365,"What's happening to me?  I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together.  Jim Halpert, welcome.",michael
31366,[shakes Michael's hand] Thank you. [Dwight looks disappointed and angry behind them],jim
31367,AHHHHHHHHHHHH!,dwight
31369,Do you think that you could send in your RSVP card?,pam
31371,"Well, you have to choose a food option and there's information in there about directions and lodging...",pam
31373,"You are going to text me, the morning of my wedding.",pam
31375,To ask for directions..,pam
31377,And you will eat whatever is fanciest?,pam
31380,"So rude, right?",pam
31382,"[sits down] Oh my gosh, I have been chasing people down all day.  It's incredible.",pam
31384,[in Michael's office] Could you please sign my expense report?,dwight
31385,"No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic.",michael
31386,[in Jim's office]  Sign this.,dwight
31387,"Ah, ah, ah. Where's the 'please'? We're not animals.",jim
31388,Sign it.,dwight
31389,"No, not without a 'please.'",jim
31390,Idiot.,dwight
31391,[in Michael's office] I have a complaint about Jim.,dwight
31392,That is not big picture.,michael
31393,"I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.",dwight
31394,... Okay.,michael
31395,Jim won't sign my expense report.,dwight
31396,That is not-- okay-- that is day-to-day.,michael
31397,"No, that is huge.",dwight
31398,You're trying to trick me.,michael
31399,This has to do--,dwight
31400,"Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.",michael
31401,[in Jim's office] I'd like to lodge a complaint.,dwight
31402,I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?,jim
31403,You!,dwight
31404,Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?,jim
31405,One minute ago.,dwight
31406,Okay. And how do you feel?,jim
31407,Angry.,dwight
31408,All right. Did he hit you?,jim
31409,No.,dwight
31410,Did you cry?,jim
31411,No.,dwight
31412,Did you feel like crying?,jim
31413,No.,dwight
31414,I'm just gonna write 'held back tears.',jim
31415,"Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.",dwight
31416,"If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it.",jim
31417,I'm not cr-- uhh!,dwight
31418,"I deserved that promotion, not Jim. Oh, man. Makes me want to put him in a triangle choke hold and force him down to the ground and just keep pressing and pressing. And then flip him over and then put him in a hammer lock! And he's gasping, he's panting! Every last breath! And the crowd is going crazy. And boom! I emerge victorious! [claps hands and stands up] Aha! $18,000 and a chance at the title! Ooh hah!",dwight
31420,"Everyone, now would be a good time to freshen up, because I'd like everyone to meet in the conference room in five minutes. And I suggest that you bring a snack, because we may be in there for a while.",michael
31421,Michael...,jim
31422,Yes?,michael
31423,Can I talk to you in my office for a second?,jim
31424,"Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?",michael
31427,I have noticed that we--,jim
31428,Welcome.,michael
31429,Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings.,jim
31430,Mm-hmm.,michael
31431,"And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--",jim
31432,Disruptive.,michael
31433,Yes.,jim
31434,"No, I don't think they are. I think the meetings are very important.",michael
31435,"Okay, maybe we should talk specifics.",jim
31436,Let's do.,michael
31437,"Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.",jim
31438,"N-- well, to be fair, Jim... James... Jimothy... To be fair, Jimothy, the-- ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim?",michael
31439,I am.,jim
31440,"Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn't about planets...",michael
31441,Right.,jim
31442,"At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.",michael
31443,"Yes, I agree.",jim
31444,"Because it's a big universe, and we're all just little, tiny specks of dust.",michael
31445,I just think that maybe they're eating large amounts of the day.,jim
31446,"You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea.",michael
31447,You mean on a weekend?,jim
31448,Yes.,michael
31449,How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential.,jim
31450,Alright. No more meetings this week.,michael
31451,Really? You just agreed to that?,jim
31452,I can be very suprising.,michael
31454,"I need to fit into my wedding dress. However, I'm also pregnant.",pam
31457,"We did, but mostly because people expect us to. We're also accepting other gifts not on the registry... However much.",pam
31458,"It's awkward asking people for money, but we could really use it. Why doesn't Crate & Barrel let you register for a toaster full of cash?",pam
31460,"Oh, good.",pam
31462,"No, we're not.",pam
31464,Mm-hmm?,michael
31465,"[walks in, see's Oscar, Stanley, Creed and Kelly sitting in Michaels office] Okay, I thought I saw people missing.",jim
31466,"Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each.",michael
31467,"Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?",jim
31468,"Stanley, you don't need to answer that.",michael
31469,Stanley?,jim
31471,"Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these.",jim
31472,What do you mean by 'these people'?,michael
31473,"Michael, this is a conference room meeting.",jim
31474,"Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.",michael
31475,That's not what I meant.,jim
31476,"Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want.",michael
31477,I disagree.,jim
31478,What do you guys think? [all start talking at the same time],michael
31479,"Great. Guys, can I just have a moment alone with Michael?",jim
31480,"No, no, no, you don't need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people.",michael
31481,"That is not what I said, and, also, I am co-manager, meaning you are not the only manager anymore. I am also I co-manager.",jim
31482,That is not what Wallace told us.,michael
31483,That's exactly what Wallace told us.,jim
31484,That is not the way I heard it.,michael
31486,"It is one thing, me giving you the co-manager title. It is another thing, you bossing me around.",michael
31487,"I'm not bossing you around. I'm trying to do my job, which is sharing your job, so maybe we should just call David Wallace.",jim
31488,"No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace. [Michael pulls out his cell phone] I will call David Wallace.",michael
31490,Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why don't we just--,michael
31491,"Hey, David. You got Jim here.",jim
31492,"Hey David, this is Michael, senior co-manager.",michael
31494,"Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision.",michael
31495,Which will clearly affect the day-to-day well-being of our employees.,jim
31497,Which is it more of?,michael
31499,"David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work.",jim
31501,I thought maybe we could talk after this is over.,michael
31503,"Nope, not at all.",jim
31504,"No, it will not be. I am on top of it.",michael
31506,"Alright, thanks alot, David.",jim
31507,"Talk to you later-- [Jim hangs up] Okay, you didn't let me say good-bye. [sighs, and claps hands once] Alright, I am looking forward to this.",michael
31508,You don't have to lie.,jim
31509,"I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don't see you anymore.",michael
31510,Right.,jim
31511,All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.,michael
31512,Alright. Let's get started.,jim
31515,"You know, there's no easy way to do this. I say we add 1.5% to their paychecks and don't say anything about it.",michael
31516,"Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?",jim
31517,"No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, Jim.",michael
31518,Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options.,jim
31519,"Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?",michael
31520,It's hard to tell so far.,jim
31521,You use your brain too much.,michael
31522,"I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?",jim
31523,Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all.,michael
31524,You just came up with that.,jim
31525,As I was saying it.,michael
31526,"Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit.",jim
31527,[in nerdy voice] Con-- you look like a nerd.,michael
31528,Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.,jim
31529,Pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.,michael
31530,Pro-- no favoritism.,jim
31531,"Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there.",michael
31532,"I've been studying Michael for years, and I've condensed what I've learned into this chart-- [pulls out a pie chart] How Michael spends his time. As you can see, we have procrastinating and distracting others, and this tiny sliver here is critical thinking. I made it bigger, so that you could see it.",jim
31534,I don't think we registered anywhere. We just want cash.,pam
31536,Mm-hmm.,pam
31538,Yeah.,pam
31540,Okay.,pam
31542,Is this what I've become? Materialistic? Shallow? I feel horrible. [looks down at the check] oh look! 'Mrs. Pam Halpert!' That's the first time I've seen it in writing!,pam
31543,"You know, the more I think about it, the more I think we should give it to the salesmen.",jim
31544,That will not go over well.,michael
31545,"I know. I just think it seems smart to keep the salesmen happy right now. 'Course I know that this might come off as biased, so you know what? Let us...",jim
31546,"Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna kill myself.",michael
31547,I'm not gonna let you stop me from thinking.,jim
31548,"No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue.",michael
31549,Michael.,jim
31550,And then another--,michael
31551,"Look, you have a lot of strengths.",jim
31552,"Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are.",michael
31553,I think that you are able to take constructive criticism very well.,jim
31554,Ha! That-- I am not known for that!,michael
31555,But there is a reason why I'm here!,jim
31556,Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!,michael
31557,"No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!",jim
31558,"Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don't you enliven me?",michael
31559,I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!,jim
31560,Ah.,michael
31561,"At thinking out the options, and then stating that decision very clearly, especially when it's an unpopular decision.",jim
31562,"Okay, here's a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?!",michael
31563,"But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table.",jim
31564,"Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don't you run yourself out there and tell them? [laughs] You call it.",michael
31565,[leave the conference room to address everyone],jim
31566,[to the camera] This had better be terrible.,michael
31567,"Could I have everyone's attention, please? I have some tough news, so I'm just gonna give it to you straight. Truth is, we only have so much money for raises this year, so the simple fact is some people will get raises, and some people won't. Now, what we've decided is, we are gonna give those raises to the sales staff.",jim
31569,"Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults.",jim
31573,"Ooh, easy. That's not it at all.",jim
31575,"Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.",jim
31581,This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!,dwight
31582,"Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--",jim
31583,"What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!",dwight
31591,"Her kid needs shoes, Jim!",dwight
31593,"Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so... [imitates a tape rewinding and chuckles, Michael comes over by Jim laughing]",jim
31594,"That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it's hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you [someone growns in disgust], and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This--",michael
31597,My plan-- a man-- panama.,michael
31598,That's not how that goes.,andy
31600,"Thank you, Meredith.",jim
31603,"Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise? [all say yes] Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we're going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do.",michael
31606,What about a raise based on merit?,michael
31607,Rank each person individually?,jim
31608,"Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best.",michael
31609,"[sarcastically] Well, obviously. Too bad he's a temp and doesn't count, so let's get started. [starts to write on a piece of paper]",jim
31610,Are you making a--,michael
31611,Nope. I'm numbering the paper.,jim
31616,[out the side of his mouth] And Jim!,dwight
31618,I think it was Creed.,dwight
31620,"[to camera] It's going really well, actually.",jim
31621,"[to camera, holds up a bean] Each Boston Baked Bean represents half a percent raise. We each got 24 beans, so the idea is, you place the bean on the picture [walking around the table] of who you think deserv-- who's that? [picture that Michael drew of toby, looks like a monster]",jim
31622,Toby.,michael
31623,He's not a part of this. You know that.,jim
31624,Just wanted to draw a picture of him.,michael
31625,"Okay, your move.",jim
31626,Alright! Who to pick? [walking around the table] Who to pick?,michael
31627,Here we go.,jim
31628,I... will skip a turn.,michael
31629,"Okay, you're gonna still have to play that bean. You know that.",jim
31630,I need more time.,michael
31632,"People are starting to notice how terrible Jim is. It's great. Eventually, they'll rise up and revolt. My only hope is that they do it sooner rather than later. If the people here were our founding fathers, the Revolutionary War would have been delayed ten years, because Stanley Washington was napping, and Phyllis Hancock was still signing the declaration, and Kevin Jefferson was distracted by a butterfly.",dwight
31633,"Come on in. [everyone looking around at all the pictures and beans on the table]   That's right. Come in, feast your eyes. They determine our worth by putting beans upon our faces.",dwight
31635,Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager.,dwight
31636,"Hey, what are you guys doing in here?",michael
31638,"Why aren't there any beans on this very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?",pam
31640,Jim?,pam
31641,I was just trying to be unbiased.,jim
31647,"There's no way that Stanley gets more beans than me. [starts to take Stanley's beans, Stanley swats Andy's hand with his crossword puzzle] That is ridiculous. This is how it works. [everyone continues to argue]",andy
31649,"Thank you! That is exactly-- by the way, I would also like a raise.",andy
31651,"Are we idiots? [gets up, starts walking around] What right does Jim have to claim authority, hmm? Is he as good a salesman as I? Is he as matronly as Phyllis? There are moments where we can affect change. For a few seconds every decade, we exist, and these are those seconds! Let us storm his castle! Come on! Tick-- let's get him. Tock-- let's get Jim! Tick-- and drag Jim out of his office! Tock-- take his keys away from him! Tick-- that's a clock! The time is getting very close! It's now or never! What say you?!",dwight
31653,"No, I mean, what do you say to my plan? [all groan] Okay.",dwight
31654,"[leaving his office, hurrying to Jim's office]",michael
31656,[in Jim's office] How you doing?,michael
31657,"Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four.",jim
31658,"Oh, what are you usually?",michael
31659,Six. You?,jim
31660,"Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero.",michael
31661,"I mean, a performance-based raise sounded like a good idea, right?",jim
31662,"I know, I know.",michael
31663,We tried to find the fairest way to do it.,jim
31664,"Yes, we did.",michael
31665,I just-- what?,jim
31666,"Um, nothing. I just... I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you. [leaves office]",michael
31670,[to camera] Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?,jim
31672,[Michael give Jim a 'World's Best Boss' mug] Thank you.,jim
31673,You're welcome.,michael
31674,What's in here?,jim
31675,"Gin. [toast, sip]",michael
31676,Ooh!,jim
31677,[someone knocks] Just pretend we're not here.,michael
31679,"Yeah, I mean, if it's all the same for you.",pam
31681,$100 now for sure.,pam
31683,"Yeah. No, no, I'll um-- the hundred. I'll just take the hundred.",pam
31685,How sure is this?,pam
31686,The guy has an algorithm to determine the winner of any given college basketball game.,pam
31687,"I'm sorry. You guys have probably noticed my stomach's a little more sensitive lately. So, if you wouldn't mind wearing a little less perfume... and if your lunch is especially pungent, maybe have it in the break room?",pam
31688,We would really appreciate it.,jim
31689,Pam is constantly throwing up because of the pregnancy. If she eats something the fetus doesn't like she is screwed. It's amazing. A three ounce fetus is calling the shots. It's so bad ass.,dwight
31690,"Phyllis, if you could switch to a different soap, just for a month or two? Yours is kind of perfumy.",pam
31692,"Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.",dwight
31694,I don't think I'm asking for too much. I guess it's just the end of courtesy in the workplace.,pam
31695,"[Dwight peels a hard-boiled egg at his desk, sniffs it and takes a bite; Pam stares at him, picks up her trash can and pukes into it] Watching people get sick always makes me sick. And... frankly so does talking about it. So... wow...  [Andy, Phyllis, Meredith, Erin, Oscar and Angela all proceed to throw up in various places while Creed looks on eating a bowl of noodles; Dwight stares shocked; Pam wipes her mouth with a satisfied look]",andy
31696,[standing next to a car decorated for leaving a wedding] What do you think? I spent all morning on it.,michael
31697,It is really special.,jim
31698,"Yeah, but aren't you supposed to do that to our... no. It's great.",pam
31699,It's just a really important day for me.,michael
31700,"Well, congrats.",jim
31701,Thanks.,michael
31703,"Believe it or not, Kevin, fire crackers are in the don't column.",jim
31705,No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.,jim
31707,Come on. You've got to be kidding me.,dwight
31708,Ok. All of these things are important to remember but the most important thing is no one say anything about my pregnancy at the wedding.,pam
31709,Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.,jim
31711,"Well, we're thinking of my grandmother who we haven't told and is very old-fashioned.",pam
31713,That's nice.,jim
31714,"You know, Angela, you don't have to come to the wedding.",pam
31716,Yes she does. Yes she does. We're all gonna go and we're gonna have a good time. [hugs Angela],michael
31718,No.,michael
31719,Next time we're all in this room Jim and I will be married.,pam
31720,We'll see.,dwight
31721,"Thank you, Dwight.",pam
31722,Good-bye.,jim
31723,See you later. [others say good-bye],pam
31724,"And, hey, don't embarrass me when we go to Niagara.",michael
31725,"What happens in Niagara, stays in Niagara. [laughter]",andy
31726,Don't. Don't. Don't. You stole my joke. Don't steal my joke.,michael
31727,No... I didn't steal your joke.,andy
31728,Yes. I said that yesterday.,michael
31729,But you can say that about anything.,dwight
31730,Dwight...,michael
31731,"What happens in accounting, stays in accounting.",dwight
31733,"No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that's my joke.",michael
31734,It's easy. That's what I'm saying.,dwight
31735,"This is what I'm talking about. When we leave here and go up to Niagara Falls we are representing Dunder Mifflin, everyone. This is a very important wedding for the branch. The most important wedding until I get married. So, I want you all on your best behavior or so help me, God. So... I will see you up there in Viagra Falls!",michael
31736,Pam and Jim's wedding will be the single best pick up destination in the history of the universe.,michael
31737,I stole the guest list from Jim's desk and I search engined every female on both sides of the family.,dwight
31738,Get out of here.,michael
31739,Yes.,dwight
31740,"Oh, my God, Dwight.",michael
31741,"For instance, Pam's cousin, Jocelyn Webster.",dwight
31742,There's... a name.,michael
31743,Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.,dwight
31744,"Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn.",michael
31745,Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.,dwight
31746,Ok.,michael
31747,"She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.",dwight
31748,Is that all you have on her?,michael
31749,"Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.",dwight
31750,You're an idiot.,michael
31752,"[in Andy's car, Andy driving] Hey, do one of you guys want to sit up front with me so I have someone to talk to?  It's like a five hour drive-ish, you know.",andy
31754,Mmm-hmm. Erin?,andy
31756,Not only is Erin really sweet and cute... she smell's like my mom.,andy
31757,"[in car] Hey, my aunt told me something neat.",pam
31758,Yeah?,jim
31759,She said everything with the wedding goes by so fast we should try to take mental pictures of the high points.,pam
31760,"Oh, wow. That's cool.",jim
31761,Yeah.,pam
31762,"[aims imaginary camera at Pam] Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever.",jim
31763,Oh.,pam
31764,Lousy Picture.,jim
31765,We should have hired a professional to take our mental pictures.,pam
31766,"[in car, Michael driving] Oh! God! Wow! Oh. I was asleep.",michael
31767,What? No way!,dwight
31768,Those glasses are super dark.,michael
31769,Oh. God.,dwight
31770,"Alright. We need some tunes, I think.",michael
31771,You know what? I made you a cd...,dwight
31772,You did?,michael
31773,Mmm-hmm.,dwight
31774,That was nice of you.,michael
31775,This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.,dwight
31776,"Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in.",michael
31777,"You're gonna like this. [Dwight's voice on the cd] 'Hello. This is Dwight Schrute. If you are listening to this you are a lucky woman Michael has seduced. Ah to be in your shoes. 'What's next?', you're probably wondering. Don't be scared of you're night in heaven--' [Michael turns off cd]",dwight
31778,Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?,michael
31779,Yeah. It's practical.,dwight
31780,No. No. That's not how it works.,michael
31781,"Niagara Falls used to be, like, a spiritual experience for people. They stayed in tents and it blew their minds. It's really kitchy now, which is a lot of fun.",jim
31783,And Beesly. Tonight we're in two seperate rooms and tomorrow night is the honeymoon suite.,jim
31785,"I know. We're pretty excited, too.",jim
31786,Can we take a look at the suite now?,pam
31788,Oh... is there another wedding at the hotel this weekend?,pam
31790,Hey. I got the room the night before you guys. I'll break in the bed. [laughs],andy
31791,I don't like that.,jim
31792,"I'm gonna need the name and cell phone number of the housekeeper responsible for changing the sheets, please.",pam
31793,Hello. Reservation for Michael Scott.,michael
31795,The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.,dwight
31796,Mmm-hmm.,michael
31798,I don't have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms.,michael
31800,Dwight Schrute. I have a reservation. Confirmation number: Romeo. Tango. G7745.,dwight
31802,And I had spoken to Teresa about a room with two safes?,dwight
31804,Ok.,dwight
31806,"Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room.",michael
31807,No way. What if I meet someone?,dwight
31808,"I'm staying in your--  Come on, Dwight.",michael
31809,No. No.,dwight
31810,I would do the same for you.,michael
31811,You would?,dwight
31812,Yes.,michael
31813,Really?,dwight
31814,Yes... just go--,michael
31815,"Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours.",dwight
31816,Oh. Thank God.,michael
31817,"Oh no. Now that I don't have a room, can I stay with you?",dwight
31818,Um... no. And you know what? I would say yes but you can't. And I'll tell you why.,michael
31819,Please?,dwight
31820,"If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she's going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay.",michael
31821,Mmm-hmm.,dwight
31822,Ok.,michael
31823,Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha! [rips reservation out of Michael's hand] That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.,dwight
31824,I don't have a room?,michael
31825,No you do not.,dwight
31826,Ok. 'Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.',michael
31827,It worked.,dwight
31828,Jerk.,michael
31829,"When Mary was denied a room at the inn... Jesus was born. When Michael was denied a room at the inn, we don't know what happens because that story hasn't been told yet.",michael
31831,Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight?,michael
31833,Not in the same bed. In the other bed.,michael
31835,You... are... kidding me.,michael
31837,"I'm not a physics major, Stanley. I'm just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight?",michael
31840,That's rude.,michael
31842,"You are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it.",michael
31844,"Oh, Mema? She's the one in the teal suit. She's the only 80 year old with no smile wrinkles.",pam
31845,"Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?",jim
31847,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very conservative. So, mum's the word.",michael
31848,"Mom, Dad. This is Michael Scott.",jim
31850,How ya doin'?,michael
31852,Nice to meet you.,michael
31854,Who's doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and--,michael
31855,"Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think.",jim
31856,"[talking quietly, trying not to move his lips]That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.",michael
31857,Pretty sure everyone heard that.,jim
31858,Didn't move my lips.,michael
31859,"Hey, Mema.",pam
31861,Oh. Thank you... but nobody's perfect.,pam
31863,Mr. Beesly. How are ya?,jim
31865,"Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?",jim
31867,"From quarter three to quarter four up 17 percent, while his sales down two percent. It's all in the report.",dwight
31869,"Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt.",dwight
31871,That's right. It is ew. It is very ew.,dwight

31897,It's just for family.,dwight

31900,"What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight?",michael
31901,That's a very good record.,dwight
31907,"They have hilarious material and they are going to totally deliver it wrong. I would kill with the brother stuff. It should be me... up there. It should be me and Pete, not Pete and Tom.",michael
31912,"That's not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasn't gonna make a toast and I'm not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? 'I'm so smart. E=mc... squared. I drive a Smart Car.' That's not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider.",michael
31913,Knight Rider.,dwight
31914,That's a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.,michael
31915,No.,dwight
31916,"That's not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. [no one is laughing]",michael
31917,Very smart.,dwight
31918,And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesn't have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.,michael
31919,No.,jim
31920,Yeah. Go ahead.,michael
31921,"Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming.",jim
31923,"Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint. [laughter] Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?",jim
31924,Like... a year.,pam
31925,"I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So...  I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--",jim
31927,"Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant.",jim
31928,"[clears throat] Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that... they had an accident and you know what? These two people, they're living together, they're having lots of consentual sex--",michael
31930,"Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can't expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it's just a different sensation.",michael
31931,Michael.,jim
31932,"When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say it's not different, but it's a different sensation.",michael
31933,"Oh, my God. Please.",jim
31934,When you use something to block-- I think everybody knows what I am talking about. It's not necessarily different for the woman--,michael
31935,Michael.,pam
31936,...but it's different for the-- ok. Ok.,michael
31937,Michael. Stop.,pam
31938,"Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word.",michael
31939,Alright.,jim
31940,Jim.,michael
31941,To waiting.,jim
31944,Mema.,pam
31945,That was a little touch and go at first but I think we saved it.,michael
31946,I can't believe it was me.,jim
31947,"I know. I can't believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me.",michael
31948,Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?,jim
31949,I have not found that to be the case.,michael
31950,"Hey, smooth guys.",pam
31951,I'm so sorry.,jim
31952,"Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me.",michael
31953,Mema's not coming to the wedding. She's leaving tomorrow morning.,pam
31954,"Oh, my God. Are you serious?",jim
31955,There's gonna be a free room?,michael
31956,"Hi, Mema. It's Michael.",michael
31958,Yes. Yep. One in the same. May I?,michael
31959,"I am actually great with old women. In fact, for the longest time, my best friend was my grandma... and then she met Harriet and now she thinks she's better than everybody.",michael
31961,"Oh. Ok. Well... hook you up, there. [turns off tv]",michael
31963,You're welcome.,michael
31965,"Oh. Isn't he terrible? May I? Here's the thing. Umm... Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. It's not 1890 anymore. It's modern day. And women have sex before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. That's part of life.",michael
31967,Exactly.,michael
31969,I know.,michael
31971,"They're gonna name the baby after you, you know. They're gonna call it Mema.",michael
31973,"Yes, and if it's a boy they will call it Sylvio.",michael

31988,Yeah.,pam
31990,No.,pam
31991,What are you wearing?,michael
31992,"What? It's a casual, social outfit.",dwight
31993,"Looks like you're going to a fish fry, Dwight.",michael
31994,No. They're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women because of the howling during sex.,dwight
31995,"Ok. [Dwight howls] That's not appropriate. [Dwight continues howling] Uncool. Uncool, Dwight. [they both howl] Ok. Ok. Come on. Let's go. [both howl as they exit]",michael
31999,"I'm just worried about the farm, ya know? Mose hates to geld the horses by himself.",dwight
32000,"Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. It's not relatable. Nobody owns a farm.",michael
32002,Nine and three-quarters.,dwight

32018,How about a little bit of this.,andy
32021,Did someone change my name to Baskin Robbin? Because I feel like a banana split. Woo! [Andy does a split and screams out in pain],andy
32024,I was dancing and I did a split and I landed on my car keys in my pocket.,andy
32025,What?,pam
32026,I tore my scrotum. I need you to take me to the hospital.,andy

32064,I was trying to liven things up a little bit.  I was kinda doing your job so--,andy
32065,My job?  My job is to get married in the morning.  That's my job.,pam

32067,"[Pam swerves the car back and forth] Ow, ow!",andy
32068,[snickers] I spent the night with the bride the night before the wedding.  Ah yeah.  She stepped on my hand on her way to the bathroom.,andy

32070,No.  No that was real.,andy

32087,[walking out of hotel room with a woman] You have everything?,dwight
32089,Cell phone?  Charger?,dwight
32091,"It really is.  I'm not hungry.  I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep.  And besides, I wouldn't want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding.  She needs you Isabel.",dwight

32095,"Okay, get out of here.",dwight
32097,Okay.,dwight

32103,"Hey, what was she like?",dwight
32104,She was cute.  You know?  She was hot.  She was very hot.  She made love like a tiger.,michael

32113,No.,dwight
32114,She's Pam's best friend.  You guys could double date.  Swap maybe?,michael
32115,Oh please.  Put a gun in my mouth.,dwight
32116,No... you're crazy.,michael
32117,Look.  She's a dental hygienist from Carbondale and she makes love like one.  She's a bumpkin.  Pass.,dwight
32118,She's-- okay.  Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist?  You have to take x-rays.  You have to scrape the plaque off of people's teeth.  You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they're not scared when the dentist comes in.  It-- it--,michael
32119,You should ask her out.,dwight
32120,[stands up and walks away]  I already have my European girlfriend.,michael
32127,Oh cause of last night?  No way.  Reports have been exaggerated.  Weddings make me very emotional.  I um--I just have that side to me.,andy
32129,Well that's not--,andy
32131,I wasn't telling you.,andy
32133,Excuse me?,andy
32135,"No, it didn't--nothing got torn off.  Who told you that?",andy

32138,"It was my scrotum.  Um, and it was.  Thank you.",andy
32139,"Oh, here we go.  They asked for cash, but you know... I give them cash every week, so-- how much cash does a person need?  I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special.  I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory.  [holds up painting]  And I have another one of them in the nude.  But that one is for me.",michael
32140,"I got them a set of turtle boiling pots, a shell hammer and bibs.",dwight

32158,[talking to a woman] That was an intelligent comment.,dwight
32160,"Oh.  Fine.  Isabel, [holds out hand] nice to see you.  What do you want?",dwight

32168,Terrible.,pam
32169,So beautiful. [Pam's starts to cry.  Jim pulls up chair to sit next to her] Hey--,jim

32171,"[takes her hand] Hey.  You look just as I imagined you would.  Pam, you're so pretty.",jim
32172,[sighs] Thank you.,pam
32173,"And who cares?  It's a stupid veil, right?",jim
32174,"No, this was the one thing I was supposed to be able to control, was this veil and-- [Jim cuts off half his tie]",pam
32175,"There.  Now we're even.  [Pam laughs and mimes taking a picture, they kiss]",jim
32176,[sighs] Everyone's driving me crazy.  I know way too much about Andy's scrotum.  [Jim chuckles] And my mom won't stop freaking out about my dad's new girlfriend.  [sighs] This is supposed to be our wedding day.  Why did we invite all these people?,pam
32183,[to Pam's mom] Hey.  Hi.  Do you--would you have a snack in your purse?  You're a mom.  I just figured you might have--,michael

32192,my weekend was bad so far.,michael

32236,Saw it.,pam
32237,"I bought those boat tickets the day I saw that You Tube video.  I knew we'd need a back-up plan.  The boat was actually Plan C.  The church was Plan B and Plan A was marrying her a long, long time ago.  Pretty much the day I met her.",jim

32346,He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported.,dwight
32347,All right.,michael
32348,"Not only that, but if they find out you snitched, you get a dead horses chopped off head in your bed!",andy
32349,Shh!,michael
32350,You know what?,dwight
32351,That's not gonna happen.,michael
32352,That's an exaggeration.,dwight
32353,That's how it works!,andy
32354,What am I supposed to do here?,michael
32355,"When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back",andy
32356,I was thinking exactly the same thing.,michael
32357,"No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat.",dwight
32358,Dwight...,andy
32359,"The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.",dwight
32360,"I don't know, I don't know about that.",michael
32361,"Wait let's hear him out, this is interesting.",andy
32362,"Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent.",dwight
32363,Okay.,andy
32364,Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.,dwight
32365,[snaps fingers] I like this plan. I'd like to officially withdraw my plan.,andy
32366,"Hold on, hold on! Just-",michael
32367,"No, no, no. My plan is out! We do this the hard way.",andy
32368,"All right. I will meet with him, but I'm not going alone.",michael
32369,Well you're gonna have to. [overlaps] Dwight: We'll be right beside you.,andy
32370,What?,andy
32371,"[Andy dressed as a mechanic, Cornell hat on] What are you wearing? Who's Pat?",michael
32372,"Well if I'm gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I'm a mechanic with a tire thing.",andy
32373,Do you know how to use it?,dwight
32374,"To change tires, no. But it's metal, I can hit somebody with it.",andy
32375,"Let's go, come on. [whispers] God!",michael
32376,Should I change?,andy
32377,You're wearing loafers!,dwight
32378,Forget it! Forget it!,michael
32379,[Andy is playing with the tire iron] Take that thing off the table! Please!,michael
32380,Well then I can't use it. I'm just gonna hide it.,andy
32381,Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.,dwight
32382,Oh! God! [smacks roaches],andy
32383,Oh my God!,michael
32384,You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-,dwight
32385,"Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is.",michael
32386,Hello.,michael
32388,Mr. Grotti we meet again. These are my associates.,michael
32390,Hi.,andy
32391,Hello.,dwight
32393,Yes.,michael
32395,Well.,michael
32398,Okay.,michael
32415,Oh he's not that nice.,dwight
32416,That's not true.,michael
32417,Hmm. Very true.,andy
32418,Okay shut up.,michael
32422,I will have the gabba-gool.,michael
32424,The gabba-gool.,michael
32426,"[with Soprano's inflection] You know, gabba-gool.",andy
32427,"I don't, I don't have to have that.",michael
32428,"What he's trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.",dwight
32429,"Guys, guys-",michael
32431,That's okay.,michael
32432,Bring him the gabba-gool!,dwight
32433,"Shh. I will have the spaghetti, with a side salad.",michael
32435,"If the salad is on top, I send it back.",michael
32444,I don't think our company actually needs any more insurance. So I am out.,michael
32446,Maybe we have a plan for you?,andy
32449,Yeeeeah.,andy
32451,Yes I can.,andy
32452,"No, no no, no. Come on. I'm sorry, we're having our salad.",michael
32454,Okay!,andy
32456,"Hey, do you need any help?",michael
32458,He's a good mechanic.,michael
32460,I don't...,michael
32461,He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.,dwight
32462,"Okay, okay okay.",michael
32463,So we're choosing...,dwight
32464,"Yep, all right.",michael
32465,Check out Dental?,dwight
32466,Put it down.,michael
32467,"Black goes on the red. With the... If we... Positive... Mo- it being a motor drive, it's probably down.",andy
32469,"You want to do this junior? I didn't think so. Sorry. It's kind of a long day at the... mechanic store. [Andy places connections wrong, smoke and explosion set off] Aaaah!  You got a leaky spark tube.",andy
32471,"So your car's totaled. Uh, you're just gonna want to get a refund on that. Or my guy could do it. He's great. But uh, I can't do that for you. I work exclusively on motorcycles. [Andy walks away, woman is exasperated]",andy
32473,"Yeah. Just thinking about how, uh, I had this car, this Italian car, and I was driving it, and it kept telling me how much it needed oil, but I wouldn't give it any oil. And then, one day it exploded and it killed everyone and that's what I'm afraid of.",andy
32475,"It was before, my tech- my technical training.",andy
32476,Don't do it!,dwight
32477,Do it.,andy
32478,Don't.,dwight
32479,Just do it.,andy
32480,Okay.,michael
32482,Yes.,dwight
32483,Okay.,michael
32484,"I don't understand, why would you buy a policy?",dwight
32485,It's just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.,michael
32486,"You were man enough to back down Michael, I'm proud of you.",andy
32487,I had to make a snap decision Dwight.,michael
32488,"It wasn't a snap decision, you were sitting there for an hour.",dwight
32489,It was a lot of snap decisions.,michael
32490,Do you know what 'snap decision' means?,dwight
32491,Yes!,michael
32492,It means like this. [snaps fingers],dwight
32493,Just get in the car.,michael
32494,Hello?,jim
32495,Jim?,michael
32496,Michael?,jim
32497,Oh thank God.,michael
32498,"How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran.",jim
32499,"It wasn't easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I'm in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier.",michael
32500,That sounds bad.,jim
32501,"Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I'm turning to you my friend.",michael
32502,I'm gonna help you through it all right?,jim
32503,Okay!,michael
32504,All you're gonna need to [faking a bad connection] and-  it- and then go to--,jim
32505,Jim? Are you?,michael
32506,And then you'll be saved.,jim
32507,"What? Wait, I didn't hear a thing you just said.",michael
32508,Just [drops] and then you'll be saved.,jim
32509,"No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again!",michael
32510,A- ah--,jim
32511,No!  Oh my God!,michael
32512,And you'll be saved.,jim
32513,"No, Jim please, repeat what you're saying! I can't understand you!",michael
32514,I [drops out] at the Bermuda Triangle. An-  M-  please don't call again.,jim
32515,Jim?!? [dial tone] Oh my God.,michael
32516,"Hey uh, question for you. I recently purchased some insurance that I can't afford given my present salary. Is there anything accounting-wise I can do to sort of make it all go away?",michael
32518,Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing?,michael
32520,"All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks.",michael
32521,"We have let Michael down, and it's 85 percent your fault.",dwight
32522,He's alive.  So you're welcome.,andy
32523,"Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.",dwight
32524,"Yeah, some of that existed before.",andy
32525,"Not the living in fear, that's new.",dwight
32526,"You're right, that is new.",andy
32527,Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy.,dwight
32528,Well I don't see that happening.,andy
32529,Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy?,dwight
32530,Are you saying-,andy
32531,Yeah...,dwight
32532,That we surgically remove the fear center from Michael's brain?,andy
32533,What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia!,dwight
32534,That seems a little far-fetched.,andy
32535,Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown?  And that happened.,dwight
32536,Michael. Incredible news. Grotti is clean.,dwight
32537,No. He's not. He's just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still don't understand how this works.,michael
32538,"No, Michael. What we're trying to say is, we made a mistake assuming he was mafia. I have a buddy who's a Fed, and we did a background check on the guy.  His background is perfectly clean.",andy
32539,"It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.",dwight
32540,Class act. Boy scout.,andy
32541,But Grotti acts like he's mafia though.,michael
32542,He's trying to intimidate you to close sales. He's just a pushy salesman.,andy
32543,And he made us all look like chumps!,dwight
32544,[grunts],michael
32545,"If there is one thing I hate more than the mafia it is a liar. I wish the mafia would go out and kill all the liars. Bury them in my yard. And I wouldn't tell the cops a thing. Not that I would be lying per se. But I would just get really quiet, all of a sudden.",michael
32547,This is Scott.,michael
32549,Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me?,michael
32551,Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I'm actually kind of PO'd.,michael
32553,"I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance.",michael
32555,I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk.,michael
32556,Whoa. Okay.,andy
32557,You suck!,michael
32558,Okay that's-,dwight
32559,And I'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance.,michael
32560,"That's good, let's wrap it up.",dwight
32561,"How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it?",michael
32563,Doubt it. [disconnects call],michael
32565,What a tool. [Dwight and Andy exchange looks] What?,michael
32566,"Next time you look in the mirror, you're gonna be looking at a guy who stood down the mafia!",andy
32567,No. What do you mean?,michael
32568,"We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared.",dwight
32569,What?,michael
32570,You successfully backed down the mob!,dwight
32571,You made the mafia apologize to you! You made the mafia be polite!,andy
32572,Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But I'm not.,michael
32573,"So I looked him in the eye and I said, 'Not today Grotti, Not today. And not tomorrow, and not the next day. Or the day after that. And you can tell all your friends that if I see them, then they're already dead.' I said something like that.",michael
32574,Very close.,dwight
32576,Erin?,michael
32578,Coffee?,michael
32580,"Not from the kitchen. Stop and Shop. If it's not Stop and Shop, I send it back.",michael
32582,Large. If it's a medium I send it back. If it's an extra large I send it back.,michael
32584,Go.  Any questions?,michael
32585,[on phone] Are you kidding me?,pam
32587,"Listen our credit card has been cancelled and we have to deal with that, and I really can't handle the fact that you're calling us here!",pam
32589,Oh I will. I will Kevin. I will make that my top priority.,pam
32595,It was.,jim
32596,It really was.,pam
32597,Really was.,jim
32599,Puerto Rico was awesome.,jim
32600,"Oh my gosh. The honeymoon was great. We met this other couple at the resort, Frank and Benny. We hung out with them a lot.",pam
32601,[goofy voice] Frank and Beans. [laughs] Always makes her laugh.,jim
32602,[goofy voice] Frank and beans!,pam
32603,"Is there someone there? Who is there? I hear voices, is somebody there?",michael
32604,Yeah!,dwight
32605,Is someone there? I can't see you because I'm blind.,michael
32606,"Its Jim and Pam, Michael.",dwight
32607,[gasps] It is?,michael
32608,Yeah...,dwight
32609,"They're back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam! [reaching out with hands at chest level]",michael
32610,Nope.,jim
32611,"And oh, Jim...",michael
32612,"Hi, Michael.",pam
32613,"Oh, I haven't see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy.",michael
32614,Blind-guy McSqueezy. How do I describe it? It is a character I've been workshopping whose lack of vision gets him into all sorts of trouble. The women in my improve class absolutely hate him. [groans],michael
32616,Some candy.,pam
32618,That's it.,pam
32620,"[behind Pam, acting out blind-guy, groaning]",michael
32621,It's good to be home.,pam
32622,This conversation has two items on the agenda.,dwight
32623,Do we have a conversation scheduled?,jim
32624,"Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say... [high voice, holding up wooden mallard] con-quack-ulations!",dwight
32625,"Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you.",jim
32626,"[duck voice] You're welcome! [quacks, laughs]",dwight
32627,"I inserted a listening device into the belly of the mallard. Now I can observe Jim, trap Jim, and destroy Jim, just like in the Bavarian fairy tale. Only this time, the mallard skins the toad alive. And of course in this version you lose the whole veiled critique of the Kaiser thing.",dwight
32628,I'm sorry to have been bugging you all these years.,dwight
32629,It's a real handsome duck.,jim
32630,"Mallard. Okay, I'll get out of your hair.",dwight
32631,Hey!,pam
32633,"Uh, we brought back some Puerto Rican candy.",pam
32635,Awesome! I'll leave it up here so everyone can enjoy it.,pam
32637,[laughs] I think it'll be okay.,pam
32639,Great.,pam
32641,I have recently taken a lover.,michael
32642,"Well, that's great. Congratulations. Who's the lucky lady?",jim
32643,Pam's mom.,michael
32644,What?,jim
32645,"Pam's mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding?",michael
32646,You're messing with me.,jim
32647,About what?,michael
32648,You did not have sex with Pam's mom.,jim
32649,"Oh, big time.",michael
32650,What kind of car does she drive?,jim
32651,She drives a green camry.,michael
32652,[expletive],jim
32653,And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.,michael
32654,Oh my God. [Michael bangs the table] Oh my God.,jim
32655,[laughs] What?,michael
32656,"Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-",jim
32657,"Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright?",michael
32658,Oh my God.,jim
32660,"Not now, Toby, my God!",jim
32662,"Get the hell out of here, idiot.",michael
32664,"Okay, as far as dinner tonight, cancel that, and please, for both our sakes, never, ever, ever see her again.",jim
32665,"I think you're underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.",michael
32666,"No, not more than anything.",jim
32667,"Okay, I have a good thing with the mom-",michael
32668,Don't call her 'the mom.',jim
32669,She's right on my way home from work.,michael
32670,"Then take a different way home, man!",jim
32671,"I di- alright, I'll take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam.",michael
32672,"Okay, so we're good.",jim
32673,Yeah.,michael
32674,Can you change my dinner reservations from four people to two?,michael
32676,Sure. Thanks for asking.,michael
32678,Frank and beans!,jim
32679,"Frank and beans! [both laugh] So what'd we decide for Michael, the bottle of rum, or the seashell alarm clock?",pam
32680,You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?,jim
32681,"Bottle of rum it is. [takes package out of bag] Alright, shall we?",pam
32682,"You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy.",jim
32683,"Come on, it'll take two seconds.",pam
32684,"No, it- [high-pitched feedback as Jim starts to leave, feedback changes as he moves, turns over the mallard to see the listening devics, sighs, places mallard back on the desk]",jim
32685,"[unwraps rum gift] Oh, wow.",michael
32686,[giggles],pam
32687,That is amazing. I feel like a real Puerto Rican.,michael
32689,"Erin, look. [holds up parrot rum bottle]",michael
32691,Yeah.,michael
32692,"Wow, Botticelli's, that sounds like a special occasion.",pam
32693,"Yeah, no, it's nobody.",michael
32694,[laughs] I don't know. I think Michael has a date.,pam
32695,[chuckles] Hmm... no.,michael
32696,[laughs] I think you have a date.,pam
32697,I don't.,michael
32698,Come on.,pam
32699,"Uh, I think we should just drop it... 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it.",jim
32700,"[sighs] I don't deserve this, guys.",michael
32701,"Yes, you do.",jim
32702,"No, I don't.",michael
32703,Just take the parrot.,jim
32704,[long exhale],michael
32705,"Okay, back to the old grind.",jim
32706,I was probably going to break up with her anyway.,michael
32707,"Oh, that's too bad.",pam
32708,Don't-,jim
32709,"Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here.",michael
32710,Sounds complicated.,jim
32711,It is.,michael
32712,"Yeah, but I mean, if you really like this person, then you should see where it goes.",pam
32713,You want me to be happy?,michael
32714,Of course.,pam
32715,"Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine.",michael
32716,Oh.,pam
32717,"More than a friend, a co-worker.",michael
32718,"Oh! Gossip, who is it? Who is it? Who is it, Michael? ...Who?",pam
32719,It's okay.,michael
32720,"No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Nooooo!",pam
32721,"That could have gone one of two ways, but I never expected her to get upset.",michael
32722,"[screams out in the parking lot, Michael watches from his office window]",pam
32723,"[to Michael] You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?",dwight
32724,Okay.,michael
32725,"There's an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down...",dwight
32726,[sighs] Feels good.,michael
32727,There's a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down...,dwight
32728,"I'm sleeping with Pam's mom. Sometimes, dinner.",michael
32729,"...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine.",dwight
32730,"[outside, on cell phone] How could you do this to me? He's my boss! How many times have I complained about him to you? No, I am not being dramatic, you are being crazy!",pam
32731,[singsong voice] Who wants a hot chocolate?,jim
32732,Thank you.,pam
32733,"[sighs] Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.",jim
32734,You need to be more upset about this. She's your mother too now. Your mother is sleeping with Michael Scott.,pam
32735,"Andy, can I talk to you for a second?",jim
32736,"Sure thing, Tuna Boss.",andy
32737,"[holding up a sign that reads, 'Dwight picked the wrong day to put a wooden mallard in my office']",jim
32738,[in Jim's office] How may I be of service to you?,andy
32739,"I am gonna need your advice [starts playing loud opera music, everyone can hear it, Creed starts crying] I was thinking about getting this opera for Dwight's birthday, what do you think?",jim
32740,"[both look at Dwight, Jim waves] This aurea is a joke.",andy
32741,Really?,jim
32742,What are you thinking?,andy
32743,I was gonna go with this one.,jim
32744,"[both look at Dwight who is standing right outside the office] Let me tell you something, if you respect him at all, you will get him something better.",andy
32745,[Andy gets up and leaves the office] The Nard Dog... what was that all about?,dwight
32746,"I know, right?",andy
32747,What were you talking about in there?,dwight
32748,"Trust me it would only make you mad.  [opera continues, Dwight looks at Jim standing outside his office, waves, Jim waves back]",andy
32749,"[in the conference room leading a meeting] Due to a certain recent incident, corporate has asked all the branches to come up with ideas as to how we can better communicate with our communities.",michael
32750,Is this because of the 60 Minutes segment about working conditions in our Peruvian paper mill?,andy
32751,"That was a hit job.  If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster.  So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I'm not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own.",michael
32752,Haha!  Ha ha ha.,pam
32753,And whoever comes up with the best idea gets a $50 gift certificate to the restaurant of his or her choice.  [everyone claps and makes comments],jim
32754,"Who wants to help the world one step at a time?  [Dwight raises his hand] Alright, good.",michael
32755,Volunteerism is important.  Every weekend I volunteer at the local animal shelter and they need a lot of help down there.  Last Sunday I had to put down over 150 pets all by myself.,dwight

32758,Alright...,michael
32759,"I have a way to make Scranton a better place, you could leave it.  [laughter]",pam

32763,"I love it, conservation.  Let's start by conserving our time and stop having these stupid meetings.   [stands up and cheers]  No more meetings!  No more meetings! No more meetings!  No more meetings!  [Stanley cheers her on in the background]",pam

32766,Yes!  Angela!  Please...,jim
32767,[Michael leaves to answer his phone] Can you hold down the fort?   [on phone] Hey boo!,michael

33209,[laughing] He's alright.,jim
33210,"No. He's a- yeah, he's alright. Ok. [holds door open as they exit]",michael
33211,Thanks Michael.,jim
33212,You're welcome. Whoa! [leans back] Almost fell. [they both laugh],michael
33213,"Hey, Erin. Do you mind faxing this for me?",pam
33215,Ok.,pam
33217,Mmm-hmm.,pam
33219,"No. It was a total waste of time. Um... it was fun, though, because I got to spend the day with Andy Bernard. He's really cool.",pam
33221,"Yeah, he is.",pam
33223,That's... right. He's like Marlon Brando.,pam
33225,I actually do mean Marlon Wayan. Yeah.,pam
33226,Good morning everybody.  Who would like an authentic New York bagel?  Hmmm?  Stanley?,dwight
33228,"No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you.",dwight
33229,Wow. H & H.  You went all the way to New York City to get us bagels?,andy
33230,"Oh, why? Is there a place closer that sells them?",dwight
33232,Thanks.,andy
33233,"Oh, don't mention it.  You owe me one.  You all owe me one.",dwight
33234,Good morning Michael.,dwight
33235,Morning Dwight.,michael
33236,Hungry?,dwight
33237,No.  I had a fish stick sandwich.  Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches.  My girlfriend didn't want hers.  Because I guess I'm the only aphrodisiac she needs.,michael
33238,Fish sticks are not an aphrodisiac.,dwight
33239,"Well, yeah...",michael
33240,You're thinking of deer penis.,dwight
33241,It worked.,michael
33242,Regardless.  That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry.  [holds up tray] Bagel?,dwight
33243,I don't mind if I do.,michael
33244,K. I brought cheese too.,dwight
33245,I'm taking one for my lady friend.,michael
33246,Excellent.,dwight
33247,Brain food. Thank you very much.,michael
33248,Okay. [walks out of Michael's office] You owe me.,dwight
33249,Can't a guy just buy some bagels for his friends so they'll owe him a favor which he can use to get someone fired who stole a co-manager position from him anymore?  Geez.  When did everyone get so cynical?,dwight
33250,"Pam, would you care for a bagel?",dwight
33251,"Oh, no thank you.",pam
33252,"That's right.  You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time.  I'll try again.  Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.",dwight
33253,I have an early lunch.,pam
33254,"Michael's been trying to get Jim and me to hang out ever since he started dating my mom.  I don't know.  I really hoped this thing would just die out, but today he's planning a birthday lunch for my mom and we have to go.  No way out.  No way out.",pam
33260,Hey!  [gets up to greet Helene] Hey. Happy birthday.,pam
33262,[comes over to hug them both] My girls.  There they are. [Pam walks away],michael
33263,"Birthday lunch.  Birthday lunch-- there is no better medicine than birthday lunch.  It'll cure all of your 'Gee I don't know if Michael should be dating my mother' and fixes all occurrences of 'I don't really see them together'.  So, open wide Pam and take a big old spoonful of birthday lunch medicine.  Take with food.",michael
33265,I think you guys all remember my mom from the wedding.,pam
33266,Yeah--,michael
33268,I think everyone has meet Helene.  Shall we?,michael
33272,"No, that wouldn't be--",michael
33274,Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to-- inappropriosity.,michael
33276,Hey--,michael
33277,Kevin!,pam
33278,"Please, Kevin.  You're fired.  [Kevin looks at Jim; Jim shakes his head]  Sorry, sorry.  Work with a bunch of idiots.  Shall we go?",michael
33279,"Yes, let's go. [looks at Erin and nods]",pam
33281,"Oh, you guys.  Just one second.  [picks up phone] Oh my gosh!  Are you serious?  Shipping emergency.  I don't think I can go to lunch.",pam
33282,"Oh man, that's crazy.  Right as we were on our way out too.",jim
33283,I know.  Isn't that always how it goes?,pam
33284,Rarely.  If ever.  Let me give it a whirl.  I'll talk to them.,jim
33285,I want to handle it.,pam
33286,That's okay.,jim
33287,I feel like its--,pam
33288,It's my pleasure. [takes phone from Pam] Hello?  Well that's great. [hangs up phone]  Turns out the paper was there all along.,jim
33292,Yeah-- it's exciting.,pam
33294,Pam's sales are fine actually.,jim
33295,"Just want you to succeed Pammy.  You know what, we shouldn't even be talking about business today.",michael
33296,Thank you.,pam
33297,Today is about family.,michael
33298,Why did I get in the car?  I could of struggled.  I have a whistle in my purse I didn't even blow it.,pam
33299,"Oh, Dwight.  I have a little surprise for you.",andy
33300,Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.,dwight
33301,"Yes! [they laugh] And I wanted to return the favor.  I was polishing my loafers and I happened to look over and noticed that your brief case was a little worse for the wear, so a little elbow grease and she's polished right up, back up to her former glory.",andy
33302,Wow--,dwight
33303,Feel it against your cheek.,andy
33304,I will.  [Andy rubs the briefcase against Dwight's face],dwight
33305,You give me a gift-- Bam!  Thank you note.  You invite me somewhere-- Pow! RSVP.  You do me a favor-- Wham!  Favor returned.  Do not test my politeness.,andy
33306,Let me get that door for you--  [runs to open door],dwight
33307,Whoa--,andy
33308,There you go!,dwight
33309,Thank you very much.  Now I've got it for you. [holds open door],andy
33310,"Oh... goodness... thanks.  You know, here's a healthy fitness tip.  If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.",dwight
33311,Is that right?,andy
33312,Observe. [walks towards desk],dwight
33313,Huh. [laughs; follows Dwight],andy
33314,Right?,dwight
33315,That really works.,andy
33316,"Yeah, feel free to use that.  Anytime.  Okay.",dwight
33317,"Hey-- oh, hold on a second.  Do not walk around with your jacket cattywampus.",andy
33318,[straightens Andy's tie]  And that needs to be straight as an arrow.,dwight
33319,Whoa--  thank you very much.  [takes off Dwight's glasses and blows on them]  Oh boy.,andy
33320,Thank you very much for that.,dwight
33321,[puts Dwight's glasses back on Dwight's face]  You are very welcome.,andy
33322,[pulls out Andy's chair] Have a seat.  Allow me.,dwight
33323,[pulls out Dwight's chair] Have a seat yourself.,andy
33324,You know what?  I am going to preemptively change the batteries in your wireless mouse.,dwight
33325,Not necessary.,andy
33326,"No, no, no! [takes mouse and runs away]",dwight
33327,You didn't have to do that.,andy
33328,Andy is complicating things.  But I'm not worried.  This will only up my game.,dwight
33329,Hello.  Scott.  Table for four.,michael
33331,"I use to love coming here.  The chicken parm is good.  Big part of my childhood.  Oh, maybe Michael will start dating that too.",pam
33332,What table should we take?  So many to choose from.,michael
33333,Wow.,jim
33335,"What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations.  Oh, wait a second!  You mean this one?  Wow!",michael
33336,"Michael, you did all this?",pam
33337,Not about taking credit.  Let's just say we all did it.,michael
33339,"Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place.  Really makes me want to go to Italy some day.",michael
33341,Oh. Thank you.  Thanks for lending me the books.,michael
33342,"So, mom... which birthday are we celebrating this year?",pam
33344,49 again? That's nine years in a row.  This is now our longest family tradition.,pam
33345,That's funny.,michael
33347,"Oh, burn.  Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too. [they laugh]",jim
33348,You're 54 years old.,michael
33350,You're 58 years old?,michael
33352,Congratulations.,michael
33353,The only time you should care about a woman's age is if she is too young for you and I am not robbing the cradle.  If anything I am robbing the grave.,michael
33354,"Mom, have you decided what you want to be called?",pam
33356,Please be Grandma.,pam
33357,Definitely Grandma.,jim
33358,I want you to be Grandma.,pam
33360,[nods uncomfortably] That--,michael
33361,"Yay, Grandma!",pam
33362,"Hey, would you guys ever do a triathlon, do you think?",michael
33363,Maybe.,pam
33364,Helene?,michael
33366,"I am.  I'm definitely going to do it.  I've already got the run and the bike thing down.  Just need to learn how to swim.  Come on, you in?",michael
33368,"So it's a matter of interest.  Good, okay.  It's not anything you would have ever done.",michael
33370,Well there's no jumping in a triathlon.,michael
33372,You're thinking of the broad jump.  Would you try-- bungee jumping?,michael
33374,Snowboarding?,michael
33376,I might.,michael
33378,[sighs] Nothing.  Just life-- and doing things-- before you die. I don't know.,michael
33379,Do I really want to go snowboarding?  No.  But I would like to if I wanted to.,michael
33380,[singing fanfare] Aye-yi-yi! [lifts covers off trays of food],andy
33381,What's going on in here?,dwight
33383,Oh... no... really?,dwight
33384,"Yep, yep.  Took a page right out of the old Schrute book of niceness.",andy
33385,There is no book.  There's only a survival guide.,dwight
33386,"You bought breakfast for everyone, so I got lunch for everyone.",andy
33387,"Okay, well, allow me.  You know what-- gosh these tacos are awfully complicated to make.  I will make everyone's tacos! Gra-ga-ga-ga-ga!",dwight
33388,So we should get the check?,michael
33389,What about your gift Michael?,pam
33390,"Oh, no, no, no. No.  It's stupid.  You'd hate it.  I hate it.",michael
33392,Yes you will.,michael
33393,He locked himself in his office all morning working on it.,pam
33395,Aww--,pam
33396,I literally-- I put no thought into the wrapping at all.  Might as well of been toilet paper.,michael
33398,That's just an arbitrary title.,michael
33400,Penny for your thoughts.,jim
33402,Wow.,jim
33403,That's amazing.,pam
33404,"It's not amazing... at all.  It's sort of weird that I went and did that.  And now your wish won't come true, so that blows.",michael
33406,Oh that I plagiarized I think.,michael
33408,[whispers to Pam] Shel Silverstein.,jim
33409,Yeah.,pam
33411,That's really nice Michael.,pam
33412,I think it sucks.,michael
33414,"Well, that's because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things.  It's a generational-- sort of gap between us.",michael
33416,Home run Michael.,pam
33417,You set the bar so high.,jim
33418,That was a bunt.,michael
33419,"Whoa, whoa Dwight.  I'm going to do this.",andy
33420,"Hey, hey, hey--  relax I got it covered.",dwight
33421,"No, I insist.",andy
33422,"No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist.   [pushes Andy out of the room and locks the door]",dwight
33423,"Ok, Dwight this is ridiculous.",andy
33424,Don't worry about it.  You can just owe me.,dwight
33425,Hey. Where'd you go?,pam
33426,"Oh, just went to the bathroom.",michael
33427,And then you stopped at the bar on the way back?,pam
33428,I got thirsty.,michael
33429,"Okay, weirdo.  Come on.  It's time for cake.",pam
33430,"Honestly, for a long time I thought I was going to grow old with Holly.  And then I met Helene.  And she is great and she already knows and has done everything  that I have ever wanted to do and can tell me about it.  But, I think I want to do those things myself.",michael
33431,Cakes really good.,pam
33433,"Finish your cake, Helene.",michael
33435,"I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible  I need to tell you.  I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing.",michael
33436,"Helene I think you're a wonderful person and I-- God-- I've enjoyed dating you and being your boyfriend so much.  But I have to consider Pam's feelings as a friend and a co-worker I can not in good conscience continue to date you, when I know what this is doing to her.",michael
33437,"Michael.  Michael ,it's okay.",pam
33438,No it's not.,michael
33439,"I know that it took me a little while to come around and its still a little weird to get used to, but you obviously make my mom very happy.  And that makes me happy.",pam
33440,Wow.  That just-- you've really grown.,michael
33441,Well--,pam
33442,"[covering eyes] Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part.  Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it.  And I want it someday, but just in the future.  You need somebody who-- who understands your references.  Who is Kafkaesque?  I've never-- I don't know him.  There's another woman.  And her name is Italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping.",michael
33443,"Okay, so--",jim
33444,"And I want kids.  And you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.",michael
33445,Michael.,pam
33446,It's not my decision.  It's mother nature.  And mother has very strict rules about fer--  [waitress comes over to pour water; long pause] -- tility.,michael
33449,"Well, hobbies--",michael
33450,Stop.,jim
33451,[reaching for something on the top shelf]  Ahh.,andy
33452,What's going on?,dwight
33453,Stupid things wedged up there.  No one in this office will help me.,andy
33454,"Alright, move it.",dwight
33455,What if Dwight dies and I still owe him something?  That is a recipe for a ghost.,andy
33456,"Oh yeah, you're going to owe me big time.",dwight
33457,It's like a little envelope-- there you go.,andy
33458,Got it. [looks at envelope] To Dwight. Wha--  [opens envelope] Starbucks gift card.,dwight
33459,Surprise! [laughs]  It's from everybody.  $15 value.,andy
33460,Dammit.  I am no closer to taking Jim down.  What a waste of a day.  I could of grown poisoned mushrooms that would have been this high by now. [bends over and hold hand about 1/2 an inch from the floor]  They're mushrooms.  They don't get that high.,dwight
33461,Pamela Beesly Halpert--,michael
33462,What?,pam
33463,May I have a word with you in my office please?,michael
33464,I am working.,pam
33465,"Well, this is a work related matter.",michael
33466,Really?,pam
33467,Yes.,michael
33468,Really?,pam
33469,"Yes.  Join me please, won't you? [Pam gets up and follows Michael into his office]  I am going to give you a raise.",michael
33470,Why?,pam
33471,Because of all the good work you've done.,michael
33472,I have the lowest sales record of anyone here.,pam
33473,"That's-- no, no-- it's not about numbers, Pam.  It's about attitude.",michael
33474,I have the worst attitude of any person here.,pam
33475,Do you want the raise or what?,michael
33476,"Yeah, I'll take it. [turns to leave]",pam
33477,"Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached.  [Pam sighs]  And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.",michael
33478,You're bribing me?,pam
33479,No!  No-- no I am not.  Unless you want me to.  DO you want me to? Cause I will.  I will bribe you.  No.  Your face is saying don't-- unless I haven't offered you enough... your face isn't changing.  What is it?  Talk to me face.  Tell me what Pam's brain is thinking.  Come on!  What do you want? What do you want?  Do you want a million dollars?  Do you want to hit me?  Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or--,michael
33480,I want to hit you.,pam
33481,What?,michael
33482,I want to hit you.  I'll do that.,pam
33483,"[nervous laughter] Oh-- okay , what? I don't-- Are you kidding?",michael
33484,No.  Are you kidding?,pam
33485,Ye-- No.  Alright.  I'll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just--,michael
33486,No.  I don't think I can hit you in the office.,pam
33487,Okay.,michael
33488,"So, um... we'll do it after work.  In the parking lot.  In front of everyone.  I'm going to hit you as hard as I can.",pam
33489,Okay.,michael
33490,Okay.,pam
33491,Okay.,michael
33492,See you then.,pam
33493,See you.,michael
33495,Hey.,michael
33499,Never.  About what?  A little-- what are you talking--,michael
33501,What punch?,michael
33503,I'm pretty sure we said slap.,michael
33506,I-- mmm-- I'm good.,michael
33508,Hey.,michael
33509,Hey.,jim
33510,Do you and Pam ever get frisky?,michael
33511,Inappropriate.,jim
33512,I mean-- do you ever wrestle with each other?,michael
33513,All the time.,jim
33514,Really?,michael
33515,Yeah.,jim
33516,She strong?,michael
33517,She wants it bad Michael.,jim
33518,Can you stop this?,michael
33519,I can.,jim
33520,Okay.,michael
33521,And I don't support her choice to hit you.,jim
33522,I don't either.,michael
33523,But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.,jim
33524,Mmm-hmm.  I know.,michael
33525,I just need some time.,jim
33526,You gotta do something--,michael
33527,I just need some time. Just give me some time to make a decision.,jim
33528,How much time do you think you'll need?,michael
33529,No more than a week.  Maybe two weeks.,jim
33530,"Come on, man!",michael
33532,Oh...,pam
33534,Right.,pam
33536,Okay.,pam
33538,[stands up; gets into stance] Okay wait-- it's-- you're saying it comes from the foot.,pam
33540,Okay. [punches Toby's hand],pam
33542,Wow!,pam
33550,Am I scared of getting hit in the face?  No.  Everyday weirdo's pay dominatrix's hundreds of dollars for that very privilege.  I'm scared I'm gonna love it.  [claps hands] Let's do this.,michael
33551,It's okay guys... I can handle this.  Everybody can go home.,michael
33553,You're just a bunch of voyeurs.  Are you eating popcorn?,michael
33555,Are you ready?,pam
33556,Yes.,michael
33557,"[goes to punch Michael; he flinches] You have to keep your hands down, Michael.",pam
33558,I know. [sighs] Okay.  Alright.  [Pam goes to punch him again] Oh-- God!,michael
33559,"Michael, you have to put your hands down.",pam
33561,"Okay! [braces himself] Pam, Pam-- I'm really sorry.  I'm sorry.",michael
33562,What are you sorry for?,pam
33563,So many things.  I don't know.  It's hard to choose.,michael
33564,How about for dating my mom?,pam
33565,Maybe that--,michael
33566,And dumping her on her birthday.,pam
33567,Yes.,michael
33568,Okay-- just-- don't ever date a member of my family again.,pam
33569,Okay.  I promise.  [Pam starts to walk away] For the record your mom came on to me. [Pam turns around and slaps him; he gasps],michael
33571,Are you okay?,pam
33572,No!,michael
33573,You're okay.,pam
33574,Feel better?,jim
33575,No.  You were right.,pam
33576,"[walks with Michael back into the office; Michael is clutching is face and limping] Wait, why are you limping?",dwight
33577,I don't know.,michael
33578,Let's get some raw meat on that face.  I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.,dwight
33579,"As I watched Pam's big, strong hand coming towards my face I saw my entire life flash before my eyes.  And guess what?  I have four kids.  And I have a hover-car and a hover-house.  And my wife is a runner and it shows.  And Pam and Jim are my best friends and our kids play together.  And I am happy and I am rich and I never die.  It doesn't sound like much, but its enough for me.",michael
33580,Ahh... [Dwight is holding a frozen chicken to his face],michael
33581,"Good, good.  Keep it on there for another five minutes.  Just let the swelling go down.",dwight
33582,Oh thank you.  Thanks.  I owe you one Dwight.,michael
33583,Fire Jim.,dwight
33584,No.,michael
33585,I'm cashing in the favor.  Fire him.,dwight
33586,What are you talking about--,michael
33587,Do it.  Promote me.  Tri-managers.,dwight
33588,Forget that.,michael
33589,Can I have an office?,dwight
33590,No.,michael
33591,You know what you can keep your stupid favor.  It's worthless.  And this is my dinner on your face.  I'm keeping it.,dwight
33592,[pats face] Oh that feels better.,michael
33593,"[screaming, Phyllis and Dwight wrestling]  Got you!  Broken arm!  Boom Boom Boom!  Broken Nose! Boom Boom Boom Boom!  Broken Nose!  Boom!  Ha, gonna flip you!",dwight
33594,"Once a year Dwight holds a seminar updating us on the newest developments in the world of karate... because as we all know, the one thing thousand year martial arts do all the time is change.",jim
33595,"How can I pose this to you in a relatable way?  You are all members of the Yakuza and you happen to be visiting the Lackawanna trolley museum... and you are attacked by triads... how can you hold them off until your clan arrives?  You cannot go wrong with a throat punch [screams, pretends to punch Meredith in the throat]",dwight
33596,"OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know.",jim
33597,"No, there is a defense for that.  Let me demonstrate.  Someone attack me.  Kevin, go!",dwight
33599,False.  I did choke you with your shoelace.  Now come at me!,dwight
33600,"OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.",jim
33601,That is correct.  Unless there happened to be measles present.,dwight
33602,"So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?",jim
33603,Easy.  Allow me to demonstrate.  I am attacking myself with a throat punch.  Here it comes. [gives himself a fake throat punch]  Block.  Grasp wrist as such. [grasps wrist],dwight
33604,"And what if he comes at you with the other hand, because he does have two.",jim
33605,"Good point.  Second, throat punch, absorb the blow. [gives himself another throat punch and proceeds to both attack and defend himself]  Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut.  Uh oh, up to the nose.  No, you're not.  Ow!  Oh!",dwight
33606,"Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool.",jim
33607,"He really is, but not for long.  [steps on foot]  Ow! Instep, oh, not again.  [more screaming] You let go, you let go.  Oh, you're right, I can't hold on.",dwight
33608,You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.,jim
33609,The important thing to remember Jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise. [hits himself in the groin and moans],dwight
33610,But I would say my favorite art form is a tie between sculpting and stand up comedy.,michael
33611,I did stand up comedy once.,andy
33612,You did?,michael
33613,"Yeah, I killed.",andy
33614,That sounds like it was hilarious.,michael
33615,It was hilarious.,andy
33616,Michael?,dwight
33617,Yes?,michael
33618,What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?,dwight
33619,"You'll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day.",michael
33620,"This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin.",dwight
33621,"Woo hoo, shout out!",michael
33622,Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal.  I just want to stress that it's all conjecture.  If there's any concrete news you will know ASAP.,dwight
33623,"Erin, do we have the journal?",michael
33625,Did you?,michael
33626,"Michael, he means the Wall Street Journal online.",pam
33627,"Oh, the Wall.",michael
33629,It's $1.99 to finish the article.  I wonder what it was going to say? [no one makes a move to pay for the article],michael
33630,Are you serious? [starts typing on the computer and Andy begins to lean in toward the computer],jim
33631,"I got it, I got it... Oh, Tuna beat me to it.",andy
33633,"No, no, that doesn't make any sense.",michael
33636,"Oh, that sounds awful.",michael
33638,"Oh God.  Well, that's an interesting theory.",michael
33639,You know what?  You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows.  It doesn't pay much and you can't unionize.,dwight
33641,"Ah, well maybe you should spy on him.  [in Valley Girl voice] Oh my God, wouldn't that be hilarious! [laughs]",michael
33643,"OK, OK.  Good.  I'll catch you on the flippity flip.  Bye. [hangs up phone]  He's busy, he'll call me back when he's free.",michael
33645,"No, I'm just poopin'.  You know how I be.",michael
33647,Crazy world.  Lotta smells.,michael
33649,"I like Erin. There, I said it.  I was kinda hoping she would ask me out, but things have not panned out on that front, so... it is time for the Nard Dog to take matters into his own paws.",andy
33650,"[Michael in his office playing music loudly, Jim walks in and turns the volume down, Michael trailing off on singing]  We have to do something because people are losing it out there wondering what's going to happen.",jim
33651,"OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody.  Anything new on YouTube?  Doesn't even need to be good.  Oh God, I can't think, need more Mullins.",michael
33652,"Listen, Wallace said these were just rumors, right? So we have no reason to think the company is anything but fine.  So if we just go on with our work, you and me, they'll follow along.",jim
33653,"Monkey see, monkey do.",michael
33654,That's it.,jim
33655,Monkey pee all over you.,michael
33656,"That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?",jim
33657,We have a monthly staff meeting,michael
33658,"Alright, let's conference room it up! [everyone is now in the conference room]  Here's the deal guys.  There is no new information as of yet, so I suggest we all just keep working.",jim
33659,"Sure I'm a little nervous, but doing our work will make us feel better.  I only slack off when things are good.",jim
33660,"Customers have to use the coupon code from the website.  And as of now there is no differentiation between the letter O and the zero, but we are working on that. Stay tuned for that.",jim
33661,[Michael leaves] He needs me.  Seat saved infinity. [leaves],dwight
33662,"OK, great.",jim
33663,"[walks back in, on cell phone] What? Oh my God!  [everyone starts asking questions]  There has been a murder.  There's been a murder in Savannah. [runs back to his office]",michael
33664,"Games have the power to distract people from stressful situations.  Battleship got me through my parents' divorce.  Operation got me through my vasectomy, i.e., my operation.  I don't think I would have been able to endure my breakup with Holly had it not been for Toss Across.",michael
33666,"It is so much fun.  Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it...",michael
33667,"Hey, I am wondering if this is a, uh, terrible idea.",jim
33668,"This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, it's about murder.",michael
33669,I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this.,jim
33670,"Tube City, you owe me one.",michael
33671,"Co-managing is a give and take.  You have to pick your battles.  One of the battles that I picked was to stop Michael from running plastic tubes all over the office and placing hamsters inside of them.  He was going to call it Tube City. So, yes, I do owe him one.",jim
33674,"There will be food. You leave, you do not get food.",michael
33676,Sandwich platters.,michael
33678,Baby carrots. [Angela sits back down],michael
33679,"OK, here are your character cards.  Take one, pass it down. Here is your prop box, some of your characters will have props.  Now, on your character card, it tells you who you are, and what your alibi is.  Everything else is up to your imagination.  So, if you talk slowly in real life, your character could, say, have been kicked in the head by a horse.",michael
33681,"OK, use your imaginations.",michael
33682,Who'd you get?,andy
33684,"Oooooo, saucy.",andy
33686,"Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local bartender and Nellie's brother.",andy
33688,It's not scary.,michael
33690,Who are you?,pam
33692,"Well how do you think I feel?  I mean I have to play Caleb Crawdad, handsome playboy.  Every night, a different woman.  Being oogled.  Having to hug and kiss and spoon, I make them feel beautiful.",michael
33693,"[looks at Oscar who is using his phone, grabs it] Well, well, well.  What is this contraption, I do declare?",michael
33695,"Who's Michael?  I'm Caleb Crawdad, I do declare.",michael
33697,That is the way Southern people talk.,michael
33698,And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?,jim
33699,"Delta Burke, I do declare.  Now, shall we get to the mystery?",michael
33700,"I'll go.  [stands up, begins speaking with a southern accent]   My name is Deborah U. Tante.   Deb for short.",pam
33701,"That's clever, Debutante.",andy
33702,Bill Bourbon was my uncle.  I would have never hurt him any more than I'd hurt a June bug.,pam
33704,I do not.,pam
33705,"Well, you do actually.  You've got this kinda like Florida Panhandle thing going, whereas what you really want is more of a Savannah accent, which is more like molasses just sorta spillin' out of your mouth.",andy
33707,"Uh, not familiar, what province is he from?",andy
33710,"Wait a minute, wait a minute.  I'm the butler.  You were listening in on that?  You rich people.  You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!",dwight
33711,"No, no, no. Don't turn this into a political thing.",michael
33712,I will poison your food.,dwight
33713,"I reckon I got something to say to Miss Beatrix Bourbon, if'n she don't mind.",andy
33714,"Oooooo, doggie, we got a party now!",michael
33715,I do believe that the game is a big hit. People are really diving into their characters.,michael
33718,"[accent] Sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect.",michael
33720,"Very good, very good.  Now, no one was there in the wine cellar. [Creed gets in his car and drives away]",michael
33721,[in character] Hey there young lady.,andy
33723,I would be remiss if I did not ask the pretty young lady out on a date for this weekend.,andy
33725,"Alright, a plan it is.",andy
33726,"Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your dalliance with the Dark Arts.",dwight
33728,I know you did it!,dwight
33729,"I know she didn't do it.  It's never the person you most suspect. It's also never the person you least suspect, since anyone with half a brain would suspect them the most.  Therefore I know the killer to be Phyllis, AKA Beatrix Bourbon, the person I most medium suspect.",dwight
33735,"I'm a little worried I might have asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin.  Which would be a whole lot less appealing, because Naughty Nellie says yes to everyone.  And she might be a murderer.",andy
33739,"[accent] Whoa. What's this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son?  This here's Savannah.",michael
33741,"OK, I'm going back to work.",jim
33742,No no no no no no no. [accent] I'm going to skip forward to a relevant clue.  Here we go.,michael
33745,"[accent] Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- that's a misdirection.  We still don't know who the murderer is.  [everyone leaves] Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here.  I can't do this myself.  Voodoo Mama Juju... what am I gonna do?",michael
33746,"OK, so Corporate is still in their meeting.",jim
33749,"Alright guys, it's a work day and you guys work here, so let's go do some work.",jim
33752,"[Michael walks in] Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets.  Do you want to-",jim
33753,"[accent] I do believe you have me mistaken, my name is Caleb Crawdad. Y'all skedaddled way too soon.  We need to reopen this case.",michael
33754,"No, you're not reopening the case.  The case is closed.",jim
33755,No it ain't.,michael
33756,"Frankly, I'm not surprised.  A lot of the evidence seemed to be based on puns.",dwight
33757,"Just thinking about Weekend at Bernie's.  It's funny, the guy's dead the whole time.",andy
33759,"Speaking of weekends, you excited about our date this weekend?",andy
33761,"Yeah, OK.",andy
33763,"[accent] Well, finest steakhouse in all Savannah.",andy
33765,Did you mean a real date?,andy
33767,Totally... not. [Erin gets up and walks away],andy
33769,"You're sure it was water, it couldn't have been acid?",dwight
33770,"I already declared you, it was too dark to tell.",michael
33771,"Stop playing games with me, Crawdad.",dwight
33772,"This is not a game, this is my life.  You are out of order, sir.",michael
33773,Answer me.,dwight
33774,You are out of order.,michael
33775,You are out of order.,dwight
33776,You are-,michael
33777,I think Michael may have snapped.,pam
33778,Or maybe he's just stuck in character.,jim
33779,"Well, which is worse? Snapped or stuck?",pam
33780,Both.  They're both worse.,jim
33781,"It's going to be alright. We're a good company, we'll figure this out.  We're not going under.",jim
33782,"Jim, what if we both lose our jobs?  I'm trying to think of a way that this all ends up fine, and I can't think of one.",pam
33783,"[comes into Jim's office using accent] Deb, what in the world - do you have the vapors?",michael
33784,"Michael, not now.",jim
33785,"Can't wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now.  Come on.  Come on.",michael
33786,I should just go.  [accent]  Where to now Caleb?,pam
33787,To Mama Juju Boo Boo.,michael
33788,"Michael, can I... OK, I'm just going to skip right past the what and go with why.",jim
33789,Because this is the recreation of a crime scene.,michael
33791,Hey shut up.  You're dead.,dwight
33792,"Michael, can I talk to you in your office?",jim
33793,"No Michael here, my name is-",michael
33794,Caleb!,jim
33795,Today of all days...,jim
33796,"No, you shut up.  They need this game, Jim.  Let us have this stupid little game, alright? [Jim nods]",michael
33797,"[accent] Oh, you startled me.  My stars, my heart nearly leapt out of my chest.  What can I do you for?",michael
33799,Detective Wallace?,michael
33801,"Aw, shucks, tell him I'm not here.",michael
33803,"No, I only answer to Detective Wallace 'cause I got a warm body in the other room.",michael
33804,I'll take it.,jim
33805,Hey David.,jim
33807,"Oh, OK.",jim
33809,"Sure.  Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-",jim
33811,OK.,jim
33813,See ya.,jim
33814,[Jim comes out of the office]  What's the news?,pam
33815,Nothing yet.,jim
33817,Well there is some bad news.  [accent] There has been another murder.,jim
33818,"A murder, you say?  I do declare.",michael
33819,Conference room everyone.,jim
33821,No.,jim
33823,"Oh, this could be a juicy one.",dwight
33824,Get in there!,michael
33825,"I think today was a good day to have two managers.  'Cause if you're a family stuck on a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean, one parent might want to just keep rowing.  But if the other parent wants to play a game, it's not because they're crazy.  It's because they're doing it for the kids.  And I get that now.",jim
33826,"There has been a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue.  My little heart can barely take it no more.  [regular voice] Today is the hardest I have worked in a long, long time.",michael
33827,"[Andy, Michael, and Dwight are pointing imaginary guns at each other] I didn't do it!",andy
33828,"OK, everybody just calm down.",dwight
33829,I am calm.,andy
33830,On the count of three we're all going to put down our guns.,michael
33831,I have crossbows.,dwight
33832,"We'll put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?",michael
33833,"OK, I'm ready.",dwight
33834,"One, two, three.. [all scream]",michael
33835,"Andy revealed himself to be a double agent.  At which point Dwight felt comfortable revealing that he also was double agent.  And then Michael announced to everybody that - get this- he was a double agent.  Oh, and it is 6:00.",jim
33836,"[Michael, Dwight, Andy and now Pam are in the circle and training their 'weapons' on each other, Jim walks in]  Really?",jim
33837,[accent] It wasn't me.  I'm not goin' down for this!,pam
33838,"Yeah, I want to go home.",jim
33839,"Get the keys out of my purse, start the car. [Jim and Pam slowly back out of the office, Pam has her weapon trained on everyone and then they run out]",pam
33841,Bow down before Recyclops.,dwight
33842,"Five years ago, corporate said we had to start a recycling program for Earth Day so Dwight took the lead on that and introduced us to a very close friend of his named Recyclops.",jim
33843,"Happy Earth Day, everyone. I'm Recyclops. Did you know that an old milk carton can be sawed in half and used as a planter?",dwight
33844,The next year he really stepped things up.,jim
33845,Who has put a number seven plastic in a number four bin?,dwight
33846,A year after that Recylcops really began to take shape.,jim
33847,Recylops will drown you in your over-watered lawns.,dwight
33848,Then tragedy struck Recyclops when his fictional planet was attacked by some other fictitious thing... I can't remember.,jim
33849,Recyclops will have his revenge.,dwight
33850,I think this was also the year he renounced Earth Day and vowed to the destroy the planet he once loved.,jim
33851,"Oh my God, you guys, look. It's Recyclops.",pam
33852,Recyclops destroys! [starts tearing through the office],dwight
33854,Yes.,dwight
33856,Polluticorn wishes. [starts spraying the office with something],dwight
33857,That's aerosol spray. It's terrible for the environment.,andy
33858,Humans are terrible for the environment.,dwight
33859,The thing I like most about Recyclops is that he's creating a different world for our child.,pam
33860,Mmm.,jim
33861,A world where you truly can be anything you want.,pam
33862,"God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart. [Dwight throws an aluminum can towards the recycling bin and misses]",jim
33863,"[seated] Ok. Ok. How 'bout this? [rises, waves, sits back down]",michael
33864,That's great.,pam
33865,"I want it to be better than 'Great', Pam. How 'bout I remain seated... and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing. [demonstrates]",michael
33866,Sure.,pam
33867,Nope. Then my face is down. They can't see my face.,michael
33869,"Alan Brand is the CEO of the company, if title's important to you, has personally invited moi to go to New York to the shareholder's meeting  and sit up on the stage with the board of directors. And at some point they are going to introduce me as the most successful branch manager that they have. And then Michael Scott turns and waves to the crowd... and the crowd goes wild.",michael
33870,"[doing an announcer voice] Ladies and gentlemen from Scranton, Pennsylvania, please welcome Michael 'The Machine' Scott. [Michael waves, twirls and sits down]",andy
33871,Don't do the twirl.,pam
33873,The twirl sucks.,dwight
33875,[still doing the voice & spinning in his chair] Hate the twirl!,andy
33876,Ok. Obviously I'm not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave.,michael
33878,"I am not going to do the twirl. Alright? It's not even a twirl, it's a spin. I might do the spin.",michael
33880,"Ok, Oscar, I don't need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.",michael
33882,"Well, could you condense it please?",michael
33885,"It's not a limo. It's a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling.",michael
33888,They sent a limo.,michael
33889,Town cars suck. Town car is something that a company sends when they're in trouble. A limousine is something that a company sends when they have cause for celebration. And in this case I think we are celebrating me.,michael
33890,"[everyone is rushing down the stairs to see the limo] Oh, wait. Wait. Wow. Wow! Oh, no way. Look at that.",michael
33891,What kind of mileage does this baby get?,dwight
33894,Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs.,michael
33895,Calves. Calves all the way.,dwight
33896,I'm so jealous right now.,andy
33897,"Hey, you know who you should be jealous of? Yourself. Because you're invited and you're invited and you're invited and you and you and you and you and you and you-",michael
33899,What?,michael
33901,The limo seats eight. Ok. Then Jim and Pam and Ryan plus a guest.,michael
33904,[others  start raising their hands to be picked] Mmm... whoa.,michael
33906,"[in the limo with Dwight, Andy and Oscar] I wish the windows weren't tinted so people could see us in here.",michael
33907,"Hey, guys, do you think anyone might have had sex in here?",andy
33908,Definitely.,michael
33909,Smells like it.,dwight
33910,Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. That's bigger than my bed.,michael
33911,Word.,dwight
33912,Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!,andy
33913,[the limo driver raises the divider window] Who's playing with the button?,michael
33914,"Hey, Ryan. Could you start consolidating all our Rolodex information into Outlook?",jim
33916,But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program.,jim
33918,Could go either way.,jim
33920,Maybe we should just wait and find out.,jim
33922,Ok.,jim
33924,Nah. Might as well do it now.,jim
33925,"Michael, what if somebody asks you a question at this meeting? Are you just gonna wave, or what?",andy
33926,I will have to answer.,michael
33927,I'll ask you a question.,dwight
33928,"Make it a softball. Something he can, like, crank out of the park.",andy
33929,Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?,dwight
33930,"No, no. That's too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, 'Well, we're sort of on thin ice.' [they all laugh] I won't say that. I'll something like that.",michael
33931,This is your big day. Come on.,andy
33932,"Oh, my god. This is it.",michael
33934,Yes.,michael
33936,"Oh, hi.",michael
33938,"Well, thank you and, and please call - continue to call me Mr. Scott.",michael
33940,"Well, I guess this is as far as I can take you guys. So -",michael
33941,Kay.,andy
33942,"Good luck, Michael.",dwight
33943,See you later.,michael
33944,[walking past bodyguards at the door] Officers. Thank you.,michael
33946,Thank you.,michael
33948,Hello.,michael
33950,Thank you.,michael
33952,"Oh. It was awesome. Very, very sublime.",michael
33955,"It's nice to meet you, too. It's an honor and a privilege.",michael
33957,Ah. [bows] Your eminence.,michael
33959,"Coming through. Che, che, che, che, che, che. [spots microphone and gets in line, sees an empty mic and attempts to get there first] Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. [a line appears from nowhere] Ah. Damn it. [ heads back to the original line which is now even longer] Wha- okay [grunts]",dwight
33960,"I was hoping to lob Michael his softball question early. I wanted to swing by the garment district, pick up a few crates of my shirts. I got a shirt guy.",dwight
33962,"Yeah. Well, you should do that. Get in line.",andy
33964,"Look, do you want to be able to tell your grandkids you stood up for yourself during the - America's biggest financial crisis?",andy
33965,How is he gonna have grandkids?,dwight
33966,You guys ever protect the president?,michael
33968,What about Madonna? Or Obama twins? Anybody famous?,michael
33971,Rock and roll. [they walk into convention room and are booed by everyone],michael
33973,[to David] This is not as much fun as I thought it would be.,michael
33975,"[accidentally into his microphone] We're going bankrupt, you think? [angry jeering from the crowd] They are really angry.",michael
33979,No. You will not.,dwight
33981,"Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in a household with no consequences?",dwight
33983,Oh. If onlys and justs were candies and nuts then every day would be Erntedankfest.,dwight
33985,[loudly applauds] Yes.,dwight
33987,"Hey, Phyllis. Are you just getting back from lunch now?",jim
33989,Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me.,jim
33991,I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael. [Stanley laughs] What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.,jim
33994,"Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?",jim
33998,Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael? [everyone raises there hands - including Pam],jim
33999,Stuff gets around. I don't participate.,pam
34000,Who here heard it from Ryan?,jim
34002,Yes.,jim
34004,"I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright?  Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael? [Pam, after a moment,  is the only one who raises her hand]",jim
34005,I forgot I have to support him no matter what. Close one.,pam
34007,You should get up and say something. You've got to be true to what's in there. [points to Oscar's heart] Don't be a wuss.,andy
34008,"I've always been the guy who can rally other people to rebel. In high school I organized a walk out over standardized testing. Got over 500 students to just skip the SATs. At the last second I chickened out, took it anyway, got a 1220, always regretted it. I feel lachrymose .",andy
34011,"Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. These are not criminals. They are nice. They invited me to come here today. They invited me to their hospitality suite where I  had free food and it was delicious. Get this. Know how nice they are? The sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in Scranton. That's -",michael
34013,Yes.,michael
34018,I gotta make an example out of him. Should I just fire him?,jim
34019,Can you actually fire people?,pam
34020,"To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people.",jim
34021,"Well, I can't really imagine you yelling at anyone.",pam
34022,"Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.",jim
34023,"Oh. Ok. I've heard you exclaim. Like the time you said, 'Hey, look. We parked over here!'.",pam
34024,"Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day.",jim
34025,"Well, you'll figure it out.",pam
34028,"[board of directors has started to exit] Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen. We'll be back with some answers. [a few murmurs from the crowd of 'What answers?'] I - ok. I know that you're mad at me and you're mad at all them -",michael
34030,"Ok. Alright. We are gonna - we're gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We're gonna come back with a plan for you. It's a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track. [crowd starts to agree and perk up] 45 points. It's a 45 day/45 point. One point per day. We get the 45 points we are back in business. [crowd applauds] And you can take that to the bank. [applause continue] And Limo Lady, we are going completely carbon neutral. [crowd has gotten very excited and is cheering] I love you, New York! [Michael does the spin and leaves the stage - then runs back across the stage] You. You.",michael
34031,"Hey, Ryan. How's it going?",jim
34033,Mmm-hmm.,jim
34035,"Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it.",jim
34037,You know what?,jim
34039,I think I know the problem.,jim
34041,I think you seem distracted.,jim
34043,"But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help.",jim
34045,"I am, too. Let me show you.",jim
34046,Wow. Things are really picking up.,michael
34048,What?,michael
34050,I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.,michael
34052,"We tell them the plan, right?",michael
34054,"Here's what we're gonna do. The 45 day thing that I outlined, we go with that. Day 45, company saved. Day 44, go. What do we got? We have 15 minutes.",michael
34056,Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.,michael
34058,I am the guy who roused that crowd.,michael
34060,Got them on their feet.,michael
34062,They were so happy down there.,michael
34065,"Ok. Alright. Well, I know a guy. This Mexican guy. He is a math whiz. He knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and I am going to call in a little favor.",michael
34067,"Well, I'm texting him, so.",michael
34069,"It's done. [Oscar, sitting in the lobby, receives a text]",michael
34070,"Oh. There he is. Come on in. Come on in. Gentleman, I would like you to meet Oscar. Come on in. Don't be shy. This is Oscar Martinez. Oscar, why don't you come over here. Let me present you. Step up. Step up there. Oscar is an accountant extraordinaire at the Scranton branch and he has a wonderful idea as to how to get us out of this murky, murky situation. Take it away. [Oscar stands there stunned]",michael
34071,"I think this is really gonna help. If you could just hold up here one second. [addresses the whole office] Hey, guys. Quick announcement. If I could just have everyone's attention. [turns back to Ryan] I just figured you needed a place where you can concentrate and not be bothered by bothering people.",jim
34073,"Let me show you what I mean. [Jim opens the closet door to reveal a work station] Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done.",jim
34075,Right.,jim
34077,[laughs] You're a good kid. You know what? It gets bigger once you're in there. Enjoy it. [shuts the door and walks to his office],jim
34080,Tell them what you told me. This is genius.,michael
34082,Tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and - this is all -,michael
34084,It's all good. It's all good stuff. Lay it on them.,michael
34086,That wasn't what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better.,michael
34088,"O-kay. Oh... hey, hey. [follows Oscar into the hall] What are you doing?",michael
34090,"Wow, man. That -",michael
34092,That was embarrassing.,michael
34094,"For me, too. You embarrassed me.",michael
34096,"Well, that was a waste of a text. Let's get down to brass tacks. I think that we might be in trouble. We don't seem to have a plan so I'm thinking I go down there. Maybe rattle off a few jokes. Congressman could follow.",michael
34098,"Uh, I'm not a moron. Time after time my branch leads in sales. I have personally won over 17 Dundie awards. So, I am not a moron and I am just trying to help, you know? So... you're the moron.",michael
34099,[zipping through the hall while texting],michael
34100,"Yes it is a thrill to be honored by one's company. To have the people that you work for stop for a minute and say, 'Wow. Great job.'  That is what it is all about. Not the perks. Perks? The perks. I could take or leave the perks.  Limos are for people who make the company money not lose millions and have no plan. So we're leaving early. After all, we are the only ones with anything to celebrate.",michael
34102,"[running out of the building with Oscar, Andy, and Dwight] Oscar! Oscar! Come on!  There he is! There he is! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!  Scranton! Scranton! Scranton! Dunder Mifflin!",michael
34104,"Dwight Schrute, Scranton branch. I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble. [cheers from crowd] Thank you. Right. I know. And I just want to say that I believe that there are options out there. [crowd still applauding] A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to.",dwight
34106,Yeah.,dwight
34107,You wanted to see me?,andy
34108,"Yeah, Have a seat.",michael
34109,Is it serious? [Michael stares]  Wow.  Andy's a wittle scared.,andy
34110,"Okay, right there is the problem.  There have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk.",michael
34111,Why would people say that?,andy
34112,I have it on good authority that you said the following. [hands Andy a notecard]  Can you read that back to me?,michael
34113,Andy have a boo-boo tummy.,andy
34114,Mmm-hmm.,michael
34115,"Would you rather me say 'Hey guys, my irritable bowel syndrome is flaring up?'",andy
34116,Okay.,michael
34117,Crazy diarrhea happening right now?'  Cause things can get real adult real fast.,andy
34118,"You are also on record as saying 'wittle-ittle,' 'footy-wutties,' 'nummies,' 'jammies,' 'make boom-boom,' 'widiculous,' and 'wode iwand.'",michael
34119,"Do I sometimes replace Rs with Ws? Yes.  Do I sometimes repeat a word to get my point across?  Well if I do, Andy's sowwy.",andy
34120,You can't be a baby in the office.  It makes me look like I hire babies.,michael
34121,"Well if I we're complaining, a lot of people think your Elvis voice is annoying.",andy
34122,"Okay, who said that?",michael
34123,"I don't-just people.  For the record, I think it's pretty fantastic.",andy
34124,"[Elvis voice] Well, thank you... thank you a lot.  And for what it's worth I think your baby voice is tops.",michael
34125,[baby voice] Tank you Mr. Elwis.,andy
34126,"[as Elvis] You're welcome, baby.",michael
34127,"Dr. Tuna, MD, I have some terrible news.",andy
34128,"Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?",jim
34129,The entire office has come down with a pernicious case of the Mondays.,andy
34130,"Wow, what do you put our chances at?",jim
34131,"0%, unless we perform an immediate emergency morale transplant, stat!",andy
34132,"Hmm, sounds risky.",jim
34133,Don't worry.  There is a surefire cure.  Employee of the Month.  Every awesome place I've worked has had one.,andy
34134,"Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, my summer at Enron.",andy
34135,"Wow, that's not such a bad idea.",jim
34136,Great! [sits down],andy
34137,Anything else?,jim
34138,Nope! [stands up and leaves],andy
34140,Keep.,michael
34142,I want to keep those so I can see what I sent.,michael
34144,Keep.,michael
34146,For what?,michael
34148,Oh okay.  I don't know how those got on there...,michael
34150,Must be hackers.,michael
34151,Hey.  What's up?,jim
34152,"What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?",michael
34153,Did you murder someone?,jim
34154,Worse than that.,michael
34156,Lurk much?  [Erin leaves] I miss Pam.,michael
34157,I think she's okay.,jim
34158,Is that what we're going for now?  'okay?'  We used to go for 'pretty good.',michael
34159,"Great.  Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?",jim
34160,"Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better.  I'm not in this for the trophies, but...",michael
34161,"You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager.",jim
34162,"Well, technically, I'm a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month.",michael
34163,It would look bad.  Sorry.,jim
34164,"It would look good, on my mantle.",michael
34165,Jim's talking to Michael right now.  They totally went for our idea!,andy
34166,Yeah!  Your idea.,dwight
34167,"My idea.  I just need Andy to think it's his idea.  So it won't get traced back to me.  In approximately six hours, Jim will get a phone call from David Wallace.  He will be fired.",dwight
34169,[glances at it] Looks great.,pam
34171,Okay. [picks up and reads sheet]  The Michael Scott Foundation is still in existence?,pam
34172,There you are.  I don't think we have finished with my Inbox.,michael
34176,"Michael, why did you promise that?",pam
34177,To change lives.,michael
34178,"No Michael, why would you promise that?",pam
34179,"Yeah, okay.  Call the school, cancel.  I can't go through with this.",michael
34181,"Michael, this is a terrible terrible thing you've done.",pam
34182,Well...,michael
34183,It's terrible.,pam
34184,No.,michael
34185,"Just terrible.  And the longer you put it off, the worse it's going to get.",pam
34186,"I just, I fell in love with those kids.  and I didn't want to see them fall victim to the system, so I made them a promise.  I told them that if they graduated from high school, I would pay for their college education.  I've made some empty promises in my life, but hands down, that was the most generous.",michael
34187,"Just tell me it is going to be okay, all right?",michael
34188,No!,pam
34189,"I'm not a bad person, I bring good news.  Like when I promised those kids I'd pay for college.  Okay, all right.",michael
34190,You have to tell them.,pam
34191,"Would you come with me?  You know, like old times, instead of... [makes yuck face at Erin]",michael
34193,"It's fine.  Erin, you're going to go.  And you're going to make sure Michael tells the truth.",pam
34194,"Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse?",michael
34195,"Hey Jimmy, what's up?",dwight
34196,Not much.,jim
34197,"Cool.  Very cool.  I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.",dwight
34198,[laughs] Thanks Dwight.,jim
34199,That laugh is so infectious.,dwight
34200,You're creeping me out.  I'm gonna go.,jim
34201,I didn't mean any of those things I just said.  And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud.  Make it about the work.,dwight
34202,"Let me guess, you think you should get it.",jim
34203,"This encompasses all available data.  Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation.  Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency.  Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.",dwight
34204,"Well, in an ideal world...",jim
34205,"In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.",dwight
34206,"Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away 'Survival Skills' and 'Self-defense.'",jim
34207,I'm going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.,dwight
34208,"That's okay, I'll do it.",jim
34210,"Hey, Mikela Lasker, how are you?",michael
34212,Good to see you.  Where's your saxaphone?,michael
34214,"Eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of When The Saints Go Marching In that would blow your freaking mind.",michael
34216,"Well, you didn't even hear it.",michael
34218,"Oh, good.",michael
34220,Sure.,michael
34223,"Oh, yeah.",michael
34225,"No, not at all.  Nope, come on.",michael
34226,"Oh, you know what?  You know what?  I shouldn't go in there.  I'm pretty busy, I should just...",michael
34228,Oh.,michael
34234,Wow!,michael
34235,"Hey, so Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in-",dwight
34237,So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.,dwight
34239,He thought you were doing an incredible job last month.,dwight
34241,You seem suprised.,dwight
34243,"Hey buddy, so every-",dwight
34245,Five minutes ahead of schedule.  Right on schedule.,dwight
34248,"[crying] Oh, God.  Oh, God.",michael
34249,"Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Welcome.  I know you're all very excited, but no matter who gets this, I just want to say that you are all employees of the monthin my eyes.  And the winner is, employee number nine.  And that is?",jim
34250,"Number nine, number nine.  Jim Halpert.",andy
34253,"Oh, no!",dwight
34254,"Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-",jim
34256,"Guys, listen.  This was anonymous, all right?  There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here.  I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.",jim
34258,"Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it.  A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out.  Second of all, there was no cash prize.",jim
34260,Dwight?,jim
34261,"Yeah, you said 'In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize.'  Isn't that what you said?",dwight
34262,"No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money.  But-",jim
34265,"All right.  Wow.  Um, I am never going to forget today.  Not a chance.  I don't think I could ever give back to you what you have given me today.  Who here has done something stupid in their lives?  Like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between 'A' gym and 'B' gym, that sort of thing?  Show of hands, anybody, yes, a bunch of you, okay.  Well, me too, I've done something stupid which I would like to share.  Ummm. [period bell rings] Should we go?",michael
34267,"Ah.  All right.  I came here today because I promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable.  But you know what's invaluable is intuition.  You know what that is?  That is the ability to know when something is about to happen.  Does anybody out there have intuition?  Know what's gonna happen next?  Nobody?  Okay, you're going to make me say it.  All right, I am so proud of all of you.  Derrick, and Lefevre, and Ben, and Ayana, and Mikela, and Nikki and Jason, and... I'm sorry, okay, sorry spacing, your name?",michael
34269,"Well Zion, I am not going to be paying for your college tuition.  Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybody's tuition.  I'm so, so sorry.",michael
34270,I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.,michael
34272,"I lied to myself too.  I'm not a millionaire.  I thought I would be by the time I was 30, but I wasn't even close.  And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40, but by 40, I had less money than when I was 30.  Maybe by my 50s, I don't know.  I wanted to pay for your education.  I really did.  It was my dream.  Some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams.  My dream was in the right place.",michael
34274,"Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  Now I can't pay for your college.  But you don't have to go to class to be in class.  Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience.  And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop. [students perk up] Which is rendered useless without batteries, and I have one for each of you.",michael
34276,"Hey, hold-hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  They're lithium.",michael
34277,"Look, there was a big mistake obviously, so I will fix it.  Okay?  This was your idea anyway.",jim
34278,Correction.  It was my idea.,andy
34279,Okay.,jim
34280,My idea!,dwight
34282,"Ok, for the record, I am pregnant and, obviously there has been some kind of a mistake, so why doesn't Jim just pick the next highest score on the list and we'll move on.",pam
34284,"Excellent idea, Pam.",dwight
34285,Thank you.,pam
34286,"That would be employee number three, which would be... son of a bitch, Pam Halpert.",andy
34288,There must be some reasonable explanation for this.,dwight
34289,"No, wait, come on.  I didn't miss a day, I came in early, I stayed late, and I doubled my sales last month.",pam
34290,"Oh, really? From what, two to four?",andy
34291,Yup.,pam
34292,"Guys, this isn't some elaborate scam, okay?",jim
34294,"Okay.  That is me, but I didn't order the cake.",jim
34297,He knew all along!,dwight
34300,"[imitating Kevin] This is Kevin Malone, is David there?",dwight
34302,"Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam.",dwight
34303,[imitating Stanley] This is Stanley Hudson.  Jim Halpert is a menace.,dwight
34304,"[imitating Toby] It's Toby Flenderson.  Listen, things are getting really bad down here.",dwight
34306,"Erin, can you give us a second?",michael
34308,"Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I'm sorry.",michael
34310,What can I do?,michael
34312,"I can give you an extra laptop battery.  Not everyone took one.  How about this?  If you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay?",michael
34314,"Yeah, well, I owe you that at least, right?",michael
34316,Really? Wow.  That's over $200 a year.,michael
34318,"For-okay, okay here's what I'm gonna do.  I'm going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each.  I'm going to date them one year apart.  Now, you are to use one check a year.  And please call me before you cash the check?  Cause I've got monies to move around.",michael
34320,That's a lot of zeroes.,michael
34321,This is Jim.,jim
34323,"Hey, uh David.",jim
34325,"So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today.  It's been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.",jim
34327,No.,jim
34329,"I really don't know how it happened, David.",jim
34330,I know how it happened.,dwight
34332,"All right, it will not happen again.  I promise.",jim
34334,No!,dwight
34336,What?,dwight
34337,Yeah.  Thank you.,jim
34338,No.,dwight
34340,What?,dwight
34341,Yes.,jim
34343,"Oh, you're kidding me!",dwight
34344,See you.,jim
34345,Damn it!,dwight
34347,Please stop.  15 lives.  I destroyed 15 young lives today.,michael
34349,Yes.,michael
34351,"You're what, like, 12?",michael
34353,I think you're doing a great job.,michael
34355,"What do you want from this job, provided the company doesn't go out of business?",michael
34357,Really?,michael
34359,"You know, when I hired Kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse.",michael
34361,Yeah.  I just sort've had a feeling about him.  I have a feeling about you too.,michael
34363,"See you tomorrow, Dwight.",jim
34364,Apparently.,dwight
34366,"Not now, Temp.",dwight
34368,What?  Diabolical plan?  I wouldn't even know how to begin a diabol... [Ryan holds up a written copy of Dwight's daibolical plan],dwight
34370,So what do you want?,dwight
34372,"[yelling] Attention everyone! Jim and I, on behalf of--",dwight
34373,Too loud.,jim
34374,--the party planning committee...,dwight
34375,"Too, too loud. Too Loud.",jim
34376,"But effective, look! [everyone turns to pay attention] On behalf of Jim and I, Merry Christmas.",dwight
34378,Merry Christmas. Good.,dwight
34379,My diabolical plot is on hold for Christmas. My heart just melts with the sound of children singing. Hmmph! [laughs] Not really! I'm just tired. The days are short. I don't know. Maybe I'm depressed.,dwight
34380,It is time to unveil the tree.,dwight
34382,Yeah.,jim
34384,This is all we have.,jim
34386,"No, it's not 'ugh.' It is... office camaraderie.",jim
34387,It is warm feelings.,dwight
34389,Thirty! Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight! [others join],dwight
34390,Why would you start so high?,jim
34391,Twenty- seven! Twenty-six! ...,dwight
34392,"Three, two, one! [pulls sheet to reveal Christmas tree]",jim
34394,Ah!,pam
34396,No.,jim
34397,Exactly.,dwight
34398,"We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together.",jim
34399,Everyone.,dwight
34400,"Why would you wrap it in a sheet, if you're not covering anything up?",andy
34401,"Is it, is it fake?",pam
34402,Pam!,jim
34403,"Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die...",dwight
34404,Yes.,jim
34405,Like the spirit of Christmas!,dwight
34407,This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas!,dwight
34410,I begged Dwight and Jim to give me Erin for Secret Santa. And I decided to give Erin the Twelve days of Christmas. Is it my fault that the first eight days is basically thirty birds? [six geese are inside Erin's car],andy
34412,Hey Santa!,dwight
34418,"So Santa, what can we expect from this party?",pam
34423,"Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!",jim
34425,"For several weeks, my Secret Santa has been giving me pieces of a machine that I've been attempting to assemble. I'm suspicious of this because I had the exact same idea, for catching Osama bin Laden. I would simply send him a different piece each day. He would assemble it, to find himself... in jail!",dwight
34426,"You know Oscar every time I make this lasagna people ask me if it's a family recipe, but really, I just get the recipe from the box!",pam
34428,"Is it funny? I thought it was more ...interesting, than funny. [she walks over to see Oscar at the window looking down on man catching a football in parking lot]  I think my water just broke!",pam
34430,Oscar and the warehouse guy! Go Oscar! Go gay warehouse guy!,pam
34431,"Heeeeeere's Santa! Hey little girl, what would you like for Christmas? Ooh, you have been a very naughty girl, I see. [points to Pam's' pregnant tummy]",michael
34432,"Michael, we already have a Santa, Phyllis.",pam
34433,What the hell is going on?,michael
34434,"Phyllis, Jim? Phyllis is Santa?",michael
34435,Yeah.,jim
34436,Phyllis?,michael
34437,Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.,jim
34438,Take it back. That is absurd.,michael
34439,"No, I'm not gonna do that.",jim
34440,No? No! Jim! Come on!,michael
34441,I think she's doing a good job.,jim
34442,"It's insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesn't it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on!",michael
34443,I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can't be Santa.,jim
34444,"Fine! Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can- I -you know what, I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those.",michael
34445,"If this were Russia, yeah sure. Everyone would go to one Santa, and there would be a line around the block and once you sat on her lap and she'd ask you what you wanted, you would say probably 'freedom.' At which point the KGB would arrest you and send you to Siberia. It's a good thing Russia doesn't exist anymore.",michael
34446,"[santa voice] Ho ho ho! Why pay more to sit next to old Tranny Claus over there, when you can sit on my lap. Phyllis is only ... pretending to be a man, I'm the real thing. Sit down on my lap and there will be no doubt!",michael
34448,"No it's not, not like penis-wise. [as Santa] Hello little boy, what's your name?",michael
34450,"Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well.",michael
34452,"Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go. [Kevin sits on his lap. It's a struggle] Oh my God.",michael
34454,What would you like for Christmas little boy?,michael
34456,What did you think was going to happen?,michael
34458,"All right, just say 'some toys' please.",michael
34460,"Damn it Kevin, come on.",michael
34462,"Okay get off, get off! [pushes Kevin off] Oh! Oh, God!",michael
34464,Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesn't have to go through this again.,michael
34467,I'm trying Phyllis. You're Santa.,jim
34469,That's what I want.,jim
34471,What would Bob do?,jim

34511,Great!,jim
34512,Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are--,michael

34525,Not a gun. [crosses gun off his 'what could it be' list],dwight
34527,"I don't ask for much for Christmas, I really don't. It's not like I'm begging people to buy me diamonds and ...broach pendants. 'Oh buy me something expensive or I'm gonna kill myself.'  That's not - I don't care about that. All I want to be is Santa. And, you want to take that away from me?  Fine. Go ahead. But when you need my help because I am ruining everything, don't look at me.",michael
34528,"Behold! [extends his arms] Jesus Christ. And I bring to you glad Christmas tidings. I want to remind everyone the true meaning of Christmas.

34532,Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what you're saying?,michael

34555,Oh yes. It's space garbage. Dwight's gonna be able to build himself a friend! [sings] Deck the halls with crappy gifts...,michael
34558,"[on microphone] Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adultery's a sin, look it up in the Bible people. What'd you get?",michael
34560,"[on microphone] Oh, that's appropriate. Lot of fire where you're going. Better get used to it. You're going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. You're going to Hell Stanley.",michael

34576,I'll give you a hint. His last name is Christ. He has the power of flight. He can heal leopards.,michael

34580,What?,michael
34582,Really? What's going on?,michael

34597,Hey. How's everybody doing?,michael
34598,Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.,jim
34599,That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus.,michael
34601,"You know what's even more offensive, is baling on this party because some...  jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Here's my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room.",michael

34613,What?,jim
34614,How could we do what? [general murmur],pam
34615,It's not... Nevermind. Nothing. [arguing voices],michael

34983,He's uncomfortable because you're acting weird. So you have to stop acting weird.,pam
34984,What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?,jim
34985,That's the weirdest possible solution to the problem.,pam
34987,All right.,jim
34988,"I have come here today to talk to Mr. David Wallace about this whole thing going on with Sabre. [rings doorbell] He will know exactly what to do. He is not a big fan of me dropping by announced. But then again, who is? [loud drumming as door opens] Hey. Hi, sorry.",michael
34990,I hope you're not busy doing something.,michael
34992,You sure?,michael
34994,You look great too.,michael
34996,"Oh, yeah, that sounds good.",michael
34999,Hey. Wow.,michael
35001,Really loud.,michael
35002,"Wow. Oh, yummy. [David spreads marshmallow fluff on bread] You have got the life, my friend.",michael
35004,Can I just stay here and never go back?,michael
35006,"Oh, man. How much time do you have?",michael
35008,Yeah.,michael
35013,"Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd come by, see...",michael
35015,I don't know.,michael
35017,"There was one thing we were curious about, uh, your flexibility on things like Easter or Memorial Day, because we might want to change our days around a little bit.",jim
35019,"Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes.",jim
35021,Is this because Jim walked in on you going to the bathroom?,pam
35022,What?,jim
35024,Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you.,jim
35026,No.,jim
35027,"Maybe, because it doesn't seem to be going super well.",pam
35029,Nope. 'Cause we're really nice people but you don't seem to like us.,pam
35031,"Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?",jim
35033,Anybody could have walked in.,jim
35035,"Sabre is changing everything. [Michael and David sitting in hot tub] Site blockers. They don't let us use cups. So I started thinking, who could handle this? Who would know what to do? David Wallace would know what to do. What should I do, David Wallace?",michael
35037,Exactly. What are you thinking?,michael
35039,It is a tough one.,michael
35041,Yeah. But one would be good.,michael
35043,Okay.,michael
35045,Okay.,michael
35047,So the kid's making the noise to pick it up.,michael
35049,"Oh, okay.",michael
35051,"No, I think it is-",michael
35053,Yep.,michael
35055,"Hey, any fun weekend plans?",andy
35057,"Uh, no, actually. So nothing? No movies, or parties, or anything you might want to invite someone to?",andy
35059,Okay.,andy
35060,That's as hard as I can hint.,andy
35062,The what?,michael
35064,"Oh, okay.",michael
35066,Like it.,michael
35067,There are very few things that would make me not want to team up with David Wallace. And Suck It is one of 'em.,michael
35068,See you later. [hugs Wallace],michael
35070,Bye now.,michael
35072,Thanks for having me.,michael
35073,"Well, that's not the David Wallace that I remember. [reverses out of driveway, Wallace follows him] That is some sort of weird creature that lives in David Wallace's house. Oh, my god. Alright. Just get me out of here.",michael
35074,"Hello. [comes in carrying 4 gallons of orange juice and his water bottle] Is anybody home? Oh, thank you, Erin. Now if everyone would please ready their canteens, so I can fill them with the sweet, sweet nectar of Gabe's homeland, and then propose a toast. Here we go.",michael
35075,You know when people say getting fired was the best thing that ever happened to them? I feel sorry for those people. That's the best thing? Really? Ugh.,michael
35076,"Well, I'm not really one for making speeches.",michael
35078,But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you.,michael
35080,No. This is my toast.  I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it.,michael
35082,"Here's my toast. Orange juice is in here. And, like Saber, it is from Florida, and it is good.",michael
35084,Here's the toast. I'm gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.,michael
35086,"Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. That's like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesn't it? Okay, anyway, welcome.",michael
35102,"Hello Vancouver, this is Michael Scott calling from the United States of America!  I have a reservation in your fair city from February 12th to the 19th, first week of the Olympics.",michael
35104,Okey doke.,michael
35106,What?,michael
35107,[looking through Michael's email] I'm not seeing anything under 'confirmation.',dwight
35108,No.,michael
35109,Could it be under 'affirmation?' Cause you have thousands of those.,dwight
35110,No. [to hotel employee on phone] We're trying to look it up right now.,michael
35111,You [i]did[/i] get the e-vite to my barbeque!,dwight
35112,"Um, come on.",michael
35113,Michael...,dwight
35115,"Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I've always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation.",michael
35116,"Wait, I got it! Confirmation code: XV2RDM!",dwight
35118,Oh.,michael
35119,Thank you.,dwight
35121,That's it!,michael
35125,"Alright, I would like to cancel my reservation, please.",michael
35127,"Okay, put it on my card.",michael
35128,"Today, Jo Bennett, the CEO from Sabre, is coming to see us here for the first time. She bought us sight unseen, like a mail-order bride, so she's gotta be kinda nervous. I mean, are we ugly? Are we smart? Are we cool? Are we too cool? Do we speak English?",michael
35129,"[Jo Bennett enters with two humongous dogs, everyone stands to welcome her except Dwight] Why hello!",michael
35131,"Pleasure to meet you, Miss Bennett.",michael
35133,[Jo's dogs are sniffing at his crotch] These sure are pretty dogs...,andy
35135,They sure do.,andy
35137,"Oh, I do!",andy
35139,Hello.,dwight
35141,"I am treating you the same as a man, for whom I would also not stand. Unless it was the President. Or Judge Judy.",dwight
35152,Got some Valentine's cards for my coworkers and my bro-workers.,andy
35155,"Valentine's Day, right around the corner. Erin and I have been on zero dates. So I got her a Valentine's Day card, but I didn't wanna seem 'too eager,' so I got cards for everyone in the whole office to kind of dilute it a little bit.",andy
35156,"[throwing a card at Meredith, which skims her throat]: Look alive.",andy
35159,"Jo, I don't know how things work in Florida, which from your description sounds like a colorful, lawless swamp, but here it takes two men to do one job, where in Florida it might take one very strong woman to do such a job.",michael
35160,"Whoa, whoa.",jim
35161,"Whoa, whoa!",michael
35162,"I'll take over. Um, what we're doing here: Michael handles more of the 'big-picture' stuff, and I handle more of the day-to-day stuff, so together...",jim
35164,Alright.,jim
35166,No.,jim
35167,And sometimes I can hardly handle that!,michael
35169,I don't think so.,jim
35171,Forget the question...,michael
35173,I humbly accept the management position.,michael
35174,I... Why would you just say something like that?,jim
35175,"Because, well, Jim. Where I'm from, two types of folk: those who ain't, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain't you ain't? Ya'll come back now.",michael
35176,Do you even know what that means?,jim
35177,Yes.,michael
35179,Um...,jim
35182,"[almost running into Erin] Whoa-oh, traffic jam!",andy
35184,[imitating car noises] Beep-beep! Beeooop-beep!,andy
35186,"There's blood everywhere! Um, I got you a Valentine's card.",andy
35188,"Yeah, well it's Snoopy and Woodstock.",andy
35190,"Uh, Charles Schultz did. I thought it was relevant cause I got you all those birds for Christmas, remember?",andy
35192,"Oh, look at that. They sure do. I hadn't noticed.",andy
35194,"Yeah! It's Roger Federer for men, I sprayed some in there.",andy
35196,It's got pheromones in it.,andy
35202,"No, we know. Texas!",michael
35204,I could manage my way around that.,michael
35206,I will try to manage my excitement!,michael
35207,"I have been saying the word 'manager' a lot, so whenever Jo thinks 'manager' she thinks of me. Camel cigarettes did the same thing with Joe Camel by making him look like a penis. I can't even go near a cigarette now without thinking of a penis. And vise-versa.",michael
35209,"[Jo leaves] I, uh...",dwight
35212,"So, check this out. According to the handbook, you could make more money as a salesman than as a manager. They have all these incentive programs. I ran your numbers from last year.",pam
35213,This is way more than I make now.,jim
35214,"I don't think I'm gonna miss being manager. You know how some people say they're not in it for the money? Well, with all due respect to this job, I think I'm definitely in it for the money. And quite honestly, the women.",jim
35215,"Hey, you got a second?",jim
35216,Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?,michael
35217,"Actually, yeah.",jim
35218,What?,michael
35219,Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.,jim
35220,What? Really?,michael
35221,Yeah!,jim
35222,Wow!,michael
35223,"La la la, hello Oscar!",michael
35225,What are you reading?,michael
35227,"Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again.",michael
35229,"Why, is there an untapped gay market?",michael
35231,...Where did you get that information.,michael
35233,Manuel who?,michael
35234,"Well, according to the manual, there is no cap on commissions. I have been hustled.",michael
35235,Son of a bitch. [enters conference room] Pardon me.,michael
35237,Okay.,michael
35239,"Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales.",michael
35241,Really.,jim
35242,"Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you can't take the sales out of salesman.",michael
35244,"No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.",jim
35245,"No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people.",michael
35246,Why would you do that?,jim
35247,I'm turning myself in right now!,michael
35249,Thank you.,michael
35251,"Great! That's great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss.",michael
35252,"[pointing to the window in Michael's office] Oh, Michael marked his heights. He's grown!",pam
35253,Mm!,jim
35254,"[on phone] Bobcat, this is Dragon. Listen. He's been promoted to sole manager. We've got to step this up. Meet me behind the dumpster in ninety seconds. [hangs up phone] 89... 88...",dwight
35255,You're twenty minutes late!,dwight
35257,Just admit you lost track of time.,dwight
35258,Ryan and I have been meeting up to work on our diabolical plot against Jim. Ryan is always late for our meetings. I wish I had a lair.,dwight
35260,Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.,dwight
35262,"Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw.",dwight
35264,I like where you're going with this. Continue.,dwight
35266,I have an old barn!,dwight
35268,"It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?",dwight
35270,"Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!",dwight
35272,He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think!,dwight
35274,Think!,dwight
35277,How is that possible?,michael
35279,"No excuses Erin, come on! Make it happen.",michael
35281,"Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers? [Michael's phone rings] Michael Scott, head of sales.",michael
35282,"[on phone] You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there.",jim
35283,The new IT guy. Nick.,dwight
35285,"I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.",dwight
35287,"Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?",dwight
35289,Smeagol was corrupted and became Gollum.,dwight
35290,I might start a diabolical plot against him after this one.,dwight
35292,What is that?,jim
35294,"Oh. I'm fine. Thank you, though.",jim
35296,Why would I wanna do that?,jim
35298,"For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here...",jim
35300,Yeah. Thank you.,jim
35302,"[on phone] It will be a pleasure doing business with you. Thanks, bye. [hangs up phone, blows train whistle] I just got a new account for the gentleman's club in Carbondale. It is called 'Curves.' I went by there the other day, saw some of the women walking in. Not really my cup of tea. Actually, Kevin, you might like it!",michael
35304,"You know, we really don't announce out loud our sales that much.",dwight
35305,Why not? It's part of the sales experience.,michael
35306,It's not really 1992 anymore.,dwight
35307,"Well, okay...",michael
35315,"Ho-ho. There he is, the IT guy. So you discovered the break room.",dwight
35317,"I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone's computer passwords.",dwight
35319,"Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.",dwight
35321,"No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert's computer.",dwight
35326,What is that smell? Do you smell that? What is that? Like a sulfur deposit under here?,michael
35327,"Michael, stop.",pam
35328,"No, I'm serious, we don't have to put up... Is it the dogs?",michael
35329,Michael...,pam
35330,"You know what, we don't have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps.",michael
35331,"Michael, it's Phyllis.",dwight
35332,"No, this is geological.",michael
35334,Are you kidding me?,michael
35336,And you guys are okay with this?,michael
35337,"She sent an email, so.",dwight
35339,[has two tissues in his nostrils] It's not cause of the smell. I'm just expecting a nosebleed.,andy
35340,Oh my God.,michael
35342,"I'm sorry, I thought you saw me.",andy
35344,"Cool, thanks.",andy
35346,...That was weird.,andy
35348,I don't even know what that card said.,andy
35350,Hey.,michael
35351,Hey.,jim
35352,"You know, it's funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I'm out there, and I wish I was in here.",michael
35353,"Well, the grass is always greener.",jim
35354,Yeah. Except there's no grass out there. It's just a farty dirt patch.,michael
35355,"Well, it's what you wanted.",jim
35356,I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.,michael
35357,"For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do.",jim
35358,"We make a poster that says 'Happy Opposite Day!' and she sees it on the way out... Nah, that's stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black.",michael
35359,"Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her.",jim
35360,Lethal Weapon?,michael
35361,That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.,jim
35363,What? What I'm saying...,michael
35364,"Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly.",jim
35365,"And weirdly I'm a good dog person, right guys? [dogs go to him] See? They love me.",michael
35367,Alright.,jim
35368,Alright!,michael
35370,"[Erin leaves room] Excuse me? Everyone? Please check your emails, I just sent you the following message: 'Coworkers, you may have received a Valentine from me. Please understand this does not mean that I like you in any way.'",andy
35372,"Phyllis, you guys are like my closest friends. I just mean I don't like-like you.",andy
35374,"Please don't read into this card. Yours in professionalism, Nard dog.'",andy
35376,It's n-- that wasn't... I like someone else.,andy
35378,"It's not... Whether or not, you...",andy
35381,"Oh, it smells good in here.",michael
35383,"Erin, what about my keyboard? [Erin hits a button on an electronic keyboard, playing a beat] Aw, so good to be home. How about a little Bosa Nova?",michael
35385,[gesturing to Michael dancing in his office] He looks happy.,pam
35386,Yep.,jim
35387,"Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he [Jim dunks Dwight's tie in his coffee cup, Pam smiles] what? Michael!",dwight
35388,[entering elevator with Ryan] I can't help but think that something we did made this possible.,dwight
35390,"Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?",dwight
35392,Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.,dwight
35394,"It is not 'farm boy swill,' I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious.",dwight
35396,"[on the phone with a client] I just wanted to check and see if there's anything you needed before I went on my maternity leave...  Yeah, I'm pregnant...  Great, well, I'll write up the order.  Okay, thanks.",pam
35397,Wait a minute!  You can't do that.  You cannot exploit your baby for sales.,dwight
35398,"[on the phone] Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  I'm excited.  Oh, definitely.",jim
35399,"No, no!  You need to come by your sales honorably!",dwight
35400,There is nothing dishonorable about talking about your life.  People like it.,pam
35401,"[on the phone with a client]  Hey there.  Dwight Schrute here.  Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ...  Yeah, I could sure use the money.  My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus.  Oh, it's just horrific.  The  doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly.  Okay.",dwight
35402,"I need a baby.  I'll never outsell Jim and Pam without one.  Also, I've been noticing a gaping hole in my life.  Sometimes I wake up cradling a gourd.",dwight
35403,"Kevin, you're such a gourmand.",pam
35405,Hmm.,pam
35408,"Mmmm, that sounds great.  What are you thinking?",pam
35411,"No, no.  I still have time.",pam
35412,"I'm having contractions, but they're irregular and far apart.  So I'm not really in labor, I'm near labor.",pam
35413,"Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.",jim
35414,"If we check in after midnight, I get an extra day to recuperate surrounded by doctors.",pam
35415,"Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.",jim
35416,I cannot wait for that joke to be over.,pam
35417,Ooh.,pam
35418,"Oh, oh, oh!  Contraption!  She's contrapting!  Okay, you know what?  I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why.  I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania.  I gassed up the car...",michael
35419,Michael.,jim
35420,"Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.",michael
35421,"Michael, you shouldn't have done that.",jim
35422,"Happy to do it.  Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.",michael
35423,"You know the baby's not going to live here, right?",pam
35424,"Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.",michael
35425,"Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.",jim
35426,"Oh, yuck!  TMI!  How was it?  I don't want to know.  Tell me later.  Let's go!  Let's go!  Hospital!",michael
35427,"Okay, okay, we're not going to the hospital.  We are waiting until midnight.",pam
35429,Because the insurance company only covers two nights.,jim
35430,Everything's fine.  We have plenty of time.,pam
35432,"Shut up, Nick.  What a weird thing to say.  Weird I.T. nerd.  Don't get revenge on me, nerd.",michael
35434,"Ha, nerd.",dwight
35436,[with Angela in the break room]  Bare my child.,dwight
35438,"I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother.  If you agree, say nothing.  If you disagree, say anything...  Very well.  Let's meet at 4:00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.",dwight
35439,[after Pam has another contraction]  That's seven minutes.  Here we go.  This is happening.  Come on.,jim
35440,"Hold on, hold on.  It isn't midnight yet.",pam
35441,Are you serious?  Pam.,jim
35442,"No, the doctor said every five to seven minutes.",pam
35443,"I...  Pam, please.",jim
35444,"I'm going to be okay, we should really try to make it until midnight.",pam
35445,"Yeah, no, you really should.  Because if your baby's born tomorrow, he's going to have the same birthday as Butt-mud Brooks.  My old roommate.",andy
35446,Did you hear that?  Butt-mud Brooks.,pam
35447,"Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.",jim
35448,Five minutes apart.,pam
35449,"So, the plan was seven minutes.  But we're calling an audible, because that's her call.  Because she's the quarterback.  I'm just the left tackle who happened to get her pregnant.",jim
35450,"Okay, stop watching me.",pam
35451,"Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.",jim
35452,Mm-hmm.,pam
35453,"Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal.  While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?",jim
35454,Not until midnight.,pam
35455,"Guys.  Word of advice.  Speaking as a former baby.  Don't get too hung up on baby names.  I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds.",andy
35457,"My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him.  I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book.",andy
35458,"You know, it's getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.",jim
35459,"No, no, no, no, no.  You know what?  You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.",michael
35460,"[as Andy and Kevin shout 'yeah!' in response to Michael] Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals.",jim
35461,"Actually, the distractions are good.  I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it.",pam
35462,"Distractions are good!  That means conference room, five minutes!  No, no, five seconds!  Right now, right now!  Conference room!  Topic, potpourri!  Let's go!",michael
35463,"Um, I am sort of a master of distraction.  When I was a kid, my mom received compliments left and right from my teachers on how I was always able to distract others in class.  Try to think, what were the first thirteen colonies?  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  [Michael covers his mouth and makes fart noises.]",michael
35464,The purpose for this meeting is to take Pam's mind off of what's going on inside of her body.,michael
35465,Can we do sleight of hand tricks?,andy
35466,I will allow that.,michael

So, I did what anyone would do.  Read a book, had a bath, I got a good night's sleep, and I made plans to eradicate it.  I also made plans to ask Jim where he bought his marvelous sheets...  Time to get to work [he begins to destroy the kitchen with a sledgehammer].",dwight
35759,"There she sat.  Her name was Pam.  She was a receptionist.  She was engaged to an animal.  There sat Jim.  He was a gawky, tall salesman.  The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able.  I made a family!  I got these two together, and I made a family.",michael

35786,"One, and then wrap around.  It's okay.  Hold that arm down.",pam

35790,Go.,pam
35791,Nurse!,jim

35794,Really?,jim
35795,Doesn't feel right.,pam

35797,How does one do that?,pam
35798,Wasn't it...  It's kinda like a...  Like that.,jim
35799,"Do you want to try it, Jim?",pam
35800,I think you're good.  Doing a good job.,jim
35802,"Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.",jim
35803,I can't tell if she's getting anything.  It just doesn't really feel right.,pam
35805,Even if she's not getting anything?,pam
35807,No.  I read in the book about nipple confusion.,pam
35809,"She's just, she's really tentative about latching, and I just, I want to keep her self-esteem up.",pam
35811,Alright.,jim
35813,It's going to be alright.,jim
35814,Maybe it'll be good because then she can like socialize with the other babies.,pam
35815,"Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.",jim
35817,"What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?",michael
35820,I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.,michael

35830,"Sure.  Kevin, please leave.",michael
35832,Bye.,michael
35834,Okay.  This is going to kill Kevin.,michael

35838,"No, Kevin doesn't have an elephant heart.  But he is very sensitive.  And it won't kill Erin just to go and have lunch with him in the break room like I promised him...  I bet his heart is enlarged, though.",michael
35840,Just don't let him sit on you...  I'm kidding.  You'll have fun.  It'll be good.  It'll be good.  There he is.  Go to him.,michael

35849,I know.,pam
35850,You see that?  I'm pretty sure she's...  Hi.,jim
35855,"Why was I hiding behind the plant?  Ha, well, in college, I took a botony class, and there was lots of drama in that class.  Uh, kids would gossip about me, so I would eavesdrop on them by hiding behind different plants in the botony class.  And then, uh, they would say things like 'Oh, this guy's going to fail this class,' or, 'What's this guy doing spying on us from behind plants?'  And then I would jump out of them and confront them, and be like, 'Oh, you think all I do is hide behind plants and spy on people?  Busted.' ...  Oh, the reason?  The reason I was hiding behind that plant in this situation was that I thought that Erin and Kevin were kind of hitting it off, and...  I was jealous.",andy
35857,Yes?,pam
35859,"Um, yeah, that would be great.",pam
35860,Yup.  Really great.  When's she available?,jim

35864,"Oh, thank you.  Is that um, I can't tell if I'm really producing.  I don't know if she's getting anything.",pam
35866,Okay.,pam
35868,Okay.,pam
35870,"No, I mean, it feels...  pressure.",pam
35872,Are you sure it doesn't hurt?,jim
35873,No.  It just feels like pressure.,pam
35875,Yup.,jim
35877,Yeah.,jim
35879,Perfect.,jim
35881,I think she will.,jim

35883,We'll figure it out.,jim

35887,Thank you.,jim
35889,Okay.,pam
35890,Please do.,jim
35891,"Oh, shoot.",pam

35894,"Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing.",jim
35895,"Will you just, will you grab Clark real quick?",pam
35896,No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.,jim
35897,"Um, Jim, please, please, please, I think it'd be weird if you did it.",pam
35898,"Okay, I'll just go get the other guy.",jim
35899,"[on the phone]  Hey, what's up, kid?",dwight
35901,"Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts.  Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?",dwight
35903,Very well.,dwight
35905,"[trying to sleep as the baby cries]  Jim, Jim, get her.",pam
35906,Hmm?,jim
35907,Get the baby.  Get her.  Come on.,pam
35908,Okay.  Sshh.  I know.  [hands the baby to Pam],jim
35909,I got her.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay...  Jim!  She latched!  She latched.,pam
35910,That's amazing.,jim
35911,"Oh, my God.  I didn't even have to do the 'C thing.'",pam
35912,That's awesome.,jim
35913,"Aw, we're doing it.",pam
35914,that's great.,jim
35915,We're really parents now.,pam
35916,Mm-hmm.,jim
35917,Kevin.  Erin would like a few words with you.,michael
35930,"Oh, my God, this is agonizing.  Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?",michael
35932,"Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin.  And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place.",michael
35934,No.,michael
35936,Lynn was as hot as Erin.,michael
35938,"This isn't about me, and that is debatable.  And I have a personality, where as you...  Yes, Andy?",michael
35939,[he hits his head on the desk after ducking out of the way from hiding behind a plant]  Ow.,andy
35940,Kev...  Nice.  Going.,michael
35943,"Oh, hey, Isabelle.",pam
35944,Hey.,jim
35946,"Yes.  She was a little fussy earlier, but she's totally quieted down.  Here, let me just, uh, let me just burp her.  I don't want her to spit up on you.  Come here, sweety...  Oh, my God!  Wrong baby!",pam
35947,What?,jim
35948,Wrong baby!  This is not our baby!  Sshh.,pam

35950,"Oh, my gosh.",pam
35952,"No, not at all.",pam
35953,Perfect.,jim

35957,Ha ha ha.,jim
35959,"We definitely are.  At 3:00, right?  You said we could stay until 3:00?",jim
35961,Half hour.,jim
35963,"Yes, car seat's right there.",jim
35965,"Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.",jim
35967,"Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be...  Can we get a late checkout?  I don't...  I don't think she heard me.",jim
35969,"Isabelle.  Hello...  Yeah, the uh, kitchen was disgusting, so...",dwight
35971,Yup.,dwight
35973,"Oh, it's...  In the backyard.  I'll take this.",dwight
35975,"Hey, listen.  I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning.  You know, just for fun.",dwight
35977,"Are they now?  Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right?  Ha ha.",dwight
35979,"Alright.  I'll call you, kid.",dwight
35981,Are you really sure we should be leaving?,jim
35983,"But you hear the baby crying, right?",jim
35985,"Uh, it's in the lot.",jim
35987,"Right, okay.  Yes, that would be the smart thing to do.  Uh, Pam, I will be right back.",jim
35988,"Okay, please hurry.",pam
35989,"Erin, uh, I need you to send this fax immediately.  It's really important, so I'm going to stand here and wait for the confirmation.",andy
35991,"The fax says 'Erin, will you have dinner with me?' from Andy, and the number is our office fax number.",andy
35993,"Sorry, that's unacceptable.  I need you to send it immediately, or you're fired.",andy
35995,"Oh, God, no.  I'm...  Just read the fax.",andy
35997,I'm...  I'm asking you out.,andy
35999,"So, it's a date.",andy
36001,"Yeah, what day?  What day?",andy
36003,"Well, that, what's that one?",andy
36005,Okay.  Let's do it.,andy
36008,"Oh, yeah, sorry.",pam
36010,"Okay, alright, thanks...  Okay, do you want to eat?  You want to try eating?  Okay...  Okay, let me...  Just you and me.  Come on.  There we go...  Yeah...  Oh, yeah.  Like that.  There we go.  You got it.",pam
36011,Five tickets on the windshield...  Hey.,jim
36012,Hi.  We did it.,pam
36013,"You used my move, didn't you?",jim
36014,I used a variation of your move.,pam
36015,"[smoking a cigar]  There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love.  And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today...  I think I'm going to be sick...",michael
36016,"Two forms of ID, please.",dwight
36018,Nothing.,dwight
36020,Just pour yourself a cup of apple juice.  I feel sick...  [Jim and Pam walk in to their house with the baby]  I couldn't find the iPod...  Give me a couple days.  I'll be out of your hair.,dwight
36021,Hello hello. Top of the morning to you!  Ooh ooh! Green M&Ms! Nature's Viagra! [Grabs and pours Kevin-esque scoop of M&Ms into his coat pocket] Two of my favorite joke areas combined. It'll be a good day.,michael
36030,"It is St. Patrick's Day, and here in Scranton that is a huge deal. It is the closest that the Irish will ever get to Christmas.",michael

36035,Welcome back Tuna!,andy

36044,Okay. [Pulls desks apart] Just gotta...,jim
36045,Okay. Come on! Jim!,dwight
36046,"Dweedle Dee and Dweedle Dumb-ass have been away on maternity leave. Now Dweedle Dumb-ass is back, and we have a problem. Yes, getting hooked on Mega-Desk was my own damn fault. But ... I don't care about assigning blame. All I care about is Mega-Desk. That is all I care about. Getting. More. Mega-Desk.",dwight
36048,Morning!,jim
36051,"Morning, honey-pile.",michael
36053,It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.,michael
36055,Yes it is!,michael
36057,"No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal.",michael
36059,"Mm, that sounds great, actually.",michael
36061,"When you work for Sabre, only one thing matters. And I don't care if you're a loser, or you practice bestiality, if Jo likes you, you are in. And I am in!",michael
36062,Erin go braugh!,andy
36064,Thanks. It's actually my sister's old field hockey skirt.,andy
36065,"Erin and I have our first date tonight, and it has to be perfect. Why? Because according to 'How I Met Your Mother' that's the date that your kids are going to wait patiently to hear about, and you better have a good story for them.",andy

36067,Great.,dwight
36068,No.,jim
36069,Thank you. [hangs up phone],dwight

36076,Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon. [hangs up phone],jim
36077,"Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?",dwight
36078,It is. Big time.,jim
36079,"Ah, that baby is just discovering the whole wide world right now.",dwight
36080,Pretty amazing.,jim
36081,"What up is, what down is, who Mom is, who Dad is. Must be tough being here with all that going on.",dwight
36082,Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons.,jim
36083,"I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father.",dwight
36084,Is that what happened to you?,jim
36085,"I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.",dwight
36086,That's a common mistake.,jim
36087,"Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending.",dwight
36094,That is a great idea JB.,michael

36104,Okay.,michael

36121,"Well, I am heading down there.",michael
36123,How about July 4th weekend? [Reveals paper ticket],michael
36125,I did!,michael
36127,"You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and -",michael
36129,"All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.",michael
36130,Let's follow the chain of events. Jo likes Michael. Jo invites Michael to house. Jo doesn't like Michael anymore. Hmmm.,michael
36132,"Hello. I want you to stop what you're doing right now. You are stressed, and I'm taking you to lunch.",michael
36134,No is not an option.,michael
36136,"All right. Well if you need me, I'll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no.",michael
36138,[laughs] I'll be over there.,michael

36141,What?,jim
36142,My headphones are broken.,dwight
36143,Right.,jim

36157,"No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--",jim
36159,"You know, can I call you back?",jim
36161,"That would be great, thank you.",jim
36163,"[On phone in hallway] No, I know I need to work, I just- I feel weird not being home.",jim
36164,I am not surprised that Dwight's using my baby to steal my desk. I'm a little surprised that it's working.,jim
36172,She should go home. It's not the end of the world. We'll go on our date next week. She's still gonna like me in a week. Right?,andy
36174,I was just working at my desk and I wanted to run some new leads by you. [Turns feint],andy

36178,I have some good ideas...,andy
36180,You sure?,andy
36182,Very nice.,michael
36184,"A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo's eye. How'd you make that happen?",michael
36186,"Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?",michael
36188,"How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?",michael
36190,Okay. All right.,michael
36192,Hey there. So I think I'm done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier.,michael
36194,"Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so.",michael
36196,Right. What?,michael
36198,Mm. mm. Oh well.,michael
36200,"No, no, no. That's super-clear-ish. [Exits, closes door, takes off coat.] Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.",michael
36202,Hey Pack-man.,michael
36204,How you doing stud? You already there?,michael
36206,How's the lady situation?,michael
36208,"Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.",michael
36210,Yeah. Maybe next year.,michael
36213,Hi!,andy
36215,"That's okay, I'm in my 'worky-works.' You look amazing!",andy
36222,"Ah. Got a little client meeting at Shanny O'Gannigan's tonight. It shouldn't go all night long, so if you'd like me to, I could swing by your house so the baby can experience a strong male presence. [Jim is silent] No? Nothing? Okay. Have fun working. [Whistles 'Cat's in the Cradle' song]",dwight
36223,"Hi there Jo. Sorry to interrupt. Um, this evening [phone rings] I have...",dwight
36225,"Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.",jim
36227,"You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!",jim
36229,Okay.,jim
36231,"Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week.",dwight
36233,[pops back into Jo's doorway] Thanks again by the way.,jim
36242,It is? I'm sorry.,andy
36244,"Okay, thanks.",andy
36246,Whoa!,andy
36248,I didn't know you had a brother.,andy
36250,"Well, any brother of Erin's is a friend of mine. Nice to meet you. Andy Bernard. [They shake hands]",andy
36252,"Are we rotating seats, or?",andy
36256,"So, how does the whole foster sibling thing work? Do you guys share one parent or-?",andy
36258,All right. Formative years. [She laughs],andy
36260,"Yeah, it's a kilt.",andy
36264,How late do we have to work tonight?,michael
36266,Why does she do that? Why doesn't she just tell you what your schedule is?,michael
36268,"Do I really want to turn out like Gabe? Twenty-six. Single. Tied to my desk. No life, no family. I want to have been married by the time I would've turned thirty. That's just - that's just depressing.",michael
36269,Hello Jo.,michael
36271,"There is, as a matter of fact. It's getting sorta late. It's 8:30. And it's St. Patrick's Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I'm going to dismiss my employees.",michael
36273,"I'm thrilled with the work they've done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around.",michael

36279,Ooh. It's coming down out there.,andy
36281,"No, I-",andy
36283,"Ah. Oh great, now I'm gonna get sick. [They both laugh]",andy
36284,"Excuse me, excuse me. Hey guys!",michael
36286,Drinks are on me!,michael
36288,Oh -hoh! All right.,michael
36289,"Did I mess up my career today? My future prospects at Sabre? I don't know. There is a chance. Yes. I tell you I love my job. But Jo wants me to put on a show for her, and pretend to work late?  Nah. I spent all day, trying to make her like me, and I forgot to ask myself something: Do I even like her?  As the Irish poet Bobby McFerrin says, 'Don't worry, be happy.'",michael
36291,"Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever. [Meredith joins behind Packer] What the hell is going on back there?",michael
36292,Yeah. We should be able to have that right over to you by Monday. Yeah no problem. [Reveal Jim behind Quad-Desk] Thank you.,jim
36293,What the hell is this?,dwight
36294,Oh!,jim
36295,This is not Mega-Desk.,dwight
36296,"No, it's not. They call it Quad-Desk.",jim
36297,"That's ridiculous, this is made up of three desks.",dwight
36298,Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we? [Dwight's phone rings. He crawls into nook under Jim's Quad-Desk],jim
36299,"Hello, Dwight Schrute?",dwight
36300,"Hey Jim, Jim. Come here. [holds up photo] Do you know who that is?",michael
36301,No.,jim
36302,"Look at him. Look at him - t-shirt, jeans...",michael
36303,Is he you?,jim
36304,[laughs] I am flattered. That's Johnny Depp.,michael
36305,Where did you take that?,jim
36306,In my condo complex.,michael
36307,"Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton.",jim
36308,"I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie.",michael
36309,Sure. That they should do one.,jim
36310,"[feigning accent] Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl?",michael
36311,Who's that?,jim
36312,"Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.",michael
36313,John Dillinger.,jim
36314,No. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.,michael
36315,Captain Crunch.,jim
36316,"Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it's not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you'd seen Roger Clemens?",michael
36317,At the Yankees game. Yeah.,jim
36318,"Yeah. Well, it wasn't him.",michael
36319,"I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp...",jim
36320,"I know, I know.",michael
36321,...in your condo complex.,jim
36322,I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.,michael
36323,M. Night Shulman?,jim
36324,"[speaking at a staff meeting] First up, the lost and found has gone missing. It itself is lost, so please, try not to lose anything until we find it. Ah, pet day. If you don't have a pet, please don't feel like -",michael
36326,"Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?",dwight
36327,"Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet. But will be.. [muttering, people rise to leave] No, no, meeting's not over.",michael
36329,No sales topic per se.,michael
36330,Well then no Andy Bernard per se. [Andy and others begin exiting the room],andy
36331,Dwight?,michael
36332,"Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make.",dwight
36333,"I would like your undivided attention, please.",michael
36334,You couldn't handle my undivided attention.,dwight
36335,"Over the last few weeks, things have been changing here. Sabre says it is our duty to support the sales team and the salesmen are letting it go to their heads. I think it's kind of screwed up, because the way this place used to work was: make friends first, make sales second, make love third, in no particular order.",michael
36336,"Listen, Michael - about what happened earlier.",dwight
36337,Yeah.,michael
36338,When I was asking about the leads.,dwight
36339,M-hmm.,michael
36340,... is there any news on the leads?,dwight
36341,Is that all you have to say to me?,michael
36342,"Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone! [leaves office] Alright, Dwight out!",dwight
36343,"Salesman is king. As the best salesman, I am king of kings. Oh, you say Jesus is king of kings? Well. What does that say to you about how I think of myself?",dwight
36346,"Wow, wowie wowie. Congratulations. It's a big cheque. [Jim stands in corner, texting]",michael
36347,"Oh, sorry, wait one second.",jim
36348,Stop sexting Pam. I'm trying to congratulate you.,michael
36349,"This is actually a big potential sale, so...",jim
36350,You writing your memoirs over there?,michael
36351,You writing your name over there?,jim
36352,"Well, it's a pretty big check.",michael
36353,"That's good. You know, with the kid.",jim
36354,Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people.,michael
36355,"Alright, here we go. [taps page] Michael...",jim
36356,"I'm just saying, that -",michael
36357,Michael - [Michael signs] Great.,jim

36360,"Give me that [wrestles with Darryl, Andy falls over chair and to the floor]",andy

36365,You saw who did this and you didn't stop them?,michael
36367,The sales department smashed my sandwich.,michael
36369,You don't get it.,michael
36371,That's what she said.,michael
36373,Yeah.,michael
36375,Thank you very much.,michael
36376,What'd you get?,jim
36377,"Ah, just the stupid leads.",michael
36378,Alright!,jim
36380,Me likey!,andy
36382,"Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you don't. Not even Sabre owns this place. It's a rental. I'm kind of sick of the attitude around here. I'm sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim... I think I am not going to give these to you. [Angela, Kevin and Oscar applaud]",michael
36385,"Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.",michael
36387,They act like I have no power.,michael
36391,"Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that.",michael
36393,Exactly that.,michael
36395,Exactly that.,michael
36397,"Hello. May I have everyone's attention, please? Gabe has instructed me to hand out the leads, so I'm going to give the leads to... King Creed! [hands him a lead]",michael

36405,Hey.,michael
36406,"So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?",jim
36407,Mm-hmm.,michael
36408,"Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls?",jim
36409,Okay. [passes Jim some index cards],michael
36410,"Hey, alright.",jim
36411,Alright.,michael
36412,"Ahh, these aren't leads. What are they?",jim
36413,"Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don't respect the father who doesn't respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?",michael
36414,I don't think you understand -,jim
36415,I do understand it.,michael
36416,[holds up card] This one's a map.,jim
36417,Or is it?,michael
36429,"[over phone] Hey baby, what's up?",pam
36430,I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?,jim
36431,Nothing but vomit and diapers over here.,pam
36432,"Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more.",jim
36433,Having a baby is as exhausting as they say it is. Having two babies [holds up index cards] - that's just unfair.,jim
36434,"How about this one - 'When arrogant salesmen are mean to my face, a certain manager will go to his moppy place.'",jim
36435,"He means his mopey place, it's under that streetlamp that he thinks was in Casablanca.",pam
36436,I love you.,jim
36437,"Today I turned an office crisis into a teachable moment. [cuts to Jim fishing one of the leads out of a catering size tin of Ravioli] A lesser manager would have screwed this day up royally [clue next to Jim reads: 'Now that's Italian!'] Some yokel sitting behind his desk saying take a lead, learn nothing [cut to scenes of chaos as everyone argues] Some people shouldn't be in this business.",michael
36438,Hey. I guess you probably won't give me your leads since I'm a jerk salesman.,andy
36440,Where?,andy
36442,Are you...,andy
36444,Are you sure?,andy
36446,"What are you doing, idiot? [Jim is crouched down, peering under a car]",dwight
36447,Michael's stupid scavenger hunt.,jim
36448,Scavenger hunt? Here. I can solve it. Give it. [grabs card] 'The treasure you seek is in the parking lot under the first president.',dwight
36449,[taps car] Lincoln.,jim
36450,The prankster is getting pranked. Ha ha.,dwight
36451,[holds up the retrieved lead] It involves you too.,jim
36452,The leads are in?,dwight
36453,"Michael? Michael, you were supposed to tell me when the leads came in.",dwight
36454,"Well, bigshot, 'If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'.",michael
36455,"Kevin! Damnit [runs over to Kevin's desk] Kevin, give me those leads. Where are they? C'mon -",dwight
36457,Really.,dwight
36459,[begins to strangle him] Gimme the leads. Where are my leads?,dwight
36461,Where are they?,dwight
36463,"Turn the trash [releases him - Kevin coughs] It's code. Alright, Meredith, take off your dress.",dwight
36467,"[dashes to kitchen, overturns the trash can, tastes the bin liner] Clean sack.",dwight
36471,"[dives into dumpster, rattling noises then he emerges] It's empty!",dwight
36472,Wait. What day is today?,michael
36474,"Oh my god. Oh my god [takes off running] oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey [chases after garbage van] wait, wait!",michael
36475,"Okay. You know what, let's just go to the dump, start looking - Ryan, c'mon, shotgun in my car -",michael
36477,"Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, 'Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they're now in the city dump.'",michael
36479,"Well, that's not the way it's going t sound. Here's what we're going to do. We'll go to the dump, we'll look around, then we'll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you -",michael
36481,Really?,michael
36483,"Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit [looks to Jim for vocab-reassurance] Complicit. You were all successories!",michael
36485,You can.,michael
36487,"Okay fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself.",michael
36488,"I'll go, Michael. You'll just screw it up.",dwight
36489,[looks around dump] This place has gone to hell.,dwight
36490,"You know, Dwight, there was a time when you'd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.",michael
36491,"Yeah, well, the acorn becomes the oak.",dwight
36492,"Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you don't believe me, look in my gutters.",michael
36494,Phew! Can't wait for this day to be over.,jim
36496,Just all the - drama.,jim
36498,"Between the - us and you guys. It's unnecessary, right?",jim
36500,"Oh, good, phew,  thank god you said that.",jim
36502,I have new baby pictures.,jim
36504,"She's wearing a onesie [holds out his cell phone, Oscar leans in but Kelly grabs his arm]",jim
36506,Didn't we kind of start it?,jim
36508,Yeah.,andy
36510,"Can we at least all agree that this is uncomfortable, and may be heading for something bad?",jim
36511,"All those who agree, say aye [all present - Stanley, Andy and Phyllis -  raise their hands] All those opposed -",andy
36512,I don't think we need opposed.,jim
36513,"[kicking through rubbish at the dump] You've changed, man.",michael
36514,"Oh, why, because I have a shot at a $100k commission?",dwight
36515,"Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.",michael
36516,Hey. There is nothing I can do about my wide-set eyes.,dwight
36517,"No, I'm talking about your personality, Dwight.",michael
36518,"When I first met you, I had a lot of job offers. And I had an offer from Ivan Schartsky. The Ivan Schartsky. And if I'd assistant managed him -",dwight
36519,Assistant to the managed him -,michael
36520,"Oh, that's low! I would be number two right now at Home Depot!",dwight
36521,Yeah.,michael
36522,"Okay? Because they promote from within. Instead I had to follow you - you, going nowhere.",dwight
36523,You think you would have done better without me? Really?,michael
36524,I hitched my wagon to a horse with no legs.,dwight
36525,Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldn't have been hanging out watching karate movies with you -,michael
36526,Kung-fu movies!,dwight
36527,"You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies -",michael
36528,Nice babies you're making with the floozies at the bars.,dwight
36529,"That's my wife you're talking about, man.",michael
36530,"Your made-up wife? Who doesn't exist? [Michael picks up a piece of metal and hurls it at Dwight, who sidesteps] You watch it!",dwight
36531,"If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you.",michael
36532,Don't do it [lobs something at Michael],dwight
36533,"No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight. [they throw volleys of rubbish at each other] No, time out, time out. [Michael inspects a box, then hurls it at Dwight] Time in!",michael
36534,No! [lunges for a large wooden spool],dwight
36535,"Don't even think about that [Dwight begins rolling it towards Michael, as he reaches him Dwight kicks it and falls backward. The spool comes to a halt in front of Michael, and Michael pushes it towards Dwight.]",michael
36536,"[kicks spool] Stop it, get out! That's my spool.",dwight
36538,I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff.,jim
36539,And I'll text Erin. She's really good at this stuff too.,andy
36542,Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.,jim
36544,"Alright. Then we're back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I'm for it.",jim
36546,Erin just texted me back. 'People love shells from far-away beaches'.,andy
36547,"Okay, Dwight. Here we go [picks up a sink, spills dump juice on his pants] oh god.",michael
36548,Oh [half-heartedly throws something],dwight
36549,"We're never going to find those leads, are we? [they both sit on the edge of a claw-footed bathtub]",michael
36550,"[surveys the mountains of trash surrounding them] Wow. Amazing, isn't it. No other animal on earth could do this. Maybe beavers. But not like this.",dwight
36552,"No, we agreed, two percent for the quarter. Okay [others enter] Hey everybody!",jim
36554,"No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel is: really sorry.",jim
36555,Yeah. We wanted to bring you in and make a peace offering.,andy
36560,Yes! We do. [opens box] Eclairs.,jim
36562,- two percent milk! What I forgot for the coffee.,jim
36565,This [picks up racquet] Why would somebody throw that out?,michael
36566,"Hey [holds up an old sweater] You know who'd like this? Phyllis. Purple, much?",dwight
36567,"Yeah, she does - she loves purple. [Dwight sniffs it] Does it stink?",michael
36568,Yeah [puts it back in the bath tub],dwight
36569,"Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. That's it. And the caption would read:",michael

36949,[gets up and starts to walk to Oscar's desk] Is that the program where all those puppets live in the barrio?,dwight
36951,I love that show.,dwight
36955,"That is an amusing link. I'd like it sent to me, please.",dwight
36961,"It's Secretary's Day. And it is Erin's and my three-week anniversary. So perfect storm for a romantic gesture. [Andy unfurling a giant 'Happy Secretary's Day' banner by reception, placing a teddy bear on Erin's chair]. Want to make sure the whole office remembers it's Secretary's Day. I sent an e-mail blast, a text blast, a good, old-fashioned talk blast. I sent a snail mail blast a week ago.  And a Stern reminder via fax at 7:00 this morning, so people better step up and appreciate the crap out of Erin.",andy
36964,I do.,andy
36965,[hands Erin a basket of beets],dwight
36967,"If it wasn't for secretaries, I wouldn't have a stepmom.",andy
36969,"Hey, thanks.",pam
36970,"It's my first day back after maternity leave. And I miss Cece, of course. But we need the money. What was maternity leave like? Oh, how do I explain it?... It rocked. It rocked my ass off.",pam
36971,"[at her desk, grabs her plant and sees it dried up, looks at Jim] Oh. You couldn't have watered it?",pam
36972,I literally did not know that existed until this moment.,jim
36973,"Well, I knew it existed, and I chose to let it die.",dwight
36974,"It's nice to see you again, Dwight.",pam
36975,"Hello, Pam.",dwight
36976,[arrives at Michael's office and sits] I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary's Day.,andy
36977,I'm going to give Erin $15.,michael
36979,A one-on-one lunch with Erin?,michael
36980,"Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there's only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary's Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. [Michael glances over at Erin in reception, Erin waves her teddy bear's arm at Michael].",andy
36981,She's kind of a rube.,michael
36982,[slams his hand on Michael's desk] That's my girlfriend you're talking about.,andy
36983,Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I'll take her to lunch.,michael
36984,[taping desk] She's gonna be so psyched.,andy
36985,"[walks over to Erin's desk] Hi, Erin. Happy Secretary's Day.",michael
36987,I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to...[Erin snaps a picture of Michael] lunch.,michael
36989,Ugh.,michael
36991,"Well, Hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I'm...",michael
36993,"Okay, well, we'll figure something. [Michael turns and starts back toward his office]",michael
36995,"[looks at Andy who is urging he agree with her, Michael turns around] Okay, let's go to Hayworth's.",michael
36997,All right.,michael
37016,[in his car with Erin driving to lunch] Would you mind if I listen to my book on tape? I'm kind of a bookworm. This is the novelization of the movie Precious based on the book Push by Sapphire.,michael
37018,"[shakes head, annoyed] I don't know.",michael
37020,Ahhh.,michael
37022,Right. [sighs],michael
37024,An age or month?,michael
37026,I've been trying. I've been trying to keep it going. Erin is just weird.,michael
37028,So how are things going with Andy?,michael
37030,"Well, let's see. Um... Andy. Plays the banjo.",michael
37032,"Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don't think he is a snappy dresser.",michael
37034,I don't think he is the best dresser.  Reminds me of Easter.,michael
37036,Mm-hmm. You didn't know that? Oh.,michael
37038,Okay.,michael
37041,I don't know. Probably didn't want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else.,michael
37043,"They were engaged, so... [Erin looks shocked] Okay, you know what, sir?",michael
37045,"Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?",michael
37047,Thank you.,michael
37049,Mm-hmm. Yeah.,michael
37051,Well...,michael
37053,What are you doing? What are you doing?,michael
37055,"Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now.",michael
37057,[turns to other restaurant patrons] I'll have what she's having!,michael
37058,[in Michael's car] Did you have a... did you like your lunch? Did you have a good lunch? Did you like that? Did you enjoy your food? It was good. I liked my lunch.,michael
37059,[feels a pain in her breast] Ooh. Ah-ah-ah. Ha-ha.,pam
37060,What's up?,jim
37061,Her milk is coming in. She's getting uncomfortable.,dwight
37062,"Dwight, don't be gross.",jim
37063,"No, no, he's right.",pam
37064,"Same thing happens with my cows if I don't tend them frequently enough. You gotta milk them, or else they'll moo like crazy.",dwight
37065,"That's weird, my breast pump is missing. Have you seen my breast pump?",pam
37066,"[removes jacket, applies hand sanitizer] All right, this is gonna traumatize me a hell of a lot more than you, believe me.",dwight
37067,"You know what, Dwight? Let me just check the bathroom first. Okay?",pam
37068,Really? Fine. Let your breasts explode. Three squeezes and I would drain you.,dwight
37069,"Mm. [walks into bathroom, Meredith is using her brest pump] Meredith!",pam
37071,What are you doing?!,pam
37073,Relax?!,pam
37075,Give it back to me now.,pam
37077,It's disgusting!,pam
37079,It's not sterile!,pam
37081,So... how was lunch?,andy
37083,Was it everything that you hoped and dreamed it might be?,andy
37085,"Well, I know. [stammers] Just want... I mean... [chuckles]",andy
37092,Jim does a really good one. Do yours.,pam
37093,"Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. 'Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall.'",jim
37095,"Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies.'",jim
37097,"Hey. Can I have your attention please? First of all, thanks to everyone for helping put this awesome party together. And a very special shout-out to the chair of the Party Planning Committee, miss Angela Martin. You have outdone yourself.",andy
37098,"You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so..",michael
37099,I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic.,andy
37100,No. No. No.,michael
37101,Specific shout-out..,andy
37102,Stop talking.,michael
37103,"Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretary's Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend... in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote [starts to use a British accent] a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. It's a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three..",andy
37105,Oh God.,michael
37106,Can we talk about this in private?,andy
37108,Yes.,andy
37110,"No, no never.",pam
37112,Yeah pretty much.,dwight
37118,"[imitating Cookie Monster] 'Hey, Erin, You look delicious. I mean, beautiful.'",pam
37120,"What? What do you mean, suspend me?",pam
37121,I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.,jim
37123,"Wait, What? I was just slow-clapping your no-nonsense decision-making.",dwight
37126,Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary's Day?,andy
37127,"Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.",michael
37128,"I was going to tell her, just on my own time.",andy
37129,"You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret.",michael
37130,"Who cares? I mean it's not like I killed someone. Big deal right? This can blow over in two seconds. She never asked me. So, if you think about it... I probably should have told her I guess. Everybody does stupid things.",andy
37139,Hey. You know I was engaged before Jim.,pam
37141,Yeah. And he worked here too.,pam
37143,"No, no it wasn't Andy. It wasn't. It doesn't matter. It's not about who you've been with. It's about who you end up with. Sometimes the heart doesn't know what it wants until it finds what it wants.",pam
37145,Thank you. [kisses Jim on the cheek],pam
37147,[answers phone] Hey Toby.,pam
37149,Very interesting.,pam
37151,[Gabe walks in] Thanks Toby.,pam
37153,I don't think an apology is enough. I really think the only way for me to learn my lesson is to take my suspension.,pam
37154,"And I got to take this bad attitude, and I got to go home, and I got to adjust it. And I hope the suspension does that.",jim
37155,"[gets up and walks towards Gabe] Prideful idiots. Watch how it's done. [Jim and Pam get their things together and start to leave] Gabriel, I apologize.",dwight
37157,[gets on one knee] I kneel before you.,dwight
37159,Humbly taking your hand upon which I kiss to show my contrition.,dwight
37162,"Will you stop walking for one second? That's it. There's no other secrets. Ok? I mean yeah, my chest is not naturally hairless, and my parents pay my credit card bill.",andy
37164,A year.,andy
37166,Yeah but that's it. Now you know everything about me. I promise. And if I think of anything else...,andy
37168,I didn't see that movie.,andy
37175,What was that? Are you kidding me? Was that an impression?,dwight
37179,I have to go back to the zoo to the stick insect exhibit.',dwight
37183,Erin?,michael
37185,"No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?",michael
37187,Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel... I'm sorry I caused that thing.,michael
37189,"Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn't worry about Angela. She doesn't hold a candle to you, Erin. She's old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she's, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don't think she's ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis.",michael
37191,You said butt.,michael
37193,"Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him: 'Hey! Hey Scott!'",michael
37194,"Sometimes telling someone something is hard. Well, at least someone made her happy on Secretary's Day.",andy
37198,"Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.",jim
37199,Yeah. 'I vant to count to ten'.,pam
37203,That would have been funny.,pam
37205,"[walking up] Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? 'Oscar. I am the Count.' Nailed him. Nailed him. [Gives Kevin a fist pump] Good work Cookie Monster.",michael
37207,"Buenos dias, Erin.",michael
37209,"No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor.",michael
37210,"I believe that every man, woman, and child in this country should learn how to speak Spanish. They are our neighbors to the South, and this would be a healing thing for... for all of North America. And... I am going on vacation next week to Cancun.",michael
37211,"Buenos dias, Jaime.",michael
37212,"Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa?",jim
37213,"Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!",michael
37214,"Guten tag, Herr Michael.",dwight
37215,"I don't understand why Michael is wasting his time with Spanish. I have it on very good authority that within 20 years, everyone will be speaking German. Or a Chinese-German hybrid.",dwight
37216,La telefona.,michael
37220,"[clears throat] Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!",michael
37222,"Damn it. [knock on door] Ah, Angelo.",michael
37224,Yo soy Cancun.,michael
37226,"All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee.",jim
37227,"You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like, [vaudeville delivery] 'I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee.'",pam
37228,"Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.",jim
37229,Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.,michael
37230,"You know what? I should be getting this client, Michael. My numbers are better than either of theirs.",dwight
37231,I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.,michael
37232,"If you want people to put the best face on something, why would you get two people who probably never cut the face off of anything in their lives?",dwight
37233,[whispers] That's a good point.,jim
37234,This is our first joint sales pitch. I think we're gonna work really well together.,pam
37235,Yeah I think we have complimentary strengths. We understand each other.,jim
37236,"We have good give and take. [vaudeville delivery] I give, he takes.",pam
37237,[whispering] I don't even know who you are anymore.,jim
37238,[vaudeville delivery] Yee.,pam
37240,"Oh, hey, Miss Newton. Hi, I'm Jim.",jim
37242,How are you?,jim
37243,Did somebody order a hooker over here?,michael
37245,Hi. How are you?,michael
37246,"There's this woman I met a few weeks ago. Her name is Donna, the manager of Sid & Dexter's and, right now, we're in the midst of a passionate love affair. Um, no. But she is coming by today. Maybe to buy some printers, so...",michael
37247,"Right here, we have the wonder twins, Jim and Pam Halpert. They will be assisting you today.",michael
37249,"Oh, no we're actually married. We're not brother and sister.",pam
37251,All right.,jim
37254,"[explaining PowerPoint to Donna] So, yes, laser printers are more expensive. But they cost less to operate [knocking] So it's a tradeoff.",jim
37255,[barges in] Hi.,michael
37256,Hold on one second.,jim
37257,"Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret?",michael
37258,What?,jim
37259,Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.,michael
37260,None of this is time sensitive.,jim
37261,"Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.",michael
37263,"Okay, I have more of them.",michael
37266,What is this?,dwight
37268,"It doesn't just sound a'ight, it sounds amazing.",dwight
37270,How do I apply?,dwight
37272,"Uh, glasses wearers. Cholera survivors. Geniuses. Non-organic family farmers. The list goes on and on. You want me to keep going?",dwight
37274,Come here. Come here.,dwight
37276,"Ten seconds ago, this guy was driving a forklift. Okay? Now all off a sudden he's Cinderella of the office. What are you guys thinking?",dwight
37279,"One minority from this branch is going to get into this program. Who would I refer? Hmm... the competent, hardworking one who does things his own way, or the malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines?",dwight
37281,"Oh, man. White people, right?",dwight
37283,"Well, you can kinda tell from the voice.",dwight
37285,"I bet you get pulled over by the cops a lot, just because of your race.",dwight
37287,I think you should consider applying for the executive minority training program.,dwight
37289,"I know, 'cause you have no role models. How many Indian CEO's can you think of?",dwight
37291,You could be the Indian Bill Gates. You could be the Indian Ted Turner.,dwight
37293,That's not... she's... okay. Yes.,dwight
37294,"I took the liberty to scan a few things earlier, and I want to show you... there we go! [Michael's picture pops up on the PowerPoint screen] Whoa, look at those vivid colors. Look at my eyes. Those are Shrek-green eyes. That is me again. I think this displays the crisp, dazzling white.",michael
37296,"And that would be a display [image from a catalog of a man wearing only white boxers pops up] of the crisp, gorgeous black.",michael
37298,"It's subtle. That's how it works. I show her an image that turns her on. 	And then she looks at me, then back at me, then back at the image. Soon, she doesn't know what is me, what is the image. She just knows that she's turned on.",michael
37299,This is a place that I like to go to be alone with my thoughts. I've never taken anybody there before.,michael
37301,Ryan.,michael
37303,And that's it. That's me. That's who I am.,michael
37305,"Oh, thanks. [softly] You're not bad, either.",michael
37307,Hmm.,michael
37309,Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?,michael
37310,"[in his office] You didn't see it, Pam. She was giving me all sorts of signals that she wanted me to make a move. Shortbread?",michael
37311,No.,jim
37312,I'll have one.,pam
37313,"Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work.",jim
37314,"Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.",michael
37315,"Okay. Well, all that is irrelevant.",jim
37316,"Maybe Michael has a point. I mean, if she was really that upset, she wouldn't still be here.",pam
37318,"Look, I know that I screwed up in there. I know that I probably messed up your sale. I just want to go in and fix it.",michael
37319,What if I back out and you finish the pitch with Jim?,pam
37320,What?,jim
37321,What was that?,jim
37322,Just let him flirt with her. People meet each other all sorts of ways.,pam
37323,"Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale.",jim
37324,Who cares? [Michael peeking at them through his office window] It's not that huge a sale.,pam
37325,"Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat every sale like it was a huge sale.",jim
37326,"Don't act like you understood anything that guy said. [pat's Jim's arm] Good luck, wingman. [salutes]",pam
37327,How as being a minority affected you?,dwight
37329,"Oh, good, and you resent this because...",dwight
37331,"Oh, no, no. That's not dorky. [Dwight wears his phone like that] Look, it's easily accessible. Boom, like this. 911, hello. Scranton Strangler's in the house. Inside the house.",dwight
37338,Maybe she's just pushing her breasts together to make them look bigger.,pam
37341,"Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility.",jim
37343,Yeah. [chuckles],jim
37344,"So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?",michael
37345,What's that?,jim
37346,Maybe wee find some wiggle room?,michael
37347,I don't... I don't think so.,jim
37348,I think we could. [Donna giggles],michael
37350,"Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.",michael
37352,Why don't you run them again?,michael
37353,What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?,jim
37354,"If she is, it's working.",michael
37356,She does not like him.,jim
37357,You can flirt with someone to get what you want and also be attracted to them. How do you think we got together?,pam
37358,cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.,jim
37359,I was after your money.,pam
37360,"Well, the joke was on you.",jim
37361,"Yes, it was.",pam
37364,Hey... what are you guys doing?,dwight
37368,"You know, we really should keep practicing for this interview.",dwight
37370,Ryan? What does he know?,dwight
37373,We?',dwight
37376,"Kelly will be even worse than Darryl. If you'd have told me this morning that today I'd be creating a monster capable f my own destruction, I 'd have thought you were referring to the bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.",dwight
37377,So corporate approval of this contract is contingent upon buyer and seller...,michael
37379,Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish. [Donna laughing] Just kidding. Do you like mints?,michael
37381,I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?,michael
37383,They're good [Donna grabs mint],michael
37385,Sure.,michael
37387,I can't stop myself from kissing her.,michael
37389,"Well, why don't you just move the M&M's?",andy
37391,"Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time.",michael
37392,It is totally insane.,jim
37394,Okay. What do you think?,michael
37396,Andy?,michael
37397,Ehh.,andy
37398,"Okay, some for, some against.",michael
37399,Nobody's for.,jim
37400,Pam?,michael
37401,Hmm?,pam
37403,"Um... I think it's really, really unlikely.",pam
37404,Okay.,jim
37405,Really unlikely. But I can't say that it's impossible.,pam
37406,What?,jim
37407,"I'm not saying she's in love with him. But she could have left a while ago. Most printer sales are done over the phone, Ms. Boob shirt.",pam
37408,I'm going with Pam's group.,michael
37409,Wait.,jim
37410,Here we go.,michael
37411,Michael. Michael.,jim
37412,Okay.,michael
37413,Michael.,jim
37414,"No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just... thank you for talking. Wish me luck.",michael
37415,No.,jim
37416,"What sort of movie would Rudy have been if he had just stopped, given up, after two rejections? Would have been a lot shorter. Probably been a lot funnier. But it would have ultimately been a disappointment. I still would have seen it, but that's not... the point.",michael
37417,Kelly is disqualified!,dwight
37419,"You said the program is not open to Caucasians. Well... anthropologically, she is Indian. Indians migrated from the caucuses region of Europe. Therefore, technically, she is Caucasian. You're welcome, America.",dwight
37421,"Well, obviously, she is brownish. But come on, I mean, Darryl is far more ethnic.",dwight
37424,Kelly is the only applicant.,dwight
37427,"Oh, dear God. Okay. Don't make any decisions just yet. Okay? I'll be right back.",dwight
37433,We should have your contract done by Thursday.,michael
37435,Okay.,michael
37437,"Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.",michael
37439,I don't know. I think so.,michael

37450,All right. All right. Bye.,michael
37452,And have a good elevator ride.,michael
37454,"Oh, what's that out there?",michael
37456,How would one of you feel if I told you I could put you on a fast track to an executive position at this company?,dwight
37458,"I wasn't talking to you, pale-face.",dwight
37460,What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet train straight to middle management.,dwight
37462,Yes.,dwight
37465,"Speaking of rainbows, Oscar... you are kind of a double minority. Gay. So we at Sabre could really benefit from your perspective.",dwight
37467,I can protect you from Kelly. [Erin stifles laugh] Will you get out of here? Seriously. [Erin turns and leaves kitchen],dwight
37469,"Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is Hide Toshi Hasagawa. He would like to apply for the Sabre minority executive training program 'print in all colors' initiative.",dwight

37479,I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore.,michael
37480,"You know what, Michael? For what it's worth... I was wrong, too. I thought she was interested in you.",pam
37481,She suckered you too.,michael
37482,Mm-hmm.,pam
37483,Was it the cleavage?,michael
37484,"Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts.",pam
37485,Yep.,michael
37487,"You know, when I tore my scrote, I was, uh... I was seeing this really hot urologist about it, and thought she was into me. But now I think she was just doing a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO. You know, she's touching around down there. It's easy to get confused.",andy
37489,God. She left this here?,michael
37491,Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.,michael
37492,What?,jim
37494,Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off.,michael
37496,Michael...,pam
37497,[hold up barrette] Well...,michael
37498,She doesn't want you to return the barrette. She's not interested in you.,pam
37499,"Yeah, I know. I know.",michael
37500,I'm sorry.,pam
37501,"I know. You're right. Thank you. Thanks everybody. [waves, returns to his office, clears throat, turns around and runs out of office]",michael
37502,Michael! [sighs],pam
37503,"[runs down to parking lot, sighs]",michael
37505,Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette.,michael
37512,"Hey, kiddo. Congratulations are in order. You deserve it. [Dwight extends his hand, but Kelly hugs him]",dwight
37514,Oh.,dwight
37516,Gosh. He he.,dwight
37518,"Just once, I would like to be a puppet master and have nothing go wrong. Is that too much to ask?",dwight
37519,You know what? Everybody told me that you weren't interested. Everybody. And I didn't believe 'em. And they were right. So... there's your barrette.,michael
37521,Who?,michael
37523,About what?,michael
37525,"No, no. No.",michael
37527,No... [they kiss again],michael
37528,[returns to office] What happened?,michael
37530,"Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it! [all look at him] I kissed. We kissed.",michael
37533,"No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette [holds up barrette] We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did.",michael
37534,You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I know it happened. And that is all that counts. [shouts] I did do it!,michael
37535,Stop it!,dwight
37536,Stop what?,jim
37537,"You're talking about me in Morse Code. Well, you know what? Joke's on you 'cause I know Morse Code. Ha!",dwight
37538,"[chuckles] Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.",jim
37539,Yup. That's exactly what we did.,jim
37540,"It all started when Dwight was tapping his foot against the leg of his desk. When I asked him to stop, he said, 'I will when you lose the baby weight.'",pam
37541,Very well. I must have imagined it. I apologize. [Pam clacking her stapler and Jim responding with tapping his keyboard rhythmically] Detonator. Detonator where? Michael!,dwight
37542,Jim. Are you clicking a detonator?,michael
37543,It's a pen.,jim
37544,"Michael, come on.",dwight
37545,"Get back to work, Dwight. Please.",michael
37546,Fine. [clears throat] Hey. Tap away. [Dwight puts noise-cancelling headphones on and Pam and Jim begin to blink rhythmically],dwight
37547,"Ooh! Things with Donna are so... oh-ho-ho! They're going great. I, uh... we're just clicking on every level. Emotionally and sexually and... orally and I am not used to relationships going this well. I'm actually having trouble focusing on my job. And I like it!",michael
37548,"Who enjoys the weekends? [all raise hands] Of course. Now the weekend is always great if you have someone, which I do. I have Donna. She is hot. She has a Pilates butt. But we need to find something to do this weekend beside have sex. Did I say that? Yes, I did. [all nod] And the reason you are here is that I need ideas for things that Donna and I could do on the weekend.  So just shout it out.",michael
37550,Okay.,michael
37552,"Okay, you get out of here, big dog. [high-fives Stanley] Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.",michael
37553,Stanley got to go.,pam
37554,"Yeah, well, Stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out.",michael
37555,Walk around apple orchards.,andy
37556,Oh!,michael
37557,Super romantic.,andy
37558,That's fun.,michael
37559,Eel fishing.,dwight
37560,All right.,michael
37563,"We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang's.",michael
37565,"Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, 'I wanna go to Mount Pocono,' you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.",michael
37567,"You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World: Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see.",michael
37569,You guys think Donna's cheating on me?,michael
37570,"No, Michael, no.",pam
37571,Are you nuts?,dwight
37572,You had a nice meal with your girlfriend in a lovely place...,pam
37573,"... and... we had sex, too.",michael
37574,That is right. Don't make any more of it.,pam
37575,How?,michael
37576,How what?,pam
37577,How do I not make any more of it?,michael
37578,You could start by concluding this meeting.,pam
37579,"All right.  [all stand up to leave] And she won't say, 'I love you.'",michael
37580,"Oh, no.",dwight
37581,How many dates have you been on?,andy
37582,Nine dates. I said it on the second date.,michael
37583,Mm.,andy
37587,"Yeah, she does all that.",michael
37589,"No, no...",michael
37590,"Michael, do not let your imagination run amok.",pam
37591,Run what?,michael
37592,"Amok. It means, don't let your imagination run out of control.",pam
37593,"Why didn't you just say that, Pam?",michael
37594,"Michael, do not let your imagination run out of control.",pam
37595,"Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world.",michael
37596,You do?,jim
37597,"Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.",michael
37598,But you didn't believe any of this was true five minutes ago.,jim
37599,That's what makes it so wrong.,michael
37600,"Ever since I found out that Donna might be cheating on me, I have not eaten or slept. This not knowing, that's what's killing me.",michael
37601,"Oh, God, that tickles. What did...",dwight
37602,[whispers] I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.,michael
37603,I think I've got one for you. [hands Michael a business card],dwight
37604,This is you. How much do you charge?,michael
37605,"$100 a day, plus expenses.",dwight
37606,I'll give you $50. Money's no object.,michael
37607,I'm just gonna warn you... and I say this to all my clients... you might not like what I find.,dwight
37608,Okay.,michael
37609,"And you might not like how I find it. [slides over table, leaves]",dwight
37610,"Of course. Yeah, that's terrible. Okay, let me get back to you. Hey, Stanley. One of my clients just called and said that their Sabre printer started smoking and caught on fire.",andy
37612,"Hey, Gabe I need to talk to you about something. It's really important.",andy
37614,"Yeah, I don't know. Look, one of my clients called. He was in the middle of a big printing job and the back of the printer started smoking and then the paper tray caught on fire.",andy
37616,What are we gonna do about this?,andy
37618,Let me know what they say.,andy
37620,What do you mean?,andy
37622,I don't know.,andy
37625,[sitting on his Firebird's hood in front of a gym] Hi stranger.,dwight
37627,I work with Michael.,dwight
37629,Dwight Schrute. [they shake hands],dwight
37631,"All cases are solved with logic. The only logical way to find out if Donna Is a cheater is to seduce her, bring her to orgasm, then call Michael and tell him the sad news.",dwight
37632,"That's interesting. Wow, it's a little early for ice cream, don't you think?",jim
37633,"It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.",michael
37634,Oh!...,pam
37635,"Oh, my God",jim
37636,"It's comfort food, all right? [disgustedly] God.",michael
37637,"You know Michael, this whole Donna thing is gonna be okay, you just... stop beating yourself up.",jim
37638,"I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what Dwight says.",michael
37639,Why do we have to see what Dwight says?,pam
37640,Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update.,michael
37641,"Michael, no...",jim
37642,"No, no, no, no. Undo that. Undo that.",pam
37643,It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.,michael
37644,"Michael. Okay, I'm... I'm going to talk straight to you because I think you need to hear it. Michael.",pam
37645,"God, this is so disgusting.",michael
37646,Stop eating it! Do you wanna be happy? Look at you. You have a major self-destructive streak in you.,pam
37647,I know.,michael
37648,And you kind of torpedo every romantic relationship you're in.,pam
37649,"That's not true. [Pam stares him down] You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.",michael
37650,Helene.,pam
37651,Helene?,michael
37652,My mother.,pam
37653,Oh.,michael
37654,"My mother, Helene. [Jim shakes his head]",pam
37655,"Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.",michael
37656,"You should stop this, [pulls away mayo and olives bowl] and you should call Dwight right now.",jim
37657,[sighs] All right. [calls Dwight],michael
37658,"[at gym, looks ready to work out, checks phone, and tries to grab Donna's attention] Oh, gosh, we were both going for the same weight at the same time; you go ahead.",dwight
37660,"It's all yours. [strains loudly to lift two dumbbells and a free weight chained to strap around his head] Ah! [after first rep, Dwight is injured]",dwight
37662,"Yeah, I'm good. Hey, you know an exercise for two people that uses the whole body?",dwight
37664,Tractor pulling. Too bad there's not a tractor here.,dwight
37665,[moaning loudly on exercise machine while staring at Donna who's next to him] Oh. Oh. Oh. [groans loudly] One thing you need to know about me. I don't quit until something tears or pops. [chuckles] You look like you're getting a good workout. Can I feel your pulse?,dwight
37667,"Really? Hey, um... [Dwight gets up and walks sorely from his 'workout']",dwight
37669,Get out of my way. Huh!,dwight
37670,"Tomorrow's fertilizer, am I right?",dwight
37672,"Donna. Donna, wait, please. I'm sorry. Okay? Listen. We both know why I'm here: to see... you... naked... while... I'm... naked.",dwight
37674,"Donna, come... Ah! Grr! Ugh! [Dwight is very sore from his 'workout' and cannot chase Donna]",dwight
37675,You're back. What happened?,michael
37676,"Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.",dwight
37677,"No, what happened with Donna?",michael
37678,"Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here. [near his groin]",dwight
37679,Ugh!,michael
37680,Put your fingers here.,dwight
37681,No. No! Are you sure?,michael
37682,"I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there.",dwight
37683,Who eats eight protein bars?,michael
37684,People who don't trust egg whites.,dwight
37685,"Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.",michael
37686,"Oh, me too. And by the way, uh, I told her not to, but she's coming over here and she's furious.",dwight
37687,"What? No, she didn't say that.",michael
37688,"You're right. I was paraphrasing. What she actually said was, [pulls out notebook] 'What is with him? He is crazy. I'm coming over there to talk to him.' And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office.",dwight
37689,I am not paying for that membership.,michael
37690,"[sitting on the floor behind Erin's desk, sighs] Ohhh... mmm...",michael
37692,"No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?",michael
37694,That's her?,michael
37696,"Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right. [Michael pretends to be speaking on the phone as Donna approaches] Okay, I'll talk to you later.",michael
37698,I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.,michael
37700,"Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.",michael
37702,"If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.",michael
37704,"Well, you are boner-ific. [Donna laughs]",michael
37706,...poop my pants.,michael
37708,"Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?",michael
37710,We are?,michael
37712,What's up? I got your e-mail.,andy
37714,Okay.,andy
37717,Such as?,andy
37719,What? You don't know what it meant? How about 'Andy is a problem and we must eliminate him?',andy
37721,[chuckles nervously] Yeah. Hah. Hoo.,andy
37732,[to Pam] What?,jim
37733,Hmm? Oh. It's probably nothing.,pam
37734,"Okay, heart-shaped jewelry is not something that a woman buys for herself. A man definitely bought it for her recently, and it wasn't Michael.",pam
37735,"Wait, so are you... you like heart-shaped jewelry, though, right?",jim
37736,No. Except for the pendant that you bought me. Which I love.,pam
37738,Creed's head of quality assurance. So he'd definitely be wrapped up in this.,andy
37740,"So it turns out Donna and I have a facebook friend of a friend in common, so I was able to see some of her pictures online. [pulls out picture of Donna embracing a man and smiling] This was taken two weeks ago. And this was taken the same night. [pulls out a picture of Donna kissing the same man] This photo was taken this morning. [shows a baby picture] It's Cece. [laughs] She's never gonna do anything wrong.",pam
37742,Wow. [Pam knocks on Michaels door and goes in] That's exciting.,michael
37743,"Hey, Michael.",pam
37744,Hey.,michael
37745,"I'm sorry to interrupt you. Um, I actually have something very important to talk to you about, business related.",pam
37746,Well it can wait. It can wait.,michael
37747,I lied it's personal. It's about me and Jim. We're... I just... you're the only person I can talk to.,pam
37748,Jim is her husband.,michael
37750,And...,pam
37751,"And they are having problems, so sh...",michael
37752,"No, not... we're not... we're not having problems. But it is personal. And I would love...",pam
37753,Good in bed.,michael
37754,"Yes. Yes, I desperately want to speak with you about my sex life with Jim.",pam
37755,"Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?",michael
37756,[loudly] I need you to sign this! So bad!,pam
37757,"Okay, weirdo.",michael
37758,I love [leans over Michael's desk to look at his computer screen]... this idea is neat. I've never been. It sounds lovely. [meanwhile Michael looks at the pictures Pam printed out],pam
37760,"[to Michael] You're gonna wanna look at the date on that.  Oh, wow. Look at... golfing. [to Donna] Are you a golfer?",pam
37762,"Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?",michael
37763,Absolutely. [both leave Michael's office],pam
37766,Your text said 911.,andy
37769,What's bad?,andy
37772,"Oh, God.",andy
37774,"I might have to go public here, but no one's gonna believe me. Uh... I need proof. I need, like, a printer to catch on fire.",andy
37776,Yeah.,andy
37778,There what is?,andy
37780,Who the hell is this? Who is this guy?,michael
37781,I don't know who he is.,pam
37782,God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?,michael
37783,What?,pam
37784,"I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to kill him.",michael
37785,You just have to go in there. You have to hear it from her.,pam
37786,I have to hear it from her.,michael
37787,You have to settle down first.,pam
37788,I need to have her tell me herself. Right?,michael
37789,Okay. Okay. Yes.,pam
37790,I need to have her say...,michael
37791,"Yeah, but you have to calm...",pam
37792,"I need to say, 'What the hell is that? What the hell is that?'",michael
37793,"Okay. Look at this, look at this. Baby picture.",pam
37794,"No, God! No, no, oh, my God!",michael
37795,"[in baby voice] Hi, Michael, hi, Michael",pam
37796,[calms down] Okay. Okay. Okay.,michael
37798,You know what? We should really do something fun this week.,michael
37800,Wouldn't that be fun?,michael
37802,How about Thursday?,michael
37804,I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?,michael
37806,"Oh, really? 'cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It'd be a great, great concert.",michael
37808,"Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by.",michael
37810,"Nope, that's Tuesday.",michael
37812,You're cheating. You're cheating on me.,michael
37814,"Pam told me. [looks up at 2nd floor windows and so does Donna; Jim, Dwight, and Pam are visible on conference room window, they all scramble as soon as Donna and Michael look up, Pam throwing herself on the floor]",michael
37815,[gasps] Did she see me?,pam
37816,[to Pam on floor] Nice effort.,jim
37817,"[in old Michael Scott Paper Company's 'office'] We're printing on 24-pound premium stock paper, approximately 300 sheets in. So far, no signs of distress. [Darryl is filming Andy's demonstration]",andy

37821,Higher? Okay. [speaking slightly higher] Recently certain events have come to my attention...,andy
37823,Make it higher? Okay.,andy
37825,[high-pitched] I have come to the conclusion that the Sabre corporation...,andy
37827,[higher] May be overlooking certain safety regulations. At the danger... [printer starts smoking and explodes] ah! [speaking lower] It's working. [in normal voice] It's... I knew it!,andy
37829,"We are blowin' the roof off! Blowin' the roof off! [Darryl discharges fire extinguisher onto printer] Nice. Nice. This is my partner, Darryl Philbin. He's been my partner through this entire thing.",andy

37833,The other man. Who's the guy? Who is it?,michael
37835,I'm the mistress?,michael

37840,No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side.,dwight
37842,"If they catch us, they will rape us. Go for the cliff. And three, two, one... jump! No! [points to those around him] You're dead, you're dead, you're dead. Good jump. You're barely alive. Okay, now nice cooldown. Check your pulse rate.",dwight
37844,"Toby has been leaving radon kits everywhere, like he owns the place.  The first time I threw mine away, I thought it was an ant trap. [finds radon kit in between his blinds in his office] But I figured I'd rather live with ants than with his creepy little disc. [throws it away] The second time... I thought it was one of those, you know, those things you turn over and it moos. [finds another radon kit on top of his cabinet] Like a cow thing. But upon closer examination, it was another ant trap, so I threw it away. And the third time... I did it out of spite.

37845,Pfffffttt.,michael
37847,"You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?",michael
37849,"You know what? We're not gonna die of radon, we're gonna die of boredom.",michael
37851,"Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.",michael
37853,That's... not okay.,jim
37854,"Okay, alright.",michael
37855,"You were being really funny, and then you went too far.",dwight
37856,I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.,michael

37865,"Stanley, please, this is serious!",jim
37867,"Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle.",michael
37868,"Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do it:  You line them all up, you take one bullet, shoot them all through the throat at the same time. Watch this.

37877,[reading flavors] Despera-dough. Witchy-womanilla. Why do they do this?,pam
37879,"No, no, no, it's fine. I was just commenting. We gotta get these out, open 'em up.",pam

37902,That's awesome. You want some ice cream?,pam
37903,"Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles' flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That's my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?",michael

37920,No secret crying. Hasn't even opened the tissue box in there.,andy

37923,So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?,jim
37924,"Well, it happened to Tom Hanks in Big.",andy
37925,Exactly. It happened in Big.,jim
37926,"No, I gotta go. Text me later.",michael
37927,I'm really too tired to do this.,jim
37928,Me too!,pam
37929,Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?,jim
37930,Hey Michael.,pam
37931,Hey.,michael
37932,"We were wondering if you would like to have dinner with us tonight, in our home, and play with our baby.",pam
37933,We can order in from Hooters.,jim
37934,"Oh, Hooters to go. Nice.",michael
37935,We can watch a movie and play Rock Band.,pam
37936,Billy Joel Rock Band.,jim
37937,That... exists?,michael
37938,Yes.,pam
37939,"Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.",michael
37940,"[shouts] Michael Scott, are you still seeing Donna?",pam
37941,"Okay, Pam... she's not invisible so stop asking silly questions.",michael
37943,Since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?,michael
37944,"I like Donna. Is it wrong to keep seeing her? Depends on who you ask. I mean, if you ask her husband... or you took a random poll, yeah, it's wrong.",michael
37946,"Well, I think we all know what you're capable of Meredith.",michael
37949,"People, this is Scranton. And many people consider that to be the Paris of northeastern Pennsylvania. And in Paris, it is rude for a woman to have less than four lovers.",michael
37952,"I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.",michael
37953,How does he feel about it?,andy
37954,He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out. [points to Andy] It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.,michael
37955,Now you're just being hurtful.,jim
37956,"I'm sorry, it... why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat...",michael
37958,On her diet! He's a sports guy. He's scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.,michael
37959,Did Donna tell you that?,andy
37960,Real sports with Bryant Gumble.,michael
37961,So you're just making a giant assumption. You don't even know the guy.,andy
37962,You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.,michael
37963,"My name is Andy Bernard and I am a cuckold. For those of you unfamiliar with William Shakespeare, a cuckold is a man whose woman is cheating on him. I've lived the part. And let me tell you, I'd so much rather play the part on stage.",andy
37964,So... here's the thing about infidelity.,andy
37965,"Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.",michael
37966,How does that work?,andy
37967,Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.,michael
37968,"In any cheating movie, the person getting cheated on is the hero. You're Ali Larter, I'm Beyonce.",andy
37969,I am Beyonce always.,michael
37970,Not this time.,andy
37971,"Yes, I am.",michael
37972,"This guy's a high school baseball coach, right? Let's go check him out, see what a horrible person he is.",andy
37973,I would love that.,michael
37974,Yeah. Those teams have games and practices every day. Let's go check it out.,andy
37975,I have work to do.,michael
37976,"Oh, really? I thought you were the boss.",andy
37977,Let's go. [starts walking towards the elevator] I can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her.,michael
37978,[humming Call to Post] Bum bum BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM BUM bum bum,andy
37979,"All right, Andy, please.",michael
37980,Baseball!,andy
37981,"Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him.",michael
37982,Where?,andy
37983,Right there. The coach!,michael
37984,Stage right or stage left? I played batboy in damn yankees!,andy
37985,"Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base?",michael
37986,"[announcer's voice] And Now, coaching third base with two arms, two legs, and no heart. Capable of feeling pain.",andy
37987,"All right. Can you just-- can you just act normal for a second, please?",michael
37988,Whatever. I'm the one blending in.,andy
37990,Pam.,jim
37991,"Mm. Hey. Oh, hi, Gabe.",pam
37993,You were supposed to be the Lookout.,pam
37994,"Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag.",jim
37996,Sorry about that.,jim
37997,So embarrassing.,pam
37999,"Well, you were surprisingly restrained.",jim
38000,We will be well-rested tomorrow.,pam
38002,Excellent. Go for it.,jim
38004,"Right? So, uh, let's uh...",jim
38007,Same page. Just keep moving.,dwight
38009,Which we can't know.,dwight
38011,Unless we're unplugged.,dwight
38013,And wake up in the future.,dwight
38015,What?,dwight
38019,What?,dwight
38020,"I don't have $30,000 lying around. I have it buried very deeply, and I don't want to dig past a certain someone to get it.",dwight
38021,Chase Dixon is up. Could be a big play.,andy
38022,You have no idea what you're talking about.,michael
38023,I know it's like cricket.,andy
38024,"You don't. No, no.",michael
38025,"And it's--there's-- well, home plate is like a wicket.",andy
38026,"You don't know. You don't-- you don't know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn't even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it's like, 'Hey, Donna, why don't you wash the dishes?' 'High-five, Donna.' 'Hey, why don't you bring me my slippers?' 'Hi-five. I'm taking all the credit.'",michael
38027,Seems pretty well liked by the team.,andy
38028,"Okay, well, that's because he's paying their salary.",michael
38029,You do know that high school coaches don't pay their players.,andy
38030,"I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism.",michael
38031,"$30,000? There's gotta be another way.",dwight
38033,"Look, I will not pay.",dwight
38035,Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?',dwight
38037,Agreed. [shakes hands with Angela],dwight
38038,"Five times for $30,000? Not a bad stud fee. Better than most horses.",dwight
38039,But not in your bed. It's lumpy.,dwight
38041,Fine. Five times. [signs contract],dwight
38044,No.,dwight
38046,Do you understand how rare is that in nature?,dwight
38048,"Great game, coach.",andy
38049,"Shh! Okay, all right. Don't, don't.",michael
38050,You guys are awesome! Best game I've ever seen in my life.,andy
38052,Ha. The other guys can go die.,andy
38053,[whispers] Okay.,michael
38054,Baseball! Go talk to him.,andy
38055,No. God. You go talk to him.,michael
38057,Shane. Great game man!,andy
38059,"No. Uh, just big fans. Both of us.",andy
38061,Ha. No. No. But we're gay for baseball. [chuckles],andy
38063,"But I have a wife, actually, who I really love a lot.",andy
38065,Yeah. I am so into the institution of marriage.,andy
38067,"I mean, isn't marriage the best, you know? Two good people finding each other, getting all committed to each other. So you love baseball. What else do you love? Let's round you out as a person.",andy
38069,"I get it, man. I love it. That's what makes you a good coach. You know, but as a fan, it just helps me enjoy the game better if I know the coach loves his wife.",andy
38071,Of course.,andy
38073,"But real quick, I want you to meet my associate. Sheldon!",andy
38074,"No, no, no.",michael
38075,"Come on, get over here.",andy
38076,"I'm good. Oh, my God.",michael
38077,"Get- Get over here. Sheldon, say hi to the nice coach.",andy
38078,Sorry. I got some stomach cramps.,michael
38080,"Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart's still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, 'I'm sleeping with your wife.' And you know who does that? James freakin' Bond.",michael
38081,"Okay, orange slices. There ya go.",michael
38083,Don't thank me. Thank Dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!,michael
38085,You love it. There ya go.,michael
38086,"Now, were those for the team?",jim
38087,"Uh, no, they didn't say team. They just said coal Hawks.",michael
38088,Ah.,jim
38089,I don't think those were yours to take.,pam
38090,"Well, then it wouldn't be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane.",michael
38091,"I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior.",andy
38092,Did you talk to him?,pam
38093,I did.,michael
38094,You talked to the man whose wife you're having an affair with.,pam
38097,No. We just talked. He's very nice.,michael
38099,It did not.,michael
38101,Isn't it?,michael
38103,"I'm awful, aren't I?",michael
38105,I'm an awful guy! Ooh!,michael
38107,"I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I'm hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for.",michael
38116,"I don't care. I have an appetite for life! [eats cake] Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That's Lemon.",michael
38125,"You'll learn, baby. You'll learn.",michael
38126,"[pressing buttons to start microwave and moves towards his crotch] I am an honorable man, and I will honor the contract. But I don't have to give her the good stuff. Schrute sperm are strong, [banging on his crotch with drum sticks] but they're no match for a grown Schrute man. [drops yellow pages against his crotch] [screaming] [chuckling] Let's see what she gets. [bouncing crotch on bike and crashes into glass door] [thud] Aah!",dwight
38128,"Yeah, I noticed that.",michael
38130,Nope.,michael
38132,I have got big balls.,michael
38133,I don't think I'm gonna make it.,pam
38134,[yawning] What about an energy drink or something?,jim
38135,"[shakes head] It gets in the breast milk. If I drink it, Cece drinks it six hours later.",pam
38136,"Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it.",jim
38137,"Well, it does and it doesn't.",pam
38139,A place?,jim
38141,You sleep in the warehouse?,pam
38143,Okay.,jim
38145,Okay.,pam
38147,"Okay. [Phyllis avoids looking at Michael] Phyllis. Okay. Look at me. [continues to look away] Phyllis, look at-- [Phyllis turns to leave] okay, that's... [chases after her] All right, all right. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that's going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.",michael
38149,"Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we're into isn't very condo-appropriate.",michael
38151,"Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything.",michael
38152,Do you want someone to stop you? 'Cause no one's going to.,andy
38153,Nobody better try to stop me. Good. [leaves the office. door closes],michael
38154,I could have stopped him.,dwight
38155,Are you warmed up? [outside sliding door in warehouse],dwight
38157,"God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility? [zipper sound]",dwight
38159,Never mind. Just never mind.,dwight
38161,"Oh, it'll work. [Jim and Pam look shocked and disturbed] Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract.",dwight
38162,"[driving in car; returns to office; grabs ice cream out of freezer] How do I feel about breaking up with Donna? Good. Moral. I feel proud. [beeping; cut to Donna who is waiting in the parking lot of the motel] Like a grownup.[Donna receives text from phone] That was not easy because I really liked her a lot. And I'm a little bit emotional right now because I know that I absolutely made the right decision. [Donna has disappointed look; cut back to Michael in his office opening ice cream] At the end of the day, we have to do what's right. And it was either living with myself or... being happy. And I picked... the... former.",michael
38164,Yes?,michael
38166,"[sighs] Umm... I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to... the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.",michael
38168,Oh. Okay. I was talking about... what do-- what? What's going on?,michael
38169,"[on Youtube video] There is nothing wrong, nor will there ever be wrong with any Sabre printers. Case closed. [phone rings, Michael picks it up] Michael Scott, as seen on TV.",michael
38171,"OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl!",michael
38172,"Apparently, there are allegations that Sabre printers can cause a fire. So they asked me to give a statement to the press. I'm like, what? All right. So I do it. It's on TV last night. And it's in the paper today. And it's online. And then I call Froggy 98.7, the request line. I talk to the host about it on the air. It's like, come on, people, enough.",michael
38173,"Everybody, we are at DEFCON 5. I am officially the second-most watched clip of the day on the WBRE news site.",michael
38175,"Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times.",michael
38176,"So instead of working, you want...",jim
38177,Yes.,michael
38178,Okay.,jim
38179,Yes. Come on! Get it up! That's what... let's do it!,michael
38182,Please.,michael
38183,"Michael, you have to see, this is like, the cutest thing ever.",dwight
38184,"Really? A baby otter? Okay, um, count me in as who cares. It's not even that interesting a baby otter, it can't even stand up. [looks toward computer] It's trying to stand up... [choking up] there it goes.",michael
38186,Jo! We were not expecting you!,michael
38194,"Jo, Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office.",michael
38196,"Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand.",michael
38198,"If you say anything, so help me God, I'll break off the temples of your glasses and stick them in your eye sockets.",andy
38199,"So unfair. Even if I thought that our printers killed baby seals, I would not be a whistleblower. The Bernards, for generations, have silenced whistleblowers. It's how we made all our money. Woody Guthrie wrote a song about us. [sings] Old Mr. Bernard, old Mr. Bernard, who have you silenced today?",andy
38201,"There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like...",michael
38203,"Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.",michael
38205,Okay.,michael
38208,"We should give him a one-way ticket to Montego Bay, where they keep all the al-Qaeda.",michael
38210,"Yes. You put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can.",michael
38212,"I want these people to really pay, I want them to suffer. I'd prefer it if they died, 'cause it's not right.",michael
38214,Okay.,michael
38216,"Hey, IT guy.",dwight
38218,"Oh, sure thing, go ahead.",dwight
38220,"Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer?",dwight
38222,"You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.",dwight
38227,"Ridiculous, Angela. And like I'm going to believe one of his spermed lovers.",michael
38230,"Hold that thought. I don't want to waste your time, and I wouldn't dare waste mine. I didn't do it. Now, I don't know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here... [hands Jo a piece of paper] You should fire the following people.",dwight
38232,Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams?,dwight
38234,Are you referring to alchemy?,dwight
38236,I'm not dumb. I'm smart.,dwight
38238,Is there something that you would like to say to me?,michael
38239,Uh...,andy
38240,About talking to the press?,michael
38241,"I, I didn't know. I didn't do that!",andy
38242,Mmhmm.,michael
38243,"Okay? I, I... didn't do it.",andy
38244,I don't believe you.,michael
38245,I swear on the graves of my parents who aren't even dead yet.,andy
38246,"That's a little much. All right, all right, all right.",michael
38247,"I don't care, that's how much I swear!",andy
38248,"Okay, I believe you, I believe you.",michael
38249,I don't know who's giving Darryl any crap. He was more bothered about it than me.,andy
38250,Did you tell anyone outside of this office that the printers were catching on fire?,michael
38252,"Oh, no, no, no...",michael
38254,Oh my god. Was she cute?,michael
38256,"Oh, god, Darryl!",michael
38257,"I basically swore up and down that none of my employees did it, and then I find out that one of my best ones did. And now he's probably going to get fired for it. And if that is not poetic justice, I don't know what is.",michael
38269,It was me.,pam
38270,What was you? You were the leak?,jim
38271,Okay. I'm talking to this woman at daycare...,pam
38272,Uh-huh.,jim
38273,"She's telling me about all her amazing trip to Vietnam, I have nothing. I tell her our printers catch on fire, spontaneously!",pam
38274,Why'd you do that?,jim
38275,Her husband's a reporter.,pam
38276,Yeah.,jim
38277,"So now everyone hates Andy, and it's this whole mess, and I don't know what to do.",pam
38278,"Okay, just relax. Just need to relax.",jim
38279,I could tell Jo... or I could tell Michael.,pam
38280,This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.,jim
38281,You leaked it?,michael
38282,"I don't know what to do! Do I go tell Jo, or - I don't want everyone to keep blaming the wrong person!",pam
38283,"I don't know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god... my mind is going a mile an hour.",michael
38284,That fast?,pam
38285,Oh.,michael
38286,Two whistleblowers... two! I always thought Darryl and Pam might get me fired for something I said.,michael
38287,"[Michael knocks on Pam's desk] Yeah? [Michael points at Pam, himself, and Meredith, mimes drinking, driving, then points to his watch and holds up five fingers] I weirdly know exactly what you're saying to me.",pam
38288,So see you in Meredith's van in five minutes.,michael
38289,"Yeah, you didn't need to actually say it.",pam
38290,[in Meredith's van] I have never seen so many parking tickets.,pam
38292,"No, you know what's messed up? This situation all up in here is what's messed up! We need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this! Brain hurricane. Come on, think.",michael
38294,What do we got?,michael
38295,Um...,pam
38297,We're not going for yogurt.,pam
38298,"It's okay, she's cool, she also whistle-blew.",michael
38300,"Hey, hey, it's as interesting as a morgue.",michael
38305,"Okay, here's what we do. I say we just smash all the computers. We destroy the evidence. No evidence, no case.",michael
38306,Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers?,pam
38307,"No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers.",michael
38309,I don't think that's a good idea.,pam
38310,Just don't say no.,michael
38313,"That's just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let's just...",michael
38314,"Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.",pam
38315,Okay. You can count on me.,michael

38320,Basement office? You mean like a lair?,dwight
38321,Hey Jo.,michael
38323,"I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make 'em come to work, and we work 'em, and we make 'em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay 'em but we make 'em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, it's Christmas, but right after they're back in the thick of it.",michael
38325,What?,michael
38326,It doesn't matter what I know.,michael
38328,Why?,michael
38330,"Well, deal with this. [crosses arms]",michael
38332,What?,michael
38334,Are you going to kill me?,michael
38337,Okay.,dwight

38346,What? Based on what?,andy
38348,All right. Sounds good.,dwight
38349,"Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy.",jim
38350,"Yeah. You know, I mean, for all we know it could have been... Jim.",andy
38351,Really?,jim
38353,I have rights.,michael
38355,I am not going to tell you anything.,michael
38357,"Well, I'm going through a little bit of a rough patch.",michael
38359,"Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down.",michael
38361,"And my new favorite restaurant sucks... I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? ... I miss Holly.",michael
38363,Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.,michael

We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and porn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch.",dwight

38404,"Uh, thanks. Yeah, you know, just seemed like the right thing to do.",andy
38406,"[to press] We at Sabre have betrayed the trust that we have built with our customers. We regret our slow response and our lapse in candor and judgment. At this time, we are issuing a full recall of all Sabre GH400 printers. We will not rest until this problem is solved. There will be no questions. Are there any questions?",michael
38408,That was fun.,michael
38410,Thanks. Today helped.,michael
38412,"Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua.",michael
38423,"Go, go, go, go!",andy
38424,[performs magic-tricks while lip-syncing],michael
38426,"Hiya! Ha! [climbs on Phyllis' desk and starts kicking things off, bites off the head of a stuffed animal]",dwight
38429,"[song ends] Toby, how did we do?",andy
38431,Whoo! We did it! [everyone starts cheering],andy
38432,"I suppose summer had to end sometime. It's sad, though, because I had a great summer. I got West Nile virus, lost a ton of weight. Then I went back to the lake. I stepped on a piece of glass in the parking lot, which hurt. That got infected even though I peed on it. Saw 'Inception.' Or at least I dreamt I did.",michael
38433,"Brocolli Rob, obviously, will be there.",andy
38435,"And JC. We call him Blorville, because he looks like a black Orville Redenbacher.",andy
38438,Hey!,andy
38440,Not at all.,andy
38444,"Am I angry that Gabe stole my girlfriend over the summer? No. I've been through anger-management, OK? So right now, I am sitting on a nice beach at Cape Cod, gazing out across the whitecaps. Oh, look, it's a humpback whale. How pretty. He's eating Gabe.",andy
38445,[goes to change thermostat as Dwight puts a locked cover over it] Hey. What are you doing?,pam
38446,"From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack.",dwight
38448,"Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy.",dwight
38449,"Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people.  Oh, you did hear.",jim
38450,"[drinking from Camelback] Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably.  Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration.",dwight
38451,"Dwight Schrute, star salesman, beet farmer, bed-and-breakfast proprietor, aspiring freelance bodyguard. Add to that list owner of this building. Then burn the list.",dwight
38459,"New guy sucks. Calls me the Nard-Man. I'm the Nard-Dog, okay? Nard-man is my father.",andy
38461,"That kid is the worst. Needs to be fired, Michael.",andy
38462,"He's not the worst, okay? He's not the worst. You know who's the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though. [starts drinking coffee] Ah! It's not cappuccino.",michael
38465,"It's just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I'll look into it, okay?",michael
38466,"Wow, that's a lot of keys.",jim
38467,"The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.",dwight
38468,"That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back.",jim
38469,Where?,dwight
38470,I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these. [pulls out stethoscope],jim
38471,Give me that.,dwight
38472,"Yep. Wait, and this. [hands Dwight a hammer]",jim
38473,Yes.,dwight
38474,Go get 'em.,jim
38475,"What happened to me this summer? Dwight bought the building, so actually, this has been the busiest summer of my life.",jim
38476,"[Jim quietly takes Dwight's keychain and starts adding keys to it, Pam giggles] Hey, what's so funny over here? Ha. Very nice. Give me my keys. [removes keys and throws them at Jim] Ha. Ha. Not. Funny. Jim.",dwight
38477,Sorry.,pam
38478,"Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but...",jim
38479,It was really funny.,pam
38480,"Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.",jim
38481,I love you.,pam
38488,"Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me.",michael
38490,To get some ice cream for everybody. It's national ice cream afternoon. Great.,michael
38491,"And another thing I did this summer, I hired my nephew.",michael
38492,"Having Luke here is a pretty big deal for me, because his mother, who also happens to be my half-sister, kind of cut me off from that side of the family 15 years  a-  14. The last time I saw Luke was the opening day of 'Ace Ventura II' and that was '95, so yes, 15 years on the dot. Anyway, I lost him in a forest.",michael
38493,Don't bother Luke.,michael
38494,Why is there a circle with a line through it?,pam
38495,"That means don't. Haven't you seen Ghostbusters, Pam?",michael
38497,"No, it... Yes, okay, right. [erases don't] All right, yep. My bad. I got it. Here we go. [writes 'Don't'  in front of symbol]",michael
38499,"Come on. Okay, um... [draws a circle around 'Don't' with a line through it] That's as clear as I can make it.",michael
38501,Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us.,michael
38502,Who's gonna tell on us? Gabe?,dwight
38504,"Nope, it won't be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke.",michael
38505,How close?,dwight
38506,"Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?",michael
38507,Yes. Of course.,dwight
38509,"No. No, Toby. He's not. Yes he is. He's my nephew.",michael
38511,Luke is my nephew.,michael
38513,"Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.",michael
38515,Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.,michael
38516,"Oh, man, so many points being made.",jim
38518,"God, when he needed help on Earth, who did he hire? Jesus Christ, his son.",michael
38520,Thank you.,michael
38521,But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus.,jim
38522,"No! No. I'm just saying, why does God get to do something that I don't?",michael
38524,"Well, then, why aren't you bugging me to fire everybody who's bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That's reverse nepotism.  He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!",michael
38527,"Because I wanted you to come to me and say, 'Wow, he is so great.' And I was gonna say, 'Well, it's in the genes.' And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is.",michael
38529,Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!,michael
38531,Or enough for everyone?,pam
38534,"Clutch cream run, bro.",andy
38535,"Get whatever you want, on me.",pam
38536,You really think you can make it up to me with food?,jim
38537,I don't know. That usually works.,pam
38538,"I feel horrible for blowing Jim's prank. I don't know if you can tell, but he's mildly upset. And Dwight hasn't been messed with in a while, so he's become a monster. I need to make this right.",pam
38540,"Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off!",michael
38542,"All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store.",michael
38543,"Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, 'I don't own an Ebay store,' so...",jim
38544,"Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project.",michael
38548,I'm reconsidering sending them back anyway.,michael
38549,"You get that kid to open this car, or I'm gonna do it myself... by calling Tripple A.",andy
38550,Wait a minute.,michael
38552,"Don't-all right. Well, ok, you've just committed a felony.",michael
38555,"This kid's costing us sales, Michael.",andy
38557,"No, I know they fit. It's not about the fit.",michael
38559,Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.,michael
38562,You don't have all the facts.,michael
38564,I love him.,michael
38566,No. No. He's my nephew.,michael
38568,"Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool.",michael
38570,I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump.,michael
38572,"Luke and I have been working side-by-side as master and commander. Me as master, he as commander. Occasionally he will need a little push, and I will do that, and he'll slow down, and I'll push him again. That's the thing with kids, you have to keep pushing. You have to push them until they push you back. And then you push some more. It's all about give and take, but mostly it's about pushing each other.",michael
38574,"Yeah, yeah. Like when he presses 'Doors closed' the doors open. Or he presses 'lobby' it goes to third floor, stuff like that. Can you do that?",pam
38576,Dwight is about to get so Pammed.,pam
38577,"Hey, did you SMS text message me?",dwight
38578,"Yeah, I wanted to show you something in the lobby. Come on.",pam
38579,"[as elevator doors won't shut] Okay, that's weird. Just hitting 'door closed.' What?",dwight
38580,There we go.,pam
38581,"Is this elevator going up? Hey, the elevator is disobeying us! [elevator stops between floors]  Okay, okay. We are stuck. We are stuck. Hank, Hank! Can you hear us? Oh, my God. Okay. Emergency protocol.",dwight
38582,Let's just calm down.,pam
38583,"Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately.",dwight
38584,I don't-,pam
38585,Use your talons! Pry 'em open! [starts to urinate in elevator corner],dwight
38586,"Ok, Dwi-Oh, my God!",pam
38587,"Well, don't look, freak!",dwight
38588,"Dwight, what are you doing!? We've only been in here for, like, two seconds!",pam
38589,I've got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner!,dwight
38590,You've gotta be kidding me.,pam
38591,"Luke is going to use his laser pointer to point to account setup. You click on that first, then a whole new-Not, no, no, no! [Luke points laser at Oscar's forehead] Luke, come on. Come on. Not on Oscar's head. Alright. Luke, come on. Stop it!",michael
38593,Give me the pointer.,michael
38595,"No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela's boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously.",michael
38597,Okay.,michael
38599,"All right. Okay. Good job. Okay, email accounts. So we're starting with account setup-",michael
38600,"Oh, my God, is it in my eyeball? I think he's burning my eye.",andy
38603,"Okay, can I have that?",michael
38605,"Ok, I am going to count down from five.",michael
38607,I'm not kidding.,michael
38609,"Give-okay. Alright, give it up.",michael
38611,"[bending Luke over desk, spanking him repeatedly] You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke!",michael
38613,"That's what you're going to do, Luke!",michael
38615,I had to do that.,michael
38617,All right. Are we good? [Luke runs out crying] You're okay. He's okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.,michael
38622,You follow him on Twitter?,jim
38625,"Yes, of course. What is this in reference to?",michael
38626,Pam?,jim
38627,"Oh, hey Jim. Some prankster switched the elevator buttons on Dwight.",pam
38628,I did not do this.,jim
38629,"I know. Yeah, and it was going really great at first. I got video.",pam
38630,This is impressive.,jim
38631,"Well, you know... they don't call me the Bart Simpson of Scranton for nothing.",pam
38632,Do they call you that?,jim
38633,They do call me that.,pam
38634,"Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down.",jim
38635,"Nope. Scared of getting cut in half. Also, there's pee on the floor.",pam
38636,"Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?",jim
38637,Yeah.,pam
38638,Great.,jim
38639,How ya doin'?,dwight
38640,Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.,jim
38641,Stop drinking the water! Stop!,pam
38642,"[Phyllis and Andy act out Luke getting spanked] No, no, no, no. It's the other hand. Right hand. Yeah.",andy
38643,"Would have been nice to work with my family. It would have been nice if Luke had been able to stay here. But he couldn't. These things seldom work out. I don't know how Ringling Brothers do it. Night after night, town after town, all across America. You would think they'd be sick of each other by now. But, clearly, they make it work. And my hat's off to them.",michael
38644,[Dwight starts aggressively spanking Andy] Whoa! Whoa! Hey. Whoa. Dwight! Stop!,andy
38646,That's it? Really? That's nothing. All right. That's highway robbery.,michael
38648,I can do that.,michael
38650,"Okay. Wait, what?",michael
38652,Is there another option?,michael
38654,Wow. Late every day this week.,dwight
38655,We signed Cici up for this daycare. It's on the other side of town. The traffic...,pam
38656,Why didn't I think of this before? Did you know that there is a daycare center opening right here in this building?,dwight
38657,Is there really?,jim
38658,"Now that I own the building, I'm looking for new sources of revenue. And a daycare center... Ha ha ha [laughing maniacally] Well I guess it's not an evil idea. It's just a regular idea. But there is no good laugh for a regular idea.",dwight
38659,Welcome to the Sesame Avenue Daycare Center for infants and toddlers.,dwight
38660,Aaah!,jim
38662,You remember my cousin Mose.,dwight
38664,Were you painting in the dark?,pam
38665,Wait. Is this your place Dwight?,jim
38666,Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?,dwight
38667,I don't really think we need...,pam
38668,Oh... lets take the tour Pam.,jim
38669,Yeah.,pam
38670,Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters. [pause] I see you found out magical toy box Jim.,dwight
38671,These are actually forks and knives from the break room.,jim
38672,"Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child's imagination that's Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and... Ms. Fork.",dwight
38673,And a soy sauce packet.,pam
38674,Oh! That shouldn't have been in there. I'm embarrassed.,dwight
38675,Don't beat yourself up.,jim
38676,"We come fully equipped with a restroom. Feeding trough, play bucket, and room for a plant, in success.",dwight
38677,Who will be watching the children?,jim
38678,No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible.,dwight
38679,Prove it.,jim
38680,What?,dwight
38681,"Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works.",jim
38682,"Oh no, no, no.",dwight
38683,"But I'll tell you this, if this works out, I think we're looking real good.",jim
38684,"I promise you, that door locks! [Jim closes the door]",dwight
38686,This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it!,michael
38687,"Ok, you know what? I made a mistake. I committed corporate punishment. My bad. It's over. It's done. But my punishment is ... um ... worse than hell.",michael
38689,I know what you want to ask me. 'Did your mom ever see you naked?',michael
38691,"So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don't think so. We're going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That's the key.",michael
38692,"Boycott the Steamtown Mall! Everyone, you heard me! Cancel all of your business with the Steamtown Mall!",dwight
38694,"All of it! The mall, the stores, the kiosks!",dwight
38696,Did something happen Dwight?,jim
38697,"Yeah, something happened. Oh yeah, something happened, Jim.",dwight
38698,"Well, tell us what it is. I mean, it would help us to get some context so we can get on board.",andy
38699,You don't want to know.,dwight
38702,"[on phone] Look, I'm not going to tell you that we have lower prices. Is price something that is important to you? Ok, well let me know if anything changes.",pam
38703,Pam?,jim
38704,"I can't do this. I don't have this sales gene, or whatever it is. Tell me everything is going to be ok.",pam
38705,Everything is going to be ok.,jim
38706,Tell me I'm good at sales.,pam
38707,You're good... you're good at sales.,jim
38708,"The unfair thing about working in sales is that your salary is almost all commission. So, you suck at sales, you make almost no money. I guess that's fair.",pam
38709,Dwight?,andy
38710,What?,dwight
38711,Did you call all of my clients at the mall and cancel all my business while using the 'F' word?,andy
38712,Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients.,dwight
38714,"Oh yes I will! That mall is corrupt, ok! They're 'appearance'ists!",dwight
38715,"Ok, Dwight. We can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened?",jim
38716,"Yeah, what happened Dwight?",pam
38717,Ok.,jim
38718,"You guys know me. You know that I'm not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall...",dwight
38719,So what happened?,pam
38720,"I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough for precious heirlooms.",dwight
38724,"Wait, wait, wait. That's actually a really good idea Kelly.",jim
38727,"Dwight, how about this? Instead of boycotting, you and I, together, go down to that store and we teach those snobs a lesson.",jim
38728,"No, you and I... and I. I'm going to come with you.",andy
38729,Ok,dwight
38730,Alright.,jim
38731,Did you assume that I would automatically side with the rich snobby shop owner? [removes cuff link] How about now? [removes other cuff link] How about now? [removes tie clip] How about now?,andy
38733,One hour.,michael
38735,"One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today.",michael
38737,"No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time.",michael

38746,"No, no. I want to hear you tell it.",jim

38755,[hesitates] I am. I am the office administrator!,pam
38757,"Oh, we're not interested. We're not interested at all.",pam
38758,There are a few ways to get promoted. One is to wait for an opening and apply for it. That's the main way. But this could work.,pam
38759,"Toby, can I really tell you anything?",michael
38761,"Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my penis... I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah... weird. I think that was ... I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F.

38763,"A few months ago. I was talking to someone at corporate, who isn't there anymore, and I think the paperwork just got lost in the shuffle. Can you believe that?",pam

38826,"Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn't able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out.

39420,"I don't know, I mean people were being really mean to Meredith.",andy
39422,How is that relevant to anything?,andy

Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You're wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don't feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn't joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I don't know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok.  Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye.",michael

39864,"Stanley just drank OJ out of my mug, and didn't seem to realize that it wasn't his hot coffee. So the question has to be asked, is there no limit to what he won't notice?",jim
39868,"[shirtless, wearing only a tie] Handbag.",andy
39870,Shh! Shhh! [watches Jim put a cardboard box over Stanley's monitor],andy
39871,"[standing outside the conference room, wearing fake teeth, watching Stanley walk in] All right, everybody, take a seat. As you may have heard, our branch on the planet Jupiter is up eight thousand percent in sales!",michael
39874,"[turns around, is wearing a mustache] Bye, Stanley! Love you! [waves, Stanley leaves]",pam
39875,"[standing next to a pony] So long, Stanley!",dwight
39880,"A lot of people are really getting into Halloween this year! [puts head down over fake bomb made from cardboard, high pitched voice] Six seconds, MacGruber! [lifts head] Pam's got a lot of fun stuff planned! [puts head down, high pitched voice] Uh, two seconds MacGruber! [lifts head] Including a... costume contest, and bobbing for apples, and a Ouija board... OHHH! BOOM! OHH EXPLOSION! [throws fake bomb, takes off sunglasses, points to camera] MACGRUBERRRR!",michael
39881,"People are really into the costume contest this year. Might have something to do with the prize, maybe you've heard of it. The 2011 Scranton Wilkes-Barre coupon book worth over fifteen thousand dollars in savings!",pam
39882,Stop.,jim
39883,"[has his hands around Jim's neck] Too late! If I was the real Scranton Strangler, you'd be so strangled right now. If you're out there, strangler, you will get caught! By me.",dwight
39884,Sounds like someone's really trying to convince us that he's not the Scranton Strangler.,jim
39885,To my chickens I'm the Scranton Strangler.  [looks at Pam] Oh-ho! That's very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute's mom.,dwight
39886,What?,pam
39887,You're only one third as beautiful and only half her height.,dwight
39888,"I'm supposed to be Olive Oyl. And it makes more sense when I'm standing next to Popeye, but... Jim doesn't want to put his costume on.",pam
39889,[places pipe in mouth] I am Popeye!,jim
39890,"I've never really been a costume guy. Even when I was a kid, it just felt like something I was too old for. And then this morning, when Pam hands me this little number [holds up Popeye costume, shakes head] ...no.",jim
39892,MACGRUBER!,michael
39894,"Oh, here we go!",michael
39896,[laughs] OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?,michael
39897,Lake Erie.,dwight
39899,"So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?",michael
39905,Blackula!,michael
39907,"Oh, so... I almost forgot. You'll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. That's like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.",michael
39909,"Yeah. I'm sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man.",michael
39911,Really? We're good?,michael
39913,Okay. [reaches out and shakes Darryl's hand] Okay.,michael
39915,Oh. It's a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.,michael
39916,Darryl Philbin is the greatest guy in the world. And you know what I'd like? I would like to have all the racists brought together and take Darryl Philbin out to lunch. Just to see what they're missing.,michael
39934,Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?,dwight
39937,"So four years ago, when I was in Stamford, Connecticut, and dating someone else, Pam went on two dates with Danny. Which was obviously the greatest love story ever told, given how much people are walking on eggshells around us.",jim
39938,We were basically Romeo and Juliet.,pam
39939,That's right.,jim
39940,Except where Juliet doesn't have that great a time and Romeo doesn't call back after two dates.,pam
39941,Yikes.,jim
39942,But I've learned to love again. [puts her arm on Jim's shoulder] He's a cartoon sailor.,pam
39943,"Oh, no.",jim
39944,And looks so handsome in his UNIFORM! Please?,pam
39945,"No. No, I'm not gonna-no.",jim
39946,Tuna! Tuna! Do you want us to skip this party?,andy
39947,I don't care.,jim
39949,You know what else? [pulling fake teeth out of his mouth] The-this... this sucks for Jim. Right? But it also sucks for us. Because we don't get invited to a ton of Halloween parties. [puts teeth back in],andy
39951,[removes teeth] Creed's going?!,andy
39952,Madge from the warehouse just made her first sale. Madge. We should have been doing this a long time ago.,jim
39953,Erin! Would you please do me a solid and get Darryl Philbin on the speakerphone?,michael
39955,"Hi, Darryl, come out here, please.",michael
39957,"You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!",michael
39959,"Yeah, I bet it is! If you're gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed.",michael
39961,"[leans over toward Erin] Um, hit the speakerphone button. The speakerphone button? The same button as you hit before... or sit on it.",pam
39962,This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.,michael
39964,"I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don't care if I take a bullet. We're gonna call them, we're gonna put them on speakerphone right now...",michael
39966,And we are going to straighten this out.,michael
39967,Screw corporate! They probably stole the idea anyway.,andy
39968,Mmhm!,michael
39970,I'm a little peeved at Darryl right now.,michael
39971,He went to Gabe behind your back.,dwight
39972,"No, he didn't go behind my back. He went over my head.",michael
39973,He went over your head to go behind your back.,dwight
39974,What is taking someone from behind?,michael
39975,"No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous.",dwight
39976,"It was a good idea, though.",michael
39977,Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea.,dwight
39978,"Hey, Danny.",andy
39980,"I'm really sorry, but we can't come to your party tonight.",andy
39982,You were?,andy
39985,"We're just like, totally caught in the middle here.",andy
39987,Well Jim and Pam basically begged us not to go...,andy
40004,"Garbage magnet. [throws magnet] Garbage magnet, God! Magnets are interesting enough, you don't need to tart them up with some design. [to Michael] I can't believe this doesn't make you mad!",dwight
40005,[staring at Gabe and Kevin] What the hell are they talking about?,michael
40006,"Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.",dwight
40007,"Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don't-[sees Kevin and Gabe fist-bump] Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?",michael
40009,"Oh, you're sorry?",michael
40011,What did you just thought?,michael
40013,All right.,michael
40015,Okay.,michael
40017,"Well, don't let it happen again.",michael
40019,I-,michael
40023,That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.,jim
40025,"Oh, my gosh! People keep blowing it out of proportion! It's not even a history.",pam
40027,It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about?,jim
40029,It was two.,pam
40031,"No, we um, we had plans for a third, but then I don't know, you never called me back, so...",pam
40032,Oooh! You can't handle the truth! [laughs],jim
40034,"Yeah? [stops laughing] It was though, that's what happened.",pam
40036,Hmm-mm.,pam
40037,"Okay, this whole going over my head-gate? Is making people act weird. The chain of command is crumbling. Do you know what just happened? I just made Kevin cry. And Gabe looks like Lady Gaga. That's not Halloween. Halloween should be a day in which we honor monsters and not be mad at each other.",michael
40039,You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.,michael
40041,"Okay, that might help. If you said 'I'm sorry' in front of everybody.",michael
40043,In front of me.,michael
40045,So that's it.,michael
40047,Is it?,michael
40049,"Sookehhh. [removes teeth] Bill Compton, from True Blood.",andy
40055,"Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself.",pam
40057,"Yeah, I gotta get in on this. [mocking Darryl] Hey, it's cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive! And I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!",michael
40058,Still don't know who I am? I'll give you a hint. I go over other people's heads.,michael
40059,"Michael, this is a bad idea.",pam
40060,What's a bad idea?,michael
40061,"Dressing up as somebody-I mean, when has that ever worked for you?",pam
40062,"NEVER! [tosses wig] Okay, you know what? Fine.  I'm not Darryl. And thank God I'm not Darryl.",michael
40066,Angela as the nurse!,pam
40069,"Hey, can I play? Why don't you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?",michael
40070,We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?,jim
40072,Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it.,michael
40074,"Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?",michael
40075,Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.,dwight
40076,"I know how to sit on a fence. Hell, I can even sleep on a fence. The trick is to do it face down with the post in your mouth.",dwight
40077,If you had one word you would use to describe Darryl what would that word be?,michael
40084,Hey.,jim
40086,"When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back?",jim
40088,"Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is...",jim
40090,Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.,jim
40092,Nope.,jim
40098,I'd remember talking about Jim. That wasn't it.,pam
40099,Just tell her the real reason.,jim
40101,Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.,jim
40102,"I did. And it's just one of those things that's going to keep gnawing at me, like 'gnaw, gnaw, why? Why didn't he? I have no idea why.'",pam
40104,"Hey, man.",jim
40105,"Thank you! Thank you. I got it. Now I know. You thought I was a little dorky. You know? [gibberish sounds] Okay. Well, excuuuuse me.",pam
40107,Thank you.,michael
40110,"If they're good ideas, I'm not gonna say no!",michael
40112,"That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?",michael
40114,Oh...,michael
40116,Well...,michael
40119,"Stop it! Stop, stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it.",michael
40121,"You don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.",michael
40124,I am not budging on the hat issue.,michael
40126,Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.,michael
40128,"Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call.",michael
40130,Sorry I was a jerk.,michael
40131,Friends fight. Friends fight.,michael
40132,"What's up, man?",andy
40134,"When I was a freshman in college, I worked at the student newspaper, the Cornell Daily Sun? This was at Cornell. I had to write an op-ed column every day.  Bernard's Regards.",andy
40136,"I started to ask myself, 'Do I have big plans here?' I didn't want to become editor of that paper, so I got up and walked right out of Walter Bernard hall, and that's actually when I heard eight male voices, singing, unencumbered by instruments. I was hooked. So is becoming CEO of this company your a capella group?  Come on, we're going to Danny's bar. Public School.",andy
40138,"To be honest, I still can't believe he didn't call her back. Who doesn't call a dork like that back?",jim
40139,"Oh, wow!",pam

40141,"Aww, my hero!",pam

40149,Stop.,jim
40150,"[under his breath] Um... kay. Uh, alright.",michael
40151,One of the simplest ways to cut down on the spread of germs is to use something called the vampire cough.,pam
40153,"Oh, no, it's just that if a vampire had to cough, he would do it like this. [coughs into elbow]",pam
40154,Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania? [looks at camera] 'Cause of the euro.,dwight
40155,"Well, other things you can do to help cut down on the spread of disease are to wash your hands regularly. Don't come in if you're sick.",pam
40156,[rolls his eyes and shakes his head] Uh...,dwight
40157,"And get your flu shot. Also, I'm going to set up hand sanitizing stations around the office.",pam
40158,"NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.",dwight
40159,Elaborate.,jim
40160,"The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter...",dwight
40161,I'm not - I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do that.,pam
40162,Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.,dwight
40163,"So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.",jim
40164,Yes. I would welcome it.,dwight
40165,"[sneezes on Dwight, looks at camera] You're welcome.",jim
40166,"The principle is sound. To avoid illness, expose yourself to germs, enabling your immune system to develop antibodies. I don't know why everyone doesn't do this. Maybe they have something against living forever.",dwight
40168,Cece's getting christened today.,pam
40169,Big day.,jim
40170,Everyone from work is here. We weren't planning on that.,pam

40175,"Oh, yes. [mimicking smoking] Doobie-doobie doo.",michael
40176,"I invited everyone in the office because it's not a day for just Jim or Pam or the baby or me. It is about us all. And I thought we should all celebrate... my joy. And our, all of ours joys.",michael
40177,"[looking at Cece, under his breath] Ah, man. [looks at Erin talking to Gabe]",andy
40178,"Does the Nard-dog want Nard-pups? Yeah. I want a big ol' litter of Nard-pups. All jumping around, sucking on the teet. Put 'em in a box, give 'em to my neighbors. Yeah, I want kids.",andy

40182,"Oh, Michael, this is just for family.",pam
40183,But I'm the Godfather.,michael
40184,"It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.",jim
40185,Are you talking to me?,michael
40186,"[whispers to Pam] Ok, your turn.",jim
40187,Scooch. Before I shoot you in the head.,michael
40188,"Okay, Michael. Um, you know I love when you do that voice, but today, I'm so sorry. I need you to tell me that you know you're not Cece's godfather.",pam
40189,Yeah.,michael

40191,[normal voice] I'm not the godfather.,michael

40193,[clears his throat] So who is the godfather?,michael
40194,"Our friend, Seth, and his wife there.",pam
40195,"Okay. Old friend, like, you've known him since kindergarten?",michael
40196,"No, I met his wife in Mommy and Me. They're a great couple. You should meet them later.",pam

40198,"Okay. Thank you for coming, Michael.",pam
40199,"I don't even know how to say this, but Cece is turning out to be a little b-i-t-c-h. And that's not true, but her parents are kind of boxing me out.",michael
40203,Good morning.,michael
40210,"Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year.

40216,"[whispering, going into the bathroom with Cece] Okay. Okay. There's my girl. All right. Hold on one second. There we go. What's that face for? Oh, my-oh, my God. Cece, no. No, no, no, not on the dress! Cece, stop!",jim
40217,[seeing Jim come in with Cece wearing an old t-shirt] What?,pam

40225,You said you checked it.,pam
40226,I did... say that.,jim
40228,"Jim and Pam and Cece really seem to be clicking. They are totally gelling. It's as if they leave my office and they go to another office that sells happiness. And good for them. That's great, because, you know, the paper industry's not gonna last forever.",michael
40230,Mm. No. Wrong on both counts.,jim

40295,All right. And cider.,jim
40296,[pointing to group of young adults laughing] Look at that. Look at that. That's fun. We need to do stuff together outside of work. Let's go help Africa. Let's go build an airport. We'll start small. We'll have a car wash. We'll send some cheerleaders to regionals.,michael
40299,"Yeah, well, that's just a pick-up scene. Okay, we don't have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together.",michael

40303,"Well, it's, it's-",michael
40305,"No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What's so great about your lives that you think you're better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You're mean. You're mean girls.

40938,"Michael, I think that feeling only goes one way. And I think that Ryan knows that, and he's taking advantage of you.",pam
40939,I think you are wrong.,michael

Oscar is my queen. That's easy. Gimme a hard one. That's what Oscar said. Toby is the instruction card you throw away. Pam's a solid seven. And yeah, you know what? Ryan is probably, like, a two.

41268,"Umm, let me see.",pam
41269,How many offices are there? Oh I'll just look at the one sheet myself.,dwight

41271,"[chuckles] You're a funny guy Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm going to walk down the hall and say 'Wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is.' I can't wait.",dwight
41272,Mmhmm.,pam
41273,I lied about some aspects of the building.,pam

41292,Well thanks.,pam
41294,China has been loaning us billions upon billions of dollars. We are going to be owing them for the rest of our lives. And they will control us.,michael

41388,Oh come on.,dwight
41396,"Hey, it's snowing.",jim
41397,"[mocking] Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful.",dwight
41398,"[Jim goes outside, makes a snowball, and brings it back inside] Hey, Dwight. [Jim throws the snowball at Dwight and everyone laughs]",jim
41399,"Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!",dwight
41400,"Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right?",jim
41401,Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.,dwight
41404,You apologize to me right now.,dwight
41405,You've got something on your nose.,jim
41406,You apologize right now.,dwight
41407,No.,jim
41408,"Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.",dwight
41409,You got it.,jim
41410,That sounds awesome. Can we all do it?,andy
41411,"No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it. [Jim continues to shake Dwight's hand] Jim, let go. Let go.",dwight
41423,"Before we kick off the party, I just want to remind everyone that an office party is just that...",pam
41424,Yeah!,michael
41425,A party. It's not an excuse to get really drunk or confront someone or have a cathartic experience of any kind.,pam
41426,Pam? Pam?,michael
41427,Pam?,dwight
41428,"Wow, there are, there are questions to that. Okay. Um, you know what, no questions. Last item on the agenda, Toby would like to make an announcement.",pam
41430,Hi.,michael
41432,"Uh, because you've been on the Lam? Because the 'boring police' have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?",michael
41434,"Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!",michael
41435,Death to Toby!,dwight
41437,"You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?",michael
41440,Is it criminal?,andy
41442,Have we heard of it?,andy
41444,Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave?,dwight
41451,"Oh, Scranton Strangler! [all react]",andy
41453,That was the worst joke ever.,michael
41455,"Okay. Okay goodbye, goodbye.",michael
41457,What? What?,michael
41459,"Hold on, Holly's coming back here?",michael
41462,"That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?",michael
41465,"Holly's coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party.",michael
41467,"You know what, we'll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree.",michael
41468,Okay.,dwight
41469,Cancel. We're canceling it. [Michael starts to throw away all of the food],michael
41471,"No, we have to cancel the party.",michael
41473,"No, no, no, we're gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new.",michael
41474,I bought these.,andy
41475,I know.,michael
41476,These cookies are fine.,andy
41477,It's not. They're not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.,michael
41478,"Michael, Michael, wait we don't have, we don't have the budget for another party.",pam
41479,"Well then everybody'll chip in, it'll be fine.",michael
41480,"I honestly think you're idealizing people here again, Michael. I don't think that's gonna happen.",pam
41481,"You know what, I'll pay for it. I'll pay for the party. It doesn't matter. This is way too important. People, Holly's coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work.",michael
41482,"Man, I worked hard. I worked so hard for this! I was after corporate constantly. I emailed Joe. I wrote letters. And, know who I end up owing this to is the Scranton strangler. Thank you. Thank you, Scranton strangler. I love you! You just took one more person's breath away.",michael
41483,"We have always had good Christmas parties here, as you know, but they've never been cool. [imitating Sean Connery] The name is Bond... Santa Bond. I'll have an eggnog, shaken, not stirred. Classic Brosnan. Santa... wonderful tradition. Everybody loves Santa. Everybody can't get enough of the jolly old man. But that is a myth, because you know what, he is not necessarily a big fat guy with a beard. He's not necessarily an old guy. No one knows what the real Santa Claus... God! Ow! [camera pans down to Angela pinning Michael's pants]",michael
41485,"Well, this year's gonna be different. We're gonna have fun. It's not gonna be tacky. It's going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It's not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It's gonna be cool, sleek Santa.",michael
41487,Okay. Sure.,michael
41489,You never know about the press.,michael
41491,Could he help us with some parking tickets?,michael
41493,"Well, then he's not a senator.",michael
41495,Okay.,michael
41496,Hey.,jim
41497,Hey.,pam
41498,"We still doing the gifts today? [Pam nods] I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.",jim
41499,"Yes. But don't get too excited, 'cause I didn't have a lot of time this year.",pam
41500,Me neither. Whew.,jim
41501,Okay.,pam
41502,"I've been working forever on Jim's present. He always gives me the best Christmas gifts. He'll take a memory or a private joke, and he'll create something totally unique. I love them. So this year I made him something. A comic book. It stars Jimmy Halpert, a mild-mannered paper Salesman who, while riding his bike through the forest, is bitten by a radioactive bear, becomes 'bear man'. Wreaks havoc on the office. It's really good.",pam
41503,"[A note is on Jim's computer that says, 'It is time. Parking lot at noon.' Jim nods and hands it to Dwight who burns it.]",jim
41504,"Okay... [sighs] Oh, no, no, no, no! Fake tree. No, no!",michael
41505,"No, it has the little...",pam
41506,"Pam, no, no. Holly's coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks it's a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you.",michael
41508,"Yes, that's me. Come on it.",michael
41509,"[scats awkwardly] There's nothing classier than boring Jazz music. I am here to tell ya. And I made a bit of a judgment call. I hired one musician, because I thought, what's better, to hire an entire quartet for half an hour, or one bassist for the entire day?",michael
41510,"Hey, uh, any volunteers to come with me to go buy a Christmas tree?",pam
41512,Why do you always think that girls are gonna be at the party? No one invited girls. It's just us.,pam
41513,"I will help. Although my 'brid', my hybrid, my Prius hybrid, won't fit a tree. Which is ironic, considering how many trees it saves on a daily basis.",andy
41515,"I do, however, have a hookup with a dude who has a pickup.",andy
41516,"Oh, do you mean Darryl? That's a great idea. I'll ask him.",pam
41517,You know Darryl?,andy
41518,Yeah. He works here. We all know him.,pam
41519,"I should come along, just 'cause he's my, you know, he's my hookup.",andy
41520,Cool.,pam
41527,"It's cool, Darryl, I'm here too.",andy
41528,"Hey, sorry, I really didn't want to come in. It's just that we have to go buy a new Christmas tree, and we're hoping we could borrow your truck.",pam
41530,"Come on, it'll be fun. We could do doughnuts in the snow on the way back.",andy
41532,"Okay. Sorry. We'll uh, we'll leave you alone.",pam
41534,"When Holly gets here, I want you to be very helpful to her.",michael
41536,"She doesn't need an internet presence, you just know.",michael
41539,What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the courthouse.,michael
41546,"And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions.",michael
41548,"[standing outside, dials Dwight's cell phone]",jim
41549,[voicemail recording] You've reached the voice mail of Dwight Kurt Schrute. Please leave... [Jim hangs up and turns for the door. It is pad locked. Jim turns as Dwight springs from a nearby snowman and pelts him with snowballs.],dwight
41550,Ahhhhhhh!!!! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!,dwight
41551,Stop! Stop!,jim
41552,Ahh!,dwight
41553,Oh... oh!,jim
41554,"[grunting, shouting]",dwight
41555,I have no feeling in my fingers or penis. But I think it was worth it.,dwight
41556,"[dumps the remainder of the snow in his bag on Jim, then rests his foot on Jim and raises his arms in the air] Haahh!! [runs off]",dwight
41557,"Um, I was laying on the ground, defenseless, and uh, he just kept throwing 'em until he exhausted himself. And, uh, [cell phone chimes] then... [reading text message] 'How 'bout icing it? lol. Dwight.'",jim
41562,"There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God's sake?",michael
41564,Hello.,michael
41566,"[imitating her accent] Well, I never thought I'd see your face around these parts, you old bastard.",michael
41568,"[as Curly] Why, you're some sorta wise guy, huh?",michael
41570,"Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!",michael
41572,[as Homer] D'oh!,michael
41574,Okay... Holly's back.,jim
41575,Hi. Hi. Oh... [they hug],michael
41577,"Oh no, not the huggy monster! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! [both sigh] Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly.",michael
41581,That's adorable.,michael
41585,"Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party.",michael
41587,"Isn't it wonderful? We love it here. Don't you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk. [in a stereotyped Mexican accent] I show you to your desk.",michael
41589,What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?,michael
41590,Aww...,jim
41592,This is weird. I can't believe you're here. This feels like you never left. Doesn't it?,michael
41594,Oh...,michael
41596,"Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah! [the both chuckle] Oh, I love toy...",michael
41598,"Well, that's understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character?",michael
41600,You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy's mom.,michael
41602,"Because without Andy's mom, there's no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie.",michael
41604,You're kidding me. Ahh!,michael
41606,What a douche bag!,michael
41608,Get a... yeah! Good riddance.,michael
41610,Mmhmm.,michael
41612,Good for him.,michael
41614,Really? That's creepy. How did AJ get in your house?,michael
41616,"Oh, you do?",michael
41618,"[fighting back tears] Yeah, Randy Newman's the best.",michael
41620,Me too.,michael
41621,"[singing] Christmas tree, Christmas tree. Won't you be my Christmas tree.",andy
41622,"Hey, how about this one?",pam
41623,"Ehh, seems a little full of itself, right? Kind of a pretty boy? What if we got a really beat up one, like on Charlie Brown. And we just loved it for what it is?",andy
41624,Maybe. I mean...,pam
41626,"Um, hey, Darryl, listen, it's none of my business, but if I couldn't have Cece for Christmas, I'd be really upset too.",pam
41627,"I don't have kids or anything, but if my grandmother ever dies, I'm going to kill myself.",andy
41629,"Well Darryl, no kid wants to buy their own Christmas presents.",pam
41631,"No, you should have her mom do the boring Christmas stuff on her time. You should be associated with the fun parts of Christmas.",pam
41633,"Bring her to the party. Yeah, we'll have Santa, and we'll play games with her. It'll be a lot of fun.",pam
41634,Yes.,andy
41635,You'll be Mr. Christmas by the end of the night.,pam
41636,"Hey guys, the tree's here.",pam
41637,Hey.,michael
41638,"Nobody hug me, I'm covered in tree sap, so...",andy
41640,"Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I'm Santa Claus. Welcome.",michael
41642,It's a sophisticated take.,michael
41645,"Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled.",michael
41646,Who told you that?,pam
41647,"Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.",michael
41653,"Kelly! Um, how are you adjusting to the move?",pam
41655,"You guys, I don't think any of us are really qualified to be giving Holly personal advice about her love life.",pam
41659,"Wow, an ultimatum.",pam
41661,It doesn't really seem like you.,pam
41663,[turns in Pam's chair with a Pam wig on and laughs maniacally],dwight
41664,"Don't. Stop, Dwight! [Dwight pelts Jim with snowballs] Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!",jim
41665,"Oh, no. Oh, no!",dwight
41666,Stop!,jim
41667,"Oh, no. Yes, taste my wrath!",dwight
41668,Okay. Okay. Okay.,jim
41669,Huh? You like that?,dwight
41670,Seriously!,jim
41671,Huh?,dwight
41672,Okay. Okay. [Dwight throws another snowball and laughs maniacally],jim
41673,"Yes, I have a wig for every single person in the office. You never know when your gonna need to bear a passing resemblance to someone.",dwight
41674,I just want it to stop.,jim
41675,"So, cool right?",pam
41677,Okay.,pam
41679,"Okay, well, I just sorta meant, like, cute, right?",pam
41681,"I mean, help, if it's something simple, like add page numbers or laminate it or...",pam
41683,No.,pam
41686,"Hey, Toby.",jim
41688,No way.,jim
41690,That's increadible.,jim
41692,You know what's crazy?,jim
41694,"I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second. [he hurls a snowball at Dwight with a lacrosse stick, misses, and shatters a window, everyone gasps] Excuse me. [clears throat]",jim
41695,"I guess there are just some people who you stay together with when you transfer, and some people you don't. And that's just the way it is. And I can be mature about that. [clip of Michael throwing Holly's Woody in the trash and pouring coffee on it]",michael
41700,"What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic.",michael
41701,I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.,dwight
41702,What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me.,jim
41703,"With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.",dwight
41705,"All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk? [he holds up a toy taxi cab] Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City.",michael
41706,"Wait, what girlfriend?",dwight
41707,I haven't told you about her.,michael
41708,I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.,dwight
41709,"I'm a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that's pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, 'Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab.'",michael
41711,I do. She is.,michael
41712,Did you see her face? Well it seems to me that there is a person sitting out there in the annex that still has feelings for Michael G. Scott. And it ain't Tara.,michael
41714,Yup.,pam
41716,"No, no. Jim had a great year, actually. I just wanted to get your opinion.",pam
41718,Look at this.,pam
41723,"What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting.",michael
41725,"Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn't that nice? Thank you very much.",michael
41727,It is Christmas.,michael
41729,"Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed.",michael
41730,Why would anyone frame you for that?,andy
41731,"Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole 'Woody came to life' thing so quickly?",jim
41732,"Ahhhhhh! [laughs] Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?",michael
41734,[laughs] I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids...,michael
41735,Yikes. [everyone gasps],jim
41737,Dear God in heaven.,dwight
41738,"All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings.",michael
41740,"Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought.",michael
41741,"Okay, hey, hey, hey...",dwight
41742,"No, fake girlfriends are always wrong.",jim
41744,"When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, 'Michael, I love you, but I can't do this.' But then, with this other guy, you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me.",michael
41746,And we did this whole stupid party for you.,michael
41751,"Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?",michael
41753,"[walks over to his desk and sees a present sitting on it, reading the note] 'Hey, Pickles, Merry Christmas. Open immediately. Love, Swiss Cheese.' [opens the present and a snowball shoots out at him, everyone laughs] Damn it, Dwight!",jim
41754,"Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.",dwight
41761,"Jada, Darryl, I'm so glad I found you guys. A grinch stole the star from on top of the Christmas tree and is hiding it in the warehouse somewhere. You want to go help me find him?",pam
41762,"Oh, my goodness.",pam
41763,I am the mean old grinch. The little girl who wishes to win back the Christmas star must first succeed at these challenges.,andy
41766,Wahhh...,andy
41767,"Something like an obstacle course, Mr. Grinch?",pam
41768,No. You must answer topical political questions. How many congressmen is the state of Pennsylvania guaranteed? And what other state has the equal number?,andy
41770,Do you know the other state?,andy
41772,"The star has been hidden. Is the little girl hot or cold? Well, it turns out she's burning up because the star is right behind her ear! [pulls star from coat and pretends to find it behind Jada's ear]",andy
41795,Hey,michael
41797,"Nice to see you again, AJ. Welcome.",michael
41799,Good trip down?,michael
41801,"Good, good. Good to see you. Have fun. Enjoy the partay.",michael
41802,I am dead inside.,michael
41809,Thank you.,pam
41841,"[Jim hits a ceiling panel] I don't think he's in the ceiling, babe.",pam
41842,"Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright. [Jim hands Pam a present]",jim
41843,Is it... is it pebbles from that beach in Jamaica? [she shakes it],pam
41844,"Ooh, go easy with the shaking.",jim
41845,"[lifting up a diamond bracelet] Oh, my God.",pam
41846,You like it?,jim
41847,I love it.,pam
41848,"Yup, I do make great Christmas gifts. But I couldn't make that.",jim
41849,"Alright, my turn.",jim
41850,"Oh, um, it's just, I didn't, I didn't have a lot of time, so that's just a place holder.",pam
41851,"Right. Of course. [reading the comic book] 'The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert.' Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter.",jim
41852,I mean... [speechless],jim
41853,"Michael, wait!",pam
41854,"Oh, hey, hey, no, don't run. You're gonna slip.",michael
41855,That's good advice.,pam
41856,"Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.",michael
41857,That's a sad story.,pam
41858,"[voice breaking] Yeah, well, at least he was married.",michael
41859,"Oh, okay, Michael, slow down. Everything's gonna be okay.",pam
41860,"No, it's not. It's not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay.",michael
41861,"I shouldn't tell you this, but... AJ won't commit to Holly. And she's gonna tell him that if he doesn't propose to her by the end of the year, it's over.",pam
41862,Really?,michael
41863,"Really. And I don't know about you, but I don't know of a lot of happy marriages that start off with an ultimatum, do you?",pam
41864,No.,michael
41865,So just be patient.,pam
41866,"Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don't want you to fall.",michael
41867,I surrender.,jim
41868,I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent.,dwight
41869,Anything. You got it.,jim
41870,You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.,dwight
41871,You're a psychopath.,jim
41872,I'll take that as a no.,dwight
41873,"I was in the mall, and I saw that, and I thought it had your name written all over it.",michael
41875,"No, that's not... no, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you.",michael
41877,[hands Kelly a receipt from his wallet] From the mall. That...,michael
41879,"Well, that...",michael
41891,Hey.,michael
41893,Oh.,michael
41895,Thank you. A Hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much.,michael
41898,"Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn't he say that?",michael
41900,I think I know where he is.,michael
41902,Mmhmm.,michael
41904,Video games.,michael
41906,A DSi?,michael
41908,A horse.,michael
41910,"You, are you sure you don't want a pony? You want a real horse?",michael
41912,All right. You have to pick up after them.,michael
41913,"Hey, sorry. I'm ready.",pam
41914,I don't want to go.,jim
41915,"Oh... come on, bear man. Come on. [the lights flicker]",pam
41916,Have you ever seen 'em do that? [walk outside and the parking lot is covered with snowmen],jim
41917,I'm sorry. I had no idea.,pam
41918,"No, it's, it's okay. Okay.",jim
41919,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.",pam
41920,Okay. This is it.,jim
41921,What?,pam
41922,Go! Go! Go!,jim
41923,"What? What is it? What? What is, oh, my God! [Jim starts attacking snowmen] Honey? Jim? Jim!",pam
41924,"In the end, the greatest snowball isn't a snowball at all. It's fear. Merry Christmas.",dwight
41926,"Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey!",dwight
41927,Oh.,jim
41928,This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.,dwight
41929,"Knights of the Night are volunteer crime patrollers. We're often compared to the Guardian Angels, but we could not be more different from them. Seriously, we are nothing like the Guardian Angels. I mean, broad strokes purposes, sure. Think Guardian Angels.  One of our many recent good deeds? We set out to capture the Scranton Strangler. Mission accomplished. Not by us.",dwight
41930,"I'm actually just looking for my Blackberry, so, carry on.",jim
41931,"No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha... screw you!",dwight
41933,"What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leader's weird voice? Huh? [mimicking the leader's voice] Dwight, don't be bothered by the [mumbles]. Over the line, Jim.",dwight
41934,"I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here.",jim
41935,"Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That's our official name, Jim.",dwight

To Holly, it's been the worst week of her life, and I know for a fact that there was a week for her in high school when she got mono and her first period ever. Too much information?

42562,Sure we do.,michael

42566,"Yeah, I understand. I just don't agree.",michael

42596,Someone's in a bad mood.,jim
42597,"No I'm not. I'm not in a bad mood. I'm not, Jim. Hello? Ok fine, ignore me. Have it your way. Let's just talk about you, as always. Is sex different after the baby, Jim?",michael
42598,"Alright, let me turn on some music.",jim

42600,No you don't.,jim
42601,"Yeah, I do. My word against yours.",michael

42619,"Hey it's me. So uh, don't worry. Everything's ok.",jim
42620,What's wrong?,pam

42624,Oh God! What?!,pam

42626,Ok. She's ok?,pam
42627,"Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet.",jim
42628,Understood.,pam
42629,And his wallet and phone are on the seat next to me.,jim
42630,Got it. I will put out a A.P.B. Otherwise known as a 'Ask Pam Beasley'. ... Did the phone cut off?,pam

42653,"Yeah, which one?",andy
42654,Well the first one has a surprise factor. 'I'm a suck suck-suckidy Sabre!',pam
42655,Boo-yea! [office laughs],andy
42657,"But, ah, I suppose the second one is the better written line.",pam
42664,"You guys, if I knew you wanted to do a caption contest, I would have drawn something more challenging.",pam
42666,You?,andy
42668,Oh it is on like Genghis Khan wearing Sean Jean in Buton.,andy

42680,[at puppies] Hey you guys. Listen to me. Don't get hung up on just one girl because there are a whole lot of other girls out there. Look over there. See? They look cute. [at parrots] Hello! You guys are so beautiful. You're so colorful. I wish I could understand you. That's a metaphor I guess. [at snake] You are disgusting. You'll never find love. Yekkk.

42681,"[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.",pam
42682,Has Michael checked in?,dwight
42683,"Oh, hey Dwight.",pam
42684,I asked you a question.,dwight
42685,"No, he hasn't.",pam
42686,Goodbye.,dwight
42687,"No, wait. Hey, while you are out, could pick up some paper towels and chocolate syrup? We have ice cream so I thought...",pam
42688,"Pam, this isn't a shopping trip.",dwight
42690,This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.,dwight
42691,"Ok. I, just, when you are done or any time it's convent, I just thought since you are out...",pam
42692,"Pam, I'm obviously going to get that stuff for you so just shut up.",dwight
42693,"Ok, well it wasn't obvious so... [phone hangs up]",pam
42694,No word from Michael.,dwight

42724,Well I understand that but this is a $45 watch.,michael
42726,With that I can buy... half the menu.,michael
42728,All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you don't sell?,michael
42730,"Well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why don't you just throw one away now into my mouth?",michael
42732,Okay. You've just lost my business.,michael
42733,Hey.,dwight
42735,There's too many brands. Where's Holly?,dwight

42751,Okay. I'll be right back. [goes to leave but walks back]. Okay. You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't have my wallet and I was gonna try to dine and dash and that was stupid and I realize I can't do that to you fine people.,michael
42753,"Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.",michael
42755,Well the number three is not such a giant feast.,michael
42757,"Okay, all right. You know what?",michael
42759,I am not. I just have had a bad day.  And I... okay. I'll be back later with the money. I'm just gonna leave right now.,michael

42782,Oooohhh.,andy
42786,Do the next one.,andy
42796,"Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner.",pam
42804,"Do you see a little clown that you want to follow, huh? Is there a little bird that's chirping to you, 'this way, this way'?",dwight
42806,"Okay, close your eyes, we need you to think. What is Michael seeing right now? Can you tell him that we miss him? Michael we're coming for you!",dwight
42808,All right then. Someone propose a plan.,dwight
42810,"Not you, Erin.",dwight
42812,That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. No. Tap into your common mind and tell us what he would do next.,dwight
42815,"Right.  I can do this on my own. I can think like Michael. All right... I'm deep below the ocean's surface in a submarine. A torpedo's coming right at me. No. Damn it, that's just my own imagination.  Maybe he's bowling.",dwight
42817,Hi. [laughs] How did you know I was up here?,michael
42819,I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin.,michael
42821,Yeah. [laughs] Wow. I just miss you so much.,michael
42823,Really?,michael
42825,Can I kiss you?,michael
42827,Okay.,michael
42832,Oh! [laughter],andy
42835,[laughs],andy
42838,Hey. How you doing?,pam
42840,Yeah.,pam
42842,"At least she lived a very long and I'm sure, a very happy life. Got you this card. When you're ready. We all signed it. We just wanted you to know we're thinking about you.",pam
42844,It's possible that some people thought it was your birthday.,pam
42846,Birthday punches! [softly punching Darryl in the stomach] One two three four five sice seven eight!,andy
42847,I'm so sorry.,pam
42849,...thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-two twenty-three twenty-four twenty-five twenty-six!...,andy

42860,Don't go. I don't want you to go. Oh don't go. Don't go.,michael
42861,"Holly and I are dating. It's been a week, and I still can't believe it. [sighs] It goes to show that everything you want in life, you get. And you can't work for it. It just comes to you.",michael
42874,[rubbing hands with Holly] Are these numbers correct?,michael
42876,Okay.,michael
42878,"Are you... are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? 'Cause you're grossing me out.",michael
42880,[getting out of a taxi] There you go. Thanks.,jim
42881,How much did you give him?,pam
42882,Big tip.,jim
42883,Wait. I don't have my scarf.,pam
42884,What?,jim
42885,I'm missing my scarf. Oh. [both laugh],pam
42886,We decided to have a Valentine's day lunch and then that way we can spend the entire night with Cece and avoid the Valentine's day dinner thing. It's a whole thing.,jim
42887,"[loudly] Yeah, lunch was wonderful!",pam
42888,Shh.,jim
42889,"Um, there was an amazing buffet and there was a chocolate fondue... station. And what else was there?",pam
42890,"Um, bottomless champagne.",jim
42891,"Yes. Never found that bottom, did we?",pam
42892,No.,jim
42894,What's up?,andy
42896,Are you kidding me? It's all I did every summer when my brothers were out sailing.,andy
42898,"But if there is a romantic thing with Gabe, I should probably...",andy
42900,"Well, okay then.",andy
42902,At least until Stanley calms down.,andy
42904,D...d...d...d...don't look. I accidentally did his Sudoku. [Stanley glares at Andy],andy
42906,"[on phone] All right, I will fax over it to you. Whoop. I will fax it over to you. Okay. Thank you. [chuckles]",jim
42907,"Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really. [clears throat]",dwight
42908,[goes to hand Dwight a valentines card] Wait.,jim
42909,You're just filling that out right now. That wasn't meant for me. I will not be your Valentine.,dwight
42910,"Aww, nuts. [laughs]",jim
42929,"She's neat. Uh, I met her at Darryl's cousin's party. We were the only two white people there.",andy
42931,"Hey, look at that. Done.",andy
42933,I wish you well on your quest.,andy
42935,"Aww, I mean...",andy
42937,Okay.,andy
42940,"Sit. Okay, just close your eyes. [massaging Holly's back]",michael
42942,"Oh, yeah.",michael
42946,[clears throat],michael
42948,"[sitting in Holly's lap] Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting?",michael
42950,Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on.,michael
42955,OOH! Boom! Face!,jim
42957,Yeah. What? Us?,pam
42959,Did it!,jim
42960,Yeah!,pam
42961,Love it. Keep it goin.,jim
42970,"What, are you talking about me and Holly?",michael
42971,Yeah!,pam
42977,Whispering and tickling have their place in business.,michael
42979,"I... Okay, yeah, that's pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it.",michael
42980,Michael. Confession: I have done PDA in the office.,dwight
42981,Thank you.,michael
42982,I've had intercourse in the office.,dwight
42983,All right.,michael
42984,As has Angela!,dwight
42986,As has Ryan. As has Kelly. As has Meredith. As has Phyllis. As has Darryl. As has Creed. [Creed smiles and nods] As has Michael and as has Holly.,dwight
42990,Okay. Fine. No more PDA.,michael
42992,You win. But here's what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.,michael
42994,Anything goes.,michael
42996,"Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time?",dwight
42997,"Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we're gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?",michael
42998,And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?,dwight
42999,Pro.,michael
43000,Yes!,dwight
43001,What? Problem solved.,michael
43002,"No, no, it's great. I love working at Dunder Mifflin, a division of Taliban enterprises.",michael
43003,"That's weird. I mean, that's weird to have sex in the office. That's where you work, right?",pam
43004,Mm-hmm.,jim
43005,"You know, you're in a meeting, and nobody knows that you've had sex there, except for you and him.",pam
43006,[snorts] Ew.,jim
43010,Whoa.,andy
43012,[softy] We should actually probably talk about it outside or we might make Darryl mad.,andy
43014,I think he can hear us.,andy
43015,"[softly] That makes sense, 'cause I feel like I'd be able to hear us at this level.",andy
43017,Darryl is a jerk.,andy
43019,"No, I'm just testing if he can hear.",andy
43021,Oh. Okay.,andy
43024,The temp at night?,andy
43027,Pi...,andy
43029,Okay.,andy
43031,Right. Okay.,andy
43033,"Ah, the old 'leave behind.' Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it's working.",michael
43035,"Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don't... I don't sit on your lap because it's comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt.",michael
43037,"Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we'll stop.",michael
43039,Holly and I are like Romeo and Juliet. And this office is like the dragon that kept them apart.,michael
43040,"Hey, you know why people here are complaining? They are jealous of two people in love on Valentine's Day.",michael
43042,I love you.,michael
43044,I love you-love you.,michael
43046,I am really disappointed in the office's policy on PDA at this moment. I love you. [shakes Holly's hand],michael
43048,"Yeah, whatever. No big deal. Just the hottest girl in the world loves me.",michael
43049,"Okay, Ryan's the temp. What does he do at night?",andy
43051,"Oh, or maybe not. [turns out the lights]",andy
43053,How romantic is this?,andy
43055,Right. Do you see a clue or...,andy
43057,"Oh, my gosh.",andy
43061,No time to chat.,andy
43063,"Well, we were just looking for Ryan, so he's not here.",jim
43065,"Oh, yeah, we were. We were just looking to say hi. So hey.",pam
43067,"No, we weren't.",pam
43069,No.,pam
43070,Definitely not. That's disgusting.,jim
43072,"Hey, you don't have to...",jim
43073,That was so embarrassing. I'm gonna die.,pam
43074,That was really rough.,jim
43075,Let me make something clear. Jim and I have never and will never have sex in the office.,pam
43076,"No, because the office isn't what I'd consider a romantic place.",jim
43077,"Besides, we have something those other people don't have, which is a home and a bed.",pam
43078,And a shower.,jim
43079,"Hello, Holly.",michael
43081,"Here, shake. No!",michael
43083,"No, we can't.",michael
43085,"No touching. Ah, I'm trying not to touch you.",michael
43087,Oh.,michael
43089,"Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can't do that. We can't do this. Ohh.",michael
43091,I don't know what your body feels like 'cause I can't touch it.,michael
43094,Grab you here.,michael
43096,I will grab you here anyway. [laughs],michael
43099,Never.,michael
43101,"I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can't stop. You don't what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained.",michael
43105,"Yes, it was that. It's that one.",michael
43108,We're not supposed to PDA.,michael
43110,I haven't thought about you having to go back to Nashua.,michael
43112,That's what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How's this gonna be any different?,michael
43114,I was in love with you.,michael
43116,"[chuckles, sighs]",michael
43119,Hey.,andy
43124,Hey. Hey. Come on. You're hurting him.,dwight
43125,It's like a time bomb...,michael
43126,Shh.,dwight
43127,"...is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging.",michael
43128,Just hush.,dwight
43129,Sexual time bomb.,michael
43130,Just rock. Shh.,dwight
43131,[into recorder] Boner Bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera.,michael
43132,Movie idea?,dwight
43133,No. [into recorder] Saving the world has never been this hard.,michael
43134,Okay. Shh. Have you talked to her about your feelings? Women really go for that crap.,dwight
43135,"No, I can't talk to her. I can't even look at her without thinking about it ending.",michael
43136,Kevin! Do more stupid faces.,dwight
43138,I don't know.,dwight
43139,Do the monkey face.,michael
43140,Do the monkey face!,dwight
43141,I love that. I love that face.,michael
43142,Good. He loves it. Good. Jump. Jump up and down.,dwight
43143,No. The monkey!,michael
43144,Go back to the monkey!,dwight
43145,Don't do the squirrel. Throw your poop.,michael
43146,Hurl your feces.,dwight
43147,That's good.,michael
43148,Good.,dwight
43149,That's good. He's throwing it.,michael
43150,They really do that.,dwight
43151,I know.,michael
43153,B-9.,andy
43155,"Maybe it's just more like, 'be mine.'",andy
43157,Mm.,andy
43159,Hmm. [points to Gabe blowing a kiss to Erin],andy
43160,Holly. Hey.,michael
43162,"Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think we need to break up.",michael
43164,"Actually, it's Valentine's Day. Shouldn't be doing this today. I'll talk to you tomorrow.",michael
43166,"You're gonna go back to Nashua eventually, and I can't handle it. So let's just...let's...",michael
43168,Who?,michael
43170,Okay. Okay.,michael
43171,"Ladies and gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. As of today, officially, Holly and I are moving into together. Yay! [claps] Thank you. Thank you. Oscar, this must be tough for you, watching this go down. You could not stand in the way of true love, my friend!",michael
43174,"Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentine's Day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu.",michael
43176,I do.,michael
43180,What?,jim
43181,No.,pam
43182,No. We took a walk.,jim
43183,We took a walk.,pam
43184,"My perfect Valentine's Day? I'm at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the 50 restaurant reservations I made over six months ago.",dwight
43188,What are our plans for tonight? Umm...,michael
43190,"After three years of writing, one year of shooting, four years of re-shooting and two years of editing, I have finally completed my movie, Threat Level: Midnight.",michael
43191,Erin... what are you doing?,michael
43193,"That's... That's. Well, don't put words in my mouth.",michael
43194,Threat Level: Midnight is the great lost film of Michael Scott.,jim
43195,"We're all in it, from like years and years ago. It's like a home movie.",pam
43196,"Yeah, if Michael Scott did your home movie!",jim
43197,"Michael screened a work in progress for us, years ago, and it didn't go well. We thought it was a comedy. [flashback clip of Michael angrily leaving the conference room while the whole office is laughing at the tv] Everything pointed to it being a comedy.",pam
43198,We'd love to see it!,pam
43199,"Sweet, I will go invite Holly.",michael
43200,"Okay everyone, I know we're really excited to see this movie that everybody's in, but we have to remember that Michael is sensitive, so let's stay positive! And no laughing, no comments, just positive energy and we'll have a pure fun day! Okay?",pam
43203,"Mhmm! It's got action, it's got heart, it's got some bosom.",michael
43205,It's got a lot of me.,michael
43207,"Ladies and gentleman, Threat Level: Midnight. [applause]",michael
43208,"I play Samuel, Michael Scarn's robot butler. I wanted Samuel's voice- [robot impression] to be like this! [normally] But Michael thought that Samuel should be a very advance android, almost indistinguishable from a real person.",dwight
43209,Dwight does not play a robot.,michael
43211,I did not love the dialogue. Or the character.  I took the role to impress a receptionist who will remain nameless.,jim
43212,He cut the part where my circuit board malfunctioned! What was the point of spilling the drink on me?,dwight
43214,"By far and away, the most expensive shot in the movie. But, it was integral to the story.",michael
43215,That was not scripted.,michael
43217,"[cracking up at the stupidity of it, the rest of the office besides Michael and Holly are concealing their laughter. Pam Is trying to quiet Jim up] Sorry.",jim
43218,"[turns off the movie from the remote, the office complains]",michael
43219,"I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.",jim
43224,"[to Holly] Well that's a... pretty good reaction. [Holly nods] Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?",michael
43226,"Okay. [Stands up and leaves the conference room to the dismay of the office] No, it's not good enough. It's not good enough...",michael
43227,Some people are really popping on screen!,andy
43228,Hey.,michael
43230,"Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great!",michael
43232,Did you? What did you love about it?,michael
43234,"No, no. Holly, this isn't Ocean's Eleven, where you get together with all your friends and just have fun and don't care about how it turns out. What'd you really think, honestly.",michael
43236,"Is it, is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded.",michael
43238,"[angrily] It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream.",michael
43240,"I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus.",michael
43242,"Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing.",michael
43244,"I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.",michael
43246,"Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass. And I'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great! And I'm sorry I called you a pain in the ass, I'm angry, and I love you.",michael
43248,"I am a huge Woody Allen fan. Although I've only seen Antz, but I'll tell you something. What I respect about that man, is that when he was going through all that stuff that came out in the press, about how Antz was just a rip-off of A Bug's Life, he stayed true to his films.  Or at least the film that I saw which again was Antz. The thing is... I thought Bug's Life was better, much better. Than Ants. The point is, don't listen to your critics, listen to your fans.",michael
43249,Who likes Threat Level: Midnight? [applause from the office] Okay then who wants to watch the rest?! [everyone yells approval],michael
43250,"We filmed this during an actual Scranton High School Hockey Game, trying to qualify for states.",michael
43251,"[he office shushes Michael to hear the movie better] That's fine, it's great!",jim
43252,"No, no! Actually it's really screwed up because they [chuckles], they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. That's why there were so many people there. [Michael stands up, clearly realizing that his movie is not as great as he thought]",michael
43253,Hey...,michael
43255,"No it's not. [kisses Holly while smiling] It's not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it.",michael
43256,[laughs at the stupidity],michael
43257,"Oh yeah, I guess I did let him be a robot.",michael
43258,[the office cheers] Whoa Whoa Whoa! Isn't the president evil?,andy
43259,Oh yeah! [laughs] Yes he is!,michael
43260,"No no, he's doing it to catch the president!",dwight
43261,"No, no Dwight. He's just being stupid. [the office laughs]",michael
43262,I have the best survival stock shelter in north eastern Pennsylvania. But everything has a shelf-life. So I must eat and replace everything that's about to expire. It's nice not to have to plan my meals.,dwight
43264,They're still good for another week.,dwight
43267,"Hardy har har. Okay picture this: Snowy ash drizzles from the sky. A ravenous pack of dogs surrounds you as the flame at the end of your stick dies out. There's only one hope left for you. The door to my shelter. You pound, you beg, Dwight! Please let me in! But I ignore your cries and do not let you in. You wanna know why?",dwight
43268,"Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.",jim
43269,"No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.",dwight
43270,Three months.,jim
43271,Could be.,dwight
43272,Four months.,jim
43273,"I can see that happening, yes.",dwight
43274,Eight months?,jim
43275,That's a realistic time line.,dwight
43276,[Pam kisses Jim on the cheek] Eleven months.,jim
43277,Perhaps.,dwight
43278,Okay now really think hard about this one:  One year.,jim
43279,I can see that as a very real possibility.,dwight
43280,"[time has obviously passed, as everyone is gone except Jim and Dwight] Four hundred and ninety-four months?",jim
43281,I can see that happening.,dwight
43282,Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That's just...,jim
43284,Still not seeing the problem here.,michael
43286,"It was the best of times, it was the awesomest of times. And now Packer wants to come home. And ohh, look who's here to sign off on it! My boo, Holly.",michael
43288,Hi. [Holly and Michael kiss],michael
43293,"Oh, Michael! This'll be just us.",michael
43294,"Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him five shots.",michael
43296,And it also helps if you've had five shots.,michael
43298,Whoa!,michael
43299,[to Michael] Why is Packer back?,jim
43300,Is Packer here?,michael
43301,Why's he talking to Holly?,dwight
43302,"[peering into conference room] Don't know, don't care.",michael
43305,"[sees Holly and Todd shaking hands in the conference room] Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldn't be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.",michael
43307,What!?,jim
43310,"You did! You got burned, because Packer's back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.",michael
43311,"[seething] Holly, you approved this?",dwight
43313,You did approve it?,jim
43320,"I got Erin a new computer, because the one at reception sucked. I should know. And I don't wanna say the other one was old, but its I.P. number is one! [laughs sheepishly] Right?",pam
43322,"Awwh, you're welcome. [they hug] My pleasure.",pam
43323,"[Pam walks over to him and smiles excitedly while bouncing, Jim imitates her] Can I do something for ya?",jim
43324,I just helped someone out. It feels good.,pam
43325,"Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...",jim
43326,So you know the feeling.,pam
43327,Special delivery for Dwight K. Schrute.,michael
43328,I didn't order anything.,dwight
43329,And I don't have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we can't just sit around and wait for Creed to die.,michael
43330,Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.,dwight
43331,"So you wouldn't mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here. [Jim looks appalled]",michael
43333,"I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.",dwight
43335,No it is not.,dwight
43337,[Grunting as he crawls under Dwight's desk. Dwight follows] Let's look at this.,michael
43339,I don't wanna move desks!,dwight
43340,Don't be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! [Todd starts humping Dwight and Michael who are still under the desk.,michael
43341,Do I have any say in this?!,jim
43342,No!,michael
43344,"[in the annex, moving into his new desk. Holds up a red tray with rocks on it] Hey, who's dirt box is this?",dwight
43346,"What do you grow in here, bullcrap? [puts the tray into the garbage]",dwight
43347,"[walking into the annex with Jim] Hey, um...",pam
43350,"Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer?",jim
43352,He's seriously awful!,pam
43355,[Pam starts nodding in agreement] Why are you nodding?,jim
43356,United front...,pam
43362,"Well, I mean he humped Michael.",jim
43364,"[looking at his computer, gasps] Hey! Hey you guys! The Armeth Regado video is up, gather around! [no one moves] Check it out! This guy's on a full beam reach. [watching a sailing video on his computer] They're hiking out like mad! Lock 'em up! Lock 'em up! Nice job! Ughh. [computer is frozen, taps the top of it] This computer's a hunk of jjunk.",andy
43366,Where did you get this?!,andy
43368,"This is a sick computer! Gwen Stefani has this computer! [to Pam, in a fake British accent] Uhhh, Pamela! What does a guy have to do to get, ahem, one of them?",andy
43369,You have a computer Andy.,pam
43370,"Yeah, but if you donated my computer to Africa, it would become world famous as the slowest computer in Africa. So...",andy
43371,"Ok, but listen. We just don't have the budget for it. Okay? Reception needed a computer so we got one.",pam
43372,"Well Andy's desk needs a computer. And, I mean, it's just kinda a coincidence that I work there, but...",andy
43373,"Yes, but Reception is a one person department. If I get you a new computer I have to get one for everyone in sales. For Dwight, for Stanley, it would be crazy.",pam
43375,"I'm not asking for one, I need it.",andy
43377,"Phyllis, no body is handing anything out.",andy
43378,"See, this is what I'm talking about.",pam
43379,What are you gonna play mange on faster?,andy
43380,Sorry Andy.,pam
43391,"Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer.",dwight
43392,"[walking through the office, notices Andy with Erin's computer set up at his desk] What the heck! Why do you have Erin's computer!",pam
43393,"It's crazy, right? Erin just wanted me to have it, so we switched.",andy
43394,What? Erin is that true?,pam
43396,"Erin, it's not up to you. This computer was for reception! Okay? It's not yours to give away.",pam
43397,"Pam, when I'm freaking out, I just sorta step back and-",andy
43398,"I'm not freaking out, Andy.",pam
43399,"-take a few breaths, and then I ask myself: Is this worth freaking out about?",andy
43400,"Andy, why should she have your crappy computer?",pam
43401,That's interesting. So you also think my computer is crappy.,andy
43402,Switch the computers back Andy.,pam
43403,Seriously?,andy
43404,Seriously.,pam
43405,Pam! Come on!,andy
43406,Now please.,pam
43407,Fine! [the office goes back to their work] Please make sure no one is humping me!,andy
43409,Best day ever. Best day ever!,michael
43411,"Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?",michael
43413,Please.,michael
43415,"Yeah, You love him right? [Holly seems unsure] You love him. I can tell.",michael
43417,"No. Not me, him.",michael
43421,"Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he's funnier than you? Oh honey...",michael
43423,He's funnier than me.,michael
43425,So I'm less funny than not funny at all?,michael
43428,[seems taken aback] Uhm...,michael
43430,That's insane!,michael
43434,Yeah.,jim
43436,[continues working],jim
43437,"[walks towards Todd] Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.",dwight
43439,Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.,dwight
43440,That's a lot of reasons! [suspicious],jim
43441,Drink it!,dwight
43443,[interrupts Dwight trying to force feed Todd] Can I talk to you a second?,jim
43444,"So, this hot chocolate thing.",jim
43445,None of your business.,dwight
43446,"Well, you know you can't actually poison him.",jim
43447,"It wasn't poison Jim, it was a laxative. People take laxatives all the time. This is just, a lot more of a laxative. Let me handle this.",dwight
43448,I really think we should join forces on this one.,jim
43449,Really.,dwight
43450,"What do we think, what would drive him crazy.",jim
43451,I know.,dwight
43452,Here we go.,jim
43453,"Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate.",dwight
43454,"You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.",jim
43455,[mocking] Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?,dwight
43456,"Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.",jim
43457,Who is Justice Beaver?,dwight
43458,He... It's a crime fighting beaver.,jim
43459,Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?,dwight
43460,"Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred.",jim
43461,"Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I'll read it over.",dwight
43462,Pam. Can I talk to you in private?,andy
43463,I don't know if there's really a private place in this office.,pam
43464,Well they put a sign-up sheet on the conference room and I signed us up for three mods. A mod is five minutes. And it started two minutes ago.,andy
43465,[looking confused] You did that?,pam
43466,Can we talk about this in the meeting? Because we're a little late.,andy
43467,Okay. [walks to conference room with Andy and stares at the sign up sheet with wonder] When did people sign-,pam
43468,"Mind if I close the door? [after shutting door in the conference room] What you did out there, earlier, was totally un-cool.",andy
43469,"Well what was I supposed to do, let you walk all over me?",pam
43470,You humiliated me in front of every body!,andy
43471,"Okay, well I didn't think about it like that. It's just, I can't do anything about it. I can't replace that one unless that computer breaks.",pam
43472,"I mean, it's pretty broken already.",andy
43473,"Yeah, well if it breaks all the way I can get you a new one.",pam
43474,[looks at her knowingly] Pretty sneaky sis. [knocking on conference room door],andy
43476,"[to Jim, the two are alone in the annex] There are over four hundred of these! [indicating a packet of paper]",dwight
43477,Yeah I couldn't cut it down.,jim
43478,"They're all good. So good! Number three: eat a frog. That sounds promising. Number four: eat a dog. I don't know, um, from practical stand point-",dwight
43479,One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?,jim
43480,"Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen. [Dwight tries to open up a drawer on his desk but it only goes out two inches] Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.",dwight
43481,"[Andy is seen clicking random things and warning boxes pop up. He pours coffee on his keyboard, puts bologna with mustard in his CD drive, and many other computer harming things] Allow all cookies? Why certainly! Pop-ups? Yes please! Bit torrent streaming from a Somalian music website? Yeah! Why not? [mock baby voice] Oh I hope you don't get sick Mr. Computer. [computer voice] Why are you doing this to me Andy? [normal voice again] Because I hate your programs!",andy
43483,"And you made Hank smile, that doesn't happen often. You're very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter. [Hank looks irritated again]",michael
43485,"I don't know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin.",michael
43487,Yeah.,michael
43489,I guess you said something weird about your daughter?,michael
43491,"You've been on the road a long time. And you've been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can't be peeing all over the walls.",michael
43493,No it isn't.,michael
43495,"Yeah, a little bit.",michael
43497,I won't.,michael
43498,"[Michael and Todd are walking into the office] Okay, every body. I need you to see this. Because maybe there is somebody here that you all underestimated, who will surprise you. Todd Packer, is going to apologize. Kevin! Front and center, come here.",michael
43500,"Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.",michael
43502,"Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn't be apologizing to Packer. That doesn't make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.",michael
43505,"Kevin, do you accept the apology?",michael
43507,"Okay, go back to the annex.",michael
43512,"That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy. [Andy looks confused and shrugs] Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-",michael
43514,"I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we're through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!",michael
43515,"[in a car with Andy, by the dumpster you can see a new computer box] So listen, we have to really scuff this up.",pam
43516,"No no no no no! We can say that the previous owner was a neat-freak. Or an elegant old lady and she just kept it around in case her grand-kids came to visit, but they died and they never came, I think I'm gonna make myself cry.",andy
43517,"Andy, this is the deal we made.",pam
43518,[watching Pam scrap his computer] That's probably good. That's enough.,andy
43519,We should break this hinge maybe.,pam
43520,Let's not go crazy.,andy
43522,"[using fake Southern accent, on the phone with Todd Packer, Dwight is also with Jim] Absolutely, now when you get down there, Jo's a little bit, uh, forgetful. So she may have locked the gate, but what you're gonna do is go ahead, hop it, and just head back to the pool. [Michael walks in on Jim and Dwight]",jim
43524,"It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!",jim
43525,[also In southern accent] And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.,dwight
43526,[trying to stop him] Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!,jim
43527,Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!,dwight
43529,Check it out and have a free butterbeer on us. Keep the receipt and we'll get ya' back!,dwight
43530,What are you doing?,michael
43531,"[trying to hide from Michael what they're doing, he picks up the phone and talks directly into it] All right, so just pack your bags and, uh, be sure to bring those swimming trunks! Bye now! [hangs up]",jim
43532,"I cannot believe this, you're sending Packer to Florida? Why?",michael
43533,He's a jerk.,jim
43534,He took my desk.,dwight
43535,"Okay, so you're tricking him into flying to Florida?",michael
43536,"It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.",dwight
43537,You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.,michael
43538,"No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing.",dwight
43539,"He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him.",michael
43540,Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about? [Michael leaves],jim
43541,"[plugging in new computer, acting to make people think he got a bad computer] Pam, how is this thing even any better than my old computer?",andy
43542,Come on Andy! I mean you said you wanted a new computer and this is the best I could do!,pam
43543,"Where'd you even find this thing, like, in the corner in the warehouse?",andy
43544,"Yes, I found it in a shelf in the corner of the warehouse. [Darryl gives the camera an odd look]",pam
43545,"All right, well thank you for my garbage computer. [Andy turns it on and looks amazed, clearly happy with it]",andy
43547,"Yes, about that.",michael
43549,Well... I don't know if that's a good idea.,michael
43551,"No, nothing like that at all.",michael
43553,Sorry?,michael
43555,[thinks a moment] Sounds great.,michael
43557,That is. [Jim sees them and looks happy] It's gonna be awesome. I think you're really going to enjoy it down there.,michael
43559,"Nah, he's an ass.",michael
43561,[imitating] You ahh.,michael
43563,No you ahh.,michael
43565,[kisses her and speaks normally again] You ahh.,michael
43567,Yep. Lucked out.,pam
43569,"Yep, super lucky.",pam
43571,"[hesitating at the bribe] Yeah. You know what , I think I saw ONE sick day down there.",pam

43577,Oh.,pam
43578,"Dunder Mifflin is having our first own garage sale. Like many Americans, we realized we had a lot of things that we really didn't need. And 10 cents of every dollar is going into the party fund so we can throw parties for ourselves.",pam

And I would like to discuss my intentions with you... which are to ask her to marry me. And I was just hoping you would give me your approval. And this isn't a joke. So call me back, when you get this. And I look forward to speaking. Thank you.",michael
43623,"Oh, cause there's a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.",dwight
43625,People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and you're like 'Hey baby let me light a candle' then you pull out this one half used and he's like 'Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast.',dwight

43696,things are going very well. I traded a thumb tack for Meredith's junk for Kelly's crap for Phyllis' garbage for Oscars trash for Stanley's garbage for Ryan's junk for Creed's garbage for a very cute squid that Erin happened to have.,dwight
43697,"Jim, put those away.",dwight

43702,Why?,michael
43703,You called the meeting I don't..,pam
43704,I did?,michael
43705,Ok. Thank you all for coming. I would like to talk to you all today about... recycling.,michael

43708,We are a family.,pam
43709,I could not have agreed with you more.,michael
43710,"And I've always believed that we should all be involved in everyone's personal lives, in a very major way.",pam
43711,Yes. Thank you.,michael
43712,So about this proposal thing...,pam

43714,"Michael, she's perfect for you.",pam
43716,She's amazing. This is very exciting.,jim
43717,So we just... we wanna help you plan the proposal so that it's safe and responsible and realistic and doable.,pam
43718,I had a great idea until you ruined it.,michael
43720,"[playing the Dallas board game] Hmm, I'm gonna play me a little ol' black mail card .",andy
43722,And call a proxy meeting to take control of you and oil once and for all.,andy
43724,Why not. Seems to me we're just making up rules cause somebody forgot to staple the rules to the inside of the game like a normal human being.,andy
43726,Oooh.,andy
43730,Well played.,andy
43732,We must honorably adhere to the rules we are making up on the spot.,andy
43734,Well that's Dallas.,andy
43745,Ok I think animals and proposals are out. Right Ryan didn't you read in one of your blogs that animals are out?,pam
43747,"How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' I lost my head when I fell in love with you.'",michael
43748,That's a guarantee.,jim
43749,"It's easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.",michael
43750,Don't think you need the corpse then.,jim
43751,Heres the ring.,michael
43752,Holy s*** is that real?,pam
43753,Yeah. I saved 3 years salary.,michael
43755,Is she not going to like that?,michael
43756,No she's going to love it so I think you can keep the proposal simple. You know like when Jim proposed. He just he got down on one knee and he told me that he loved me and he asked me to marry him and it was perfect.,pam
43758,At a gas station. [oscar laughs],jim
43759,At a gas station?,michael
43760,Oh it was when she was working in New York so it was halfway between both of us.,jim
43761,That mush have been a surprise when... at the gas station you proposed.,michael
43762,No it was really it was really sweet. It was raining and..,pam
43763,Oh yea you didn't say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.,michael
43764,Totally reasonable.,jim
43765,I just... it's terrifying.,michael
43766,She's not gonna say no.,pam
43767,I know but I'm still scared I don't know why.,michael
43768,Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.,jim
43769,You were scared?,pam
43770,Yeah... it.s scary.,jim
43771,Get this... Kevin thought I was gonna sell my Bowflex for 200 dollars and I told him 'Dude this was a prop in my movie.',michael
43773,"Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything.",michael
43775,Oh ok. For how long?,michael
43777,Is he alright?,michael
43779,You ok?,michael
43781,"Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that.",michael

43785,"No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope.",michael
43787,No. I am not going to be proposed to in the break room. That is not going to be our story. Mhm hm. Should have burned this place down when I had the chance.,michael

43804,"All right, I'll take them.",dwight
43805,They're probably worthless.,jim
43806,Probably. [walks away with beans],dwight
43807,Leave the telescope.,jim
43808,"I started with a thumb tack and traded my way to a telescope. But in a way the most valuable thing here wasn't the telescope at all. No, it was this... packet of beans.  So I traded the telescope for it. And I can just go buy another telescope.",dwight
43809,"Hey, how'd we do?",michael
43811,That's great and we still have most of our stuff. Good.,michael
43813,"No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that.",michael
43815,Shhhh. Let's go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff.,michael
43816,So this is one of my favorite places in the world.,michael
43818,This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Let's go in here.,michael
43819,This is where we first kissed.,michael
43821,And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?,michael
43823,"Through these blinds is where I first saw you, and you had all these boxes, and I thought you were the prettiest mover I had ever seen. And I was sitting at this desk when I called you to tell you that I had herpes and that I was still in love with you and you said that it was over, and that you didn't love me. Thank goodness none of that was true. Including the herpes.",michael
43825,In-grown hair.,michael
43826,"Right in here... this is where we first co-ran our meeting. Remember, obesity awareness?",michael
43828,We saved a lot of lives that day. That's where you first met Michael Klump.,michael
43830,"And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it, you thought it was so wrong.",michael
43831,And over here..,michael
43833,"Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do. [runs water through hand]",michael
43835,Let's go in here.,michael
43837,"This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.",michael
43838,"Holly, will you marry me?",jim
43842,That guy's got more than he can handle as it is.,michael
43845,That marriage would be a sham.,michael
43848,Easy no.,michael
43851,That would be hot. I would pay to see that.,michael
43854,Only one that I was kind of worried about.,michael
43855,"[the area where Holly's desk is is filled with lit candles] This is where I fell in love with you. And this is where I ask you to marry me. It started with.. [fire sprinklers go on] Holly Flax, marrying me will you be?",michael

43926,Come on out!,michael
43928,"I am well, sir, how are you?",michael
43930,Did I want to be made manager? Sure. A great opportunity squandered? Absolutely. A crushing blow? Yes. Will I get over it? No. But life goes on. Not for me.,dwight
43940,"And we talk for like 20 minutes, no clue it's Deangelo the whole time!",michael
43943,"I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!",michael
43945,Oh yeah... I know... that's what I was just saying... that's what...,michael
43947,"That exact situation is why I always carry around some of these. [holds up 'Hello, my name is..,'] nametags. Just in case. Because sometimes you just need to I.D. yourself.",andy
43949,"I wasn't even trying to make a joke. But I guess I've always been sorta quirky, offbeat, a little twisted.",andy
43950,"This is Jim and Pam, aka Jap. What started as an affair has blossomed into a family before our eyes.",michael

43960,Thanks for meeting me.,dwight
43961,Are you kidding? I'd come anywhere to see a turtle? Where'd you find him.,michael
43962,"There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.",dwight

43965,Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I'll be off all day.,michael
43966,"I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. What's wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.",dwight

43987,I sorta like the old way.,michael

44177,Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it's all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay. [Ryan stands next to Michael up front] Ryan how are you today?,michael

44187,Why don't you think of hosting the Dundies like you're just running a meeting.,andy
44188,"No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!",michael
44189,"Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.",jim
44190,"Jim, please no loopholes.",michael
44192,"This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?",michael
44194,Good. Good. Good!,michael

44217,What?,pam
44218,I think you got this. Kay? [Erin nods] Alright. Feel better!,jim

44309,We're done. We're done!,michael
44310,"[Outside of the restaurant, obviously sad] So that is how it ends. My last Dundies ever. I was hoping it'd be more like Godfather Three. That rapped up the whole franchise in an extremely satisfying way. But instead it is like Godfather One! That was, very confusing, had maybe three big laughs. Oh well...",michael
44311,"Michael, we were thinking maybe we could keep this thing going!",pam
44312,What?,michael
44314,"No, no. You're being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time.",michael

44333,What is your problem?!,michael
44334,"I just don't see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.",dwight

44387,How do you mean?,michael
44388,"Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand? [Michael nods in agreement] You're like a giant walking salami!",dwight
44389,"Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?",michael

[to the side again] That's great, if I wanted the dictionary definition I'd buy a dictionary. [reading again, slowly gets sadder] I define it as Dwight Schrute.

[Gabe nods] A little cover-up on your Adam's apple will make it appear smaller, and make you look less like a transvestite. [Gabe looks awkward and Michael winks]",michael
44649,"Uh DeAngelo, I'm, uh. I forgot my bag, so I'll meet you in the car.",andy
44651,"[walks into the client's office again] Sir, I'd just like to apologize, for that. I could tell you that he has a steel plate in his head, or that he's crazy, but the truth is I think he's just a terrible salesman. And I want you to know, that if you re-up with us, anything you need, day or night, I will be the one to take your call.",andy
44654,[laughing] Hey! [they hug] Good job boss!,andy
44656,"[standing in front of his office, sees that it is three forty five] Okay, everybody come on. Conference room five seconds! Let's go! Hurry up, let's do this! [Dwight runs into the conference room. All others follow]",michael
44658,What is this meeting about?,michael
44660,"Okay, here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here, together, because I have something important. Well there's two things actually. Okay first, I would like a whereabouts on Pam. [Jim looks regretful] And secondly, Phyllis how are those mittens coming? Because I would actually like to bring them home and pack them. I'm leaving for the day at four.",michael
44662,[cutting her off] Well power through the arthritis Phyllis you can do it!,michael
44664,"Umm, hmm?",michael
44666,"[the office looks up expectantly] Ummm... Hm... No. [changing his mind] No. There's a special guest that I would like to invite to say one last goodbye. So here he comes, he's coming right in. [walks out and then back in, now using a Vietnamese accent] Oh hi everybody, it's Ping! [the office groans] And I'm here to say goodbye to all you wonderful people! Thank you everybody! You've been so wonderful! [only Kevin is laughing. Stanley tries to leave. Michael hugs him] I ruv you all! I ruv you very much!",michael
44667,"Hey, can I talk to you for a second?",jim
44668,Sure. [Ping accent] Be right out!,michael
44669,"[brings Michael into his office] So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.",jim
44670,[sad] Ohh...,michael
44671,"What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?",jim
44672,[holding back tears] Okay...,michael
44673,You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?,jim
44674,Maybe.,michael
44675,"Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good.",jim
44676,Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing?,michael
44677,Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.,jim
44678,"[pulls out a recorder and speaks softly into it] T-Shirt idea, goodbyes stink. Okay, alright. So. James Halpert. [starts to cry] You started with this company, as a fine young man...",michael
44679,You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.,jim
44680,"Oh, okay.",michael
44681,"And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had. [Jim is holding back tears too]",jim
44682,[hears a taxi honking] Oh shoot! That's my cab.,michael
44683,Alright.,jim
44684,Alright.,michael
44685,"Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but...",jim
44686,"I know, it's okay. Just, give her a hug. Alright?",michael
44687,"[shakes Michael's hand] I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.",jim
44688,I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am.,michael
44689,[chuckles] You got it.,jim
44690,Okay... [crosses Jim off his list] Phyllis.,michael
44692,"No no no, let me see. [picks up the mostly knitted mittens] Oh Phyllis, nice try. I love 'em. [waves goodbye to her with the mittens] [Michael begins walking out the office, he takes one last look at all his friends to see them working, and Jim looking back, teary eyed]",michael
44694,Later guys. [leaves the office],michael
44695,"Got almost everybody. So... Holly's my family now. [you see video of Michael getting into the cab, and driving off. As the cab leaves, Pam drives in] She's my family. The babies that I make with her, will be my children. The people that you work with, are just... when you get down to it... your very best friends. They say, on your deathbed, you never wish you spent more time at the office. But I will. Gotta be a lot better than a deathbed. [You see Michael getting out and entering the airport, and going through security] I actually don't understand deathbeds. I mean, who would buy that?",michael
44696,"[putting his shoes back on, talking to the camera crew] Well, I guess this is it. Hey will you guys let me know if this ever airs? Thank you. Alright... Oh! [pulls out his mic from his shirt] This is gonna feel so good, getting this thing off my chest. [he hands them the body mic, when he speaks it is inaudible now] That's what she said! [waves goodbye and walks off to his gate, halfway there Pam comes running up to him and they hug for a while. They say their goodbyes to each other, and Michael walks off for good]",michael
44697,"[watching Michael's plane take off. Crying and has smeared make up on] No he wasn't sad. He was full of hope. About Colorado, and he was hoping to get an upgrade as an award's member. And he said he was just real excited to get home and see Holly.",pam
44699,"[to Jim] Uh oh... [Jim, tearful, nods]",dwight
44714,"Good morning, Deangelo.",pam
44716,Okay.,pam
44718,Because of the flowers.,pam
44720,"Dogwoods, or just the Earth.",pam
44722,"Hey, well, good morning.  I think I have good news for you today.  I found your new executive assistant.  My friend Carla.  [looking at resume]  She's got great experience.  We even considered making her Cece's godmother, but she had this boyfriend at the time-- but here's her resume.",pam
44724,Okay.,pam
44726,Hey!,jim
44727,Hey!,andy
44728,"Oh my God, he hates me!",pam
44729,No he doesn't.  You just get so nervous and hyper around him.,jim
44730,I know.,pam
44731,"Every time there's a silence, your brain's like 'Heh-heh-huh-huh' [imitating crying].",jim
44732,Is that what he tells you at your little inner circle meetings?,pam
44733,Careful.  There is no inner circle.,jim
44734,"Oh, there's an inner circle.  Oh yeah.",andy
44735,"There is no inner circle.  Deangelo just prefers to delegate a few things, to a few guys.",jim
44738,"Oh, wow, thank you.  That was so kind of you.  [throws cup in the garbage]",dwight
44740,"It's just that I own the coffee shop.  So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun.",dwight
44742,I think you'll find what you're looking for [points toward Oscar] over there.,dwight
44749,"That's Toys R Us, I think.",jim
44771,Congratulations on your one cousin.  I have seventy.  Each one better than the last.,dwight
44773,"I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here.  Okay?  I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it.  Okay?",dwight
44775,What?,dwight
44777,No you're not.,dwight
44779,No.,dwight
44781,No.,dwight
44783,No.,dwight
44785,No.,dwight
44787,No.,dwight
44789,No.,dwight
44791,"[looking at resume] Uh oh, this former administrative assistant misspelled 'administrative' and 'assistant.'",jim
44794,Seriously?,jim
44801,"Oh no, do you think it was stolen?",pam
44802,"I gotcha covered, boss.  Used to play with the parabolas myself. [opens desk drawer and takes out balls]  Got some extra balls!  [throws them toward Deangelo, who dodges them]  Hey-hey-hey-ho!",andy
44804,"Oh wow, you weren't kidding.",pam
44813,[imitating Deangelo's pretend juggling routine] Look.  I'm juggling eggs and bowling balls.  I'm juggling with one hand.  No hands.,pam
44814,What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?,jim
44815,What could he possibly stand to gain from a real juggling routine?  How can you keep defending him?,pam
44816,He's good at his job.  And I like working for him.,jim
44818,"Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I think if he was sexist, I'd be able to tell.  I took a crapload of women's studies courses at Cornell.  And I wrote my own companion piece to the 'Vagina Monologues' called the 'Penis Apologies.'  So I know a thing or two.",andy
44820,How could I not see it?  You're so right.,andy
44821,[to Jim] Why don't you talk to him about it?,pam
44822,"And say what?  'Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?'",jim
44823,Why don't you just tell him how his actions are being perceived by the women in this office?,pam
44824,Mmm-hmm.,jim
44825,"And if he doesn't listen, then he can kiss his penis goodbye.  Snip snip.  Am I right, girls?",andy
44826,"Hey, you got a second?",jim
44829,"Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --",jim
44832,"If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --",jim
44834,"I know. [Gabe and Darryl stand on either side of Jim with paper and pens in hand]  Just the guys.  Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem.  I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads.  Uh, some of the female department heads.",jim
44837,"Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --",jim
44839,Whoa.  Whoa.  Wait.,jim
44841,Oh.  Like nobody.,jim
44843,It was --,jim
44847,That's awesome.,jim
44857,"Hey, who'd you end up hiring?",jim
44861,"What's the argument here?  NBA, WNBA.  One is a sport, one is a joke.  I love sports, I love jokes.  Room for all.",dwight
44864,"So, Jordan, uh, where did you work before?  Uh, a law office?",pam
44872,"So, umm, is this your first office job then?",pam
44875,Wow.,pam
44878,"Oh yeah, did he text us?",jim
44880,[holds up phone and looks into Deangelo's office] No!,dwight
44881,"Jim, what are you doing?  Get in there.  This is not the time to take a stand.  At least he likes one of us.",pam
44882,He didn't text me.  [Andy's phone chimes],jim
44883,Yes!  I'm in.,andy
44885,"I'm going in, into the belly of the beast.  Gonna infiltrate and change from within.  [joins the group in Deangelo's office]  What's up, mancave! [makes barking noises]",andy
44886,"[to Jim] Just go in.  Just go in, he probably forgot to text you.",pam
44888,"[to Jordan] Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest.",jim
44890,Yeah.,jim
44892,Nope.  Just... [Deangelo continues staring at him] Okay. [gets up and leaves office],jim
44893,"So, he kicked you out of the inner circle, huh?",dwight
44894,"Well, there is no inner...circle.",jim
44896,Really?  Anything.,dwight
44898,"Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone.",dwight
44899,"Okay, I do not want to waste your time, so I will keep this br-r-r-r-r-r-ief.  Now, word on the street is, Mercy Hospital, back on the market.  Deangelo would like you to put together a sales pitch for next week.  Deangelo has also recently learned about the Barnacle Project.  Which is a non-profit organization based in Mystic, Connecticut that assists in the scraping of barnacles --",andy
44900,So this is my life.  Until I win the lottery [laughs].  Or Pam finally writes that series of young adult books.,jim
44901,"So one afternoon, while walking home from school, quirky 10th grader Becky Walters finds a wounded Pegasus in the woods.  And she becomes...The Horse Flyer.",pam
44915,"[knocking on door to Deangelo's office as loud yelling comes from inside it] Hey!  It sounds like you guys are having a lot of fun, but it's really loud, and some of us are trying to work, so do you think you could do it a little more quietly?",pam
44923,"Okay, well it's just really loud.",pam
44927,You're back in.,pam
44928,"You know what?  Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition?  I'd love to see that dunk of yours.",jim
44930,"Today.  Now, maybe.  'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it.",jim
44932,Why not?,jim
44934,"Pass.  If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop.",dwight
44936,"Okay, a little about me.  I respond to strong leadership.",dwight
44937,"Alright, there you go.",jim
44939,"15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?",jim
44941,Okay.,jim
44953,Fantastic.,jim
44955,Yup.,jim
44957,[ambulance pulls away in parking lot] Now what?,jim
44960,"Oh my God, are you alright?  Erin, will you call 911 please?",jim
44962,Erin.,jim
44965,We could get Deangelo flowers.,pam
44966,"No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up.",dwight
44968,"All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons? [all but Dwight raise their hands]",jim
44969,"Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse? [Dwight raises his hand]",dwight
44970,Nope. Baskets have it.,jim
44971,"So as it turns out, unless you're a young child or a prison inmate, you don't need anyone supervising you. People just come in and do their work on their schedule. Imagine that - people like us allowed to sell paper. Unsupervised. [Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, and Oscar are working while Andy and Ryan play on a foosball table] And yet, somehow it works. It must be because the stakes are so high.",jim
44972,"[on phone] Well, I really appreciate the offer, but I'm just happy the way things are. Okay. Thank you. [to Pam] That was Jo, asking me if I wanted to take over as acting manager while they find a replacement. I told her... I don't want to mess this up, right? There's a consensus, people are happy.",jim
44973,"[on phone] Dwight Schrute. Yes, I would. Thank you. [hangs up] Jordan, gather my things from my desk. [Dwight walks to the manager's office, rubs the door frame, sits at the desk reverently]",dwight
44974,Wait...,jim
44975,What have you done?,pam
44976,Mose... you'll never guess where I am right now.,dwight
44978,Can't stay there all day.,pam
44979,I'm coming.,jim
44980,Do I at least get to go with you in this fantasy?,pam
44981,You'd slow me down.,jim
44982,"Dwight has been acting manager for three months now. No. A week. Just feels like three months. Let's see, we all have to punch in to a time clock, which is very old, very strong, and has a slot about the size of a finger. [Jim puts a pencil into the time clock and pulls it out broken in half] We were all given new business cards big enough to set us apart from the competition, which is how I learned that our titles are all now Junior Employee. Our lunch breaks are staggered to prevent wasting time. Mine's at 10:30, and I find that the first hour of the day goes by a lot quicker than the second seven hours.",jim
44983,Stop stalling! Come on.,pam
44988,"Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it. [Kevin looks exasperated] Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself.",dwight
44990,That's on a need-to-know basis.,dwight
44992,"[quietly] General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.",dwight
44993,"Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?",jim
44994,Define foment.,dwight
44995,You define foment.,jim
44996,[clears throat] Please take note of the new color-coding system.,dwight
44997,[surprising Kelly] Aha!,dwight
44999,Gotcha! Why are you late?,dwight
45001,"All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area. [Dwight points to her legs and slowly moves his finger up, stopping at her mid-section]",dwight
45002,"In fairness, Darryl did tell me that joke, so...",andy
45004,"I know, right?",andy
45006,Yeah?,andy
45008,Sure. What's going on? [in room with Gabe],andy
45010,What?,andy
45012,"No, this is horrifying.",andy
45014,"We're just friends, okay?",andy
45016,"Yeah, fine, I promise. We'll never date again. Can we go outside now?",andy
45018,"[seeing the Join the Fist flyers that Jim is hanging] Hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? What's this? What's the Fist?",dwight
45019,"Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know.",jim
45020,You expect me to believe that you're starting a rebellion?,dwight
45021,"Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion. [Darryl enters and brandishes his fist, Jim returns the gesture]",jim
45022,"Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist.",dwight
45023,"And we would love to have you. But not today. Unfortunately, it's a bad day, what with Operation Overthrow and everything, but I have noted it.  [Dwight tears the sign down, Jim hangs two signs in its place]",jim
45026,"Pam, I have to show you this video. You're gonna love it. It's Beyonce falling with a fart mixed in. [buzzer to indicate a blocked web site]",andy
45027,I will never be happier than I am right now. I will also never be less happy. I will be at my current maximum happiness for the rest of my life. Because I am manager of the Scranton Branch of Dunder Mifflin. Acting Manager.,dwight
45030,You mean the frozen mice for the piranha?,pam
45042,"Wow, you've really embraced the whole Bond villain aesthetic.",jim
45043,"Ah, Jim, Jim, Jim. The gun is a Beaumont-Adams. Jo collects them. I thought we could have some nice small talk about it. And the piranha's a rescue.",dwight
45044,And the desk.,jim
45045,"The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business.",dwight
45046,Okay.,jim
45047,Jo is coming later today. I cannot have a subordinate trying to make me look stupid. Okay? I need you to promise me that you'll be on your best behavior.,dwight
45048,"I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...",jim
45049,Don't make me fire you.,dwight
45050,You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers.,jim
45051,Don't make me pre-fire you.,dwight
45052,You wouldn't dare.,jim
45053,"Watch this. You're pre-fired. And when I'm promoted, you'll be full fired.",dwight
45054,"[quietly] If you get promoted, and if you haven't fallen in love with me by then.",jim
45055,What?,dwight
45056,"If I had thought that there was a real chance that Dwight would be permanent manager, I would have pre-quit. And you might be saying to yourself, 'Well that's pretty premature to think,' but I always say, it's better to be pre-pre-preprepared.",jim
45057,"How you doing, Jordan?",dwight
45059,"Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly.",dwight
45061,"Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou-[Dwight opens a box and sits down in shock] Ohh... it's a holster.",dwight
45062,"[walking around the office with the holster around his waist] Yep. Yep, yep, yep. Lookin' good. [grunts] Ohh... [stretching out his arms to better indicate the gun and holster] Oh, what a day. What a day.",dwight
45063,"Dwight, are you carrying a gun?",pam
45064,"The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me.",dwight
45065,"Dwight, guns make me really uncomfortable.",andy
45066,"The gun is just an accessory to the holster, okay? I can't walk around wearing an empty holster.",dwight
45067,Why do you need to wear the holster at all?,pam
45068,Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?,dwight
45071,Uh... hello! [indicates his phone clipped onto his belt],dwight
45073,Why would I put a banana in my holster?,dwight
45075,"Dwight, no gun, okay? Don't make us call Jo.",pam
45076,"Okay. All right. Fine. Everyone calm down. Someone get me a banana. Sorry I freaked you guys out - aah! [Dwight goes to flip the gun and it fires near Andy's ear, making everyone jump]",dwight
45078,Aah! Aah! It's so loud!,andy
45080,[trying to find a pitch] Eeeeeeee... There's like this crazy ringing going on. I can't - eeeeeee... I can't find perfect C.,andy
45084,"No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun.",dwight
45085,[scatting off-key] Something's definitely wrong.,andy
45090,"Okay, why are you calling Jo?",dwight
45091,I think I should go the hospital.,andy
45095,"Thank you, Darryl. [Andy limps out of his chair and leans on Darryl for support]",andy
45097,It's my ear.,andy
45099,"Okay, sorry.",andy
45102,"Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!",dwight
45103,"[enters with a cowboy hat, speaking with a Western accent] Yee-haw! Whoo-hoo! [imitates gunfire] Howdy, partners! It's me, Gun-Safety Dwight! And I'm the rootin'-est-- [removes hat] I can't do this. Um, look. Obviously, a gun went off under my watch, and I'm launching a full investigation.",dwight
45105,Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?,dwight
45107,I have no way of knowing if that's true.,dwight
45109,"Okay, really?",dwight
45112,Come on.,dwight
45114,"I just really, really think we should handle this internally.",dwight
45116,"Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best.",dwight
45117,Hey. [Erin gasps] We're back.,andy
45118,"There he is! Our hero! [Both Dwight and Erin move to hug Andy] You look fantastic. How you doing? Here, tell us your war stories.",dwight
45119,"Well, I burst my eardrum. Doctor said it could take weeks to heal.",andy
45120,Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal.,dwight
45121,Yeah.,andy
45123,Temporary deafness in one ear. It was both ears. I couldn't hear a thing Darryl was saying while we were in the waiting room.,andy
45126,American Idol? What? No.,dwight
45128,No.,dwight
45130,"Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition.",dwight
45134,I put everything back in the vending machine.,dwight
45136,You have to get rid of all your weapons. All of them. Including killer fish.,pam
45137,Okay.,dwight

45139,Thank God.,dwight
45140,"Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in 'Shagadelic, baby,' at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?",jim
45141,What's jazz hands?,dwight
45142,[quickly shakes his hands back and forth],jim
45143,Fine.,dwight
45144,[leaves the men's room with an empty fish tank after flushing the toilet],dwight
45147,"Hello, Jo. Welcome. Well, shall we begin?",dwight
45149,"Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?",jim
45151,"[does jazz hands, Jo notices and eyes him oddly] Well, what can you do? Life.",dwight
45152,We have to clean this up now!,andy
45157,No! [Erin and Andy laugh],andy
45159,Uh...,andy
45161,"Did I say that earlier? Yes, I did. Because you, Gabe, were crying...",andy
45163,And sobbing uncontrollably. Yes. Uh-huh. You were in hysterics. And my maternal instincts kicked in. Is it actually how I feel? Yes. Or no. That is... between me and my diary.,andy
45164,"Oscar, can you print out last year's sale statements?",dwight
45166,"No, Kevin, come on.",dwight
45168,"Kevin, not now.",dwight
45170,"Okay, okay. Shh! [Dwight begins rubbing his shoulders]",dwight
45172,"You're kidding me. [reaches under Kevin's jacket] Oh God, what am I touching? It's moist.",dwight
45174,"Oh, it's so wet.",dwight
45176,I can't. I can't push harder!,dwight
45178,"Okay, how's that?",dwight
45180,I'm kneading it!,dwight
45183,Jo... I accidentally fired a gun in the office today.,dwight
45185,"I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -",dwight
45187,"It was a Beaumont-Adams, if that helps.",dwight
45189,I take full responsibility.,dwight
45191,Pam made me put a banana in my holster.,dwight
45192,You shot a gun off -,pam
45193,Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes.,dwight
45195,Got it.,dwight
45197,"[on the verge of tears] Jo, please... I will -",dwight
45201,Yep.,jim
45205,"Hey, Dwight. What's up?",jim
45206,Shut up.,dwight
45207,"Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby. [Dwight sees Creed claiming the desk in the manager's office]",jim
45226,He never called a meeting.,jim
45228,What are we doing?,pam
45232,We need a new manager.,pam
45233,[conducting interview] Your paper experience is very interesting. Do you think you could use that experience to inform decisions here?,jim
45235,Really?,jim
45237,[waiting for Fred to continue] ...What is it?,jim
45244,You could just be saying it to get the job.,jim
45246,"How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.",jim
45248,Okay.,jim
45250,Did you just trademark that...,jim
45253,"We are the Search Committee, hand-picked by our CEO, and tasked to find this branch's new manager. Not everyone we meet will be good, but someone's bound to be, right? [Andy, Kelly, and Darryl are each dressed up in suits for their interviews, Andy is also wearing an 'Andy for Manager?' pin on his jacket] And, to be honest, I think a lot of the decent candidates are right here in-house, so, I'm not too worried. But I'm really excited to spend a lot of time with Toby and Gabe. [quietly] Did you know that Gabe's last name was Lewis? I had no idea.",jim
45261,[puts up a poster in the break room with 'IF YOU ARE ON THE SEARCH COMMITTEE PLEASE CONSIDER ANDY' on it in bold lettering],andy
45263,"The manager job? Nah, I'm barely interested. I just can't not go for it. You know, it's not the Bernard way. We give it the old college try, and then, in defeat, we show grace.",andy
45265,Don't even... [getting really happy and excited] EEEHHHH!!!!,andy
45267,EEEHHH!! No. Hehe.,andy
45268,"In my family, you don't really go out and get things. If you want something, you write it on a list, and then the housekeeper goes out and gets it, on Wednesdays and Fridays. So, I don't know, I guess you could say this job is on my list, and... [awkwardly smiling] we'll see what Rosa comes back with.",andy
45278,"[to Dwight, who is reading the want ads] Should you really be so blatant about that?",pam
45279,"They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.",dwight
45280,Are you really going to apply for work at Scranton Breadworks?,pam
45281,Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.,dwight
45283,"Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.",jim
45285,Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.,jim
45297,"Can you... [seems intimidated, clears throat] You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?",jim
45299,Yes.,jim
45301,Yes.,jim
45303,"[Robert leaves the conference room and looks at the others in the office as he grins at the camera and leaves] He creeps me out. [Toby nods] But, I think he might be a genius.",jim
45304,"[Jim points at Darryl to be the next interviewee] Good luck, Darryl.",andy
45307,"[Jim and Gabe laugh, Toby smiles and nods] Oh.",jim
45314,"Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?",jim
45317,"[ignoring Darryl's question] So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?",jim
45319,"Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that. [shows Darryl a resume] Cool? [goes to put the resume away]",jim
45327,What makes you feel qualified to judge a place after a mere interview? [Robert stares at Dwight] What are you doing..? [Dwight sits up abruptly] Stop trying to figure me out.,dwight
45329,You can't.,dwight
45331,"No, it's not.",dwight
45333,Stop trying to figure me out. [Robert turns to ignore Dwight] Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made?,dwight
45335,[standing up] Get out.,dwight
45336,"I'm gonna prevent inferior men from sullying my place of work with their weak, passionless leadership. Do you see my hat? No? That's because I just threw it in the ring.",dwight
45340,Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?,jim
45342,Is this a bad time to be doing this?,jim
45348,"[looking at an engagement ring on Angela's finger] It's gorgeous, Angela.",pam
45355,[laughing] Oh-ho-ho! He talked about himself in the third person?,pam
45357,That's not accurate.,pam
45360,Andy? You all set?,jim
45361,"Okay, guys, it's time. It's pep talk time. Tell me what I need to hear.",andy
45363,[grunts] Augh.,andy
45365,"So, Andy, what improvements would you make as office manager?",jim
45366,"For starters, I really think we can streamline communication around here... [gets cut off by Gabe]",andy
45368,"I wasn't acc-, accusing...",andy
45370,"Right! I really wasn't trying to insult any, anyone.",andy
45374,What?,andy
45376,Okay. Let me think... are you counting car windows?,andy
45378,"[happily] Uh, 93 million miles.",andy
45379,[to Gabe] Is it?,jim
45380,"Yeah! And the diameter of the Sun is 870,000 miles, which makes it 109 times wider than the Earth, and... [Gabe looks visibily annoyed] 333,000 times heavier than the Earth,...",andy
45382,"[alone in his car] I am unhappy with the confusing and, at times, confrontational nature of that meeting. I wanted it to go better. I WANTED IT TO GO BETTER!!",andy
45385,How is this on me?,pam
45386,Hang up. [Creed hangs up] Corporate needs you to find the differences between this picture and this picture. [shows Creed two similar-looking photos of some building] Intel has told us there were at least seven.,pam
45388,They're the same picture.,pam
45390,"Your department's just you, right?",jim
45398,"[comes in, slapping some papers on the table] I want an interview.",dwight
45399,[walking with Jim in the parking lot] How's the family?,dwight
45400,Good!,jim
45401,Good. They good?,dwight
45402,Yeah.,jim
45403,What's your daughter's name again? Peepee?,dwight
45404,Peepa.,jim
45405,"Peepa, how is she?",dwight
45406,Great.,jim
45407,"Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?",dwight
45408,No.,jim
45409,"Now, listen,...",dwight
45410,"You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.",jim
45411,"Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat [motions to grip Jim's throat] is the strong hand you want on the wheel.",dwight
45412,[pulls Dwight's arm down] Okay. That's vivid.,jim
45413,"I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam...",dwight
45414,Yikes.,jim
45415,Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.,dwight
45416,"Well, you know how I like taking bribes. [both smile]",jim
45417,Ha ha! [pats Jim on the back],dwight
45418,"Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?",jim
45419,"Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this.",dwight
45420,Okay.,jim
45421,Let me get that for you. [runs ahead to open the door for Jim],dwight
45422,Thank you.,jim
45423,Okay. [looks ashamed],dwight
45425,"The Senator? [Oscar nods] He was married before, and he has a kid.",pam
45427,And don't say that thing about how lots of gay guys have kids.,pam
45429,Did you see him at a bathhouse?,pam
45431,The windowless building by the Baskin Robbins.,pam
45433,Forget it. I'm never gonna know what goes on there.,pam
45435,You're in the gay mafia.,pam
45438,No.,pam
45452,Great.,jim
45454,I'm sure it's fine.,jim
45456,Howard Cline?,jim
45458,[checks sheet] Oh... Deshaun Williams.,jim
45460,He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...,jim
45462,Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys. [Darryl taps a couple times on Jim's desk and walks away],jim
45468,"That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?",jim
45474,I think that's probably all we need to hear from...,jim
45476,That's very...,jim
45481,You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.,jim
45483,"No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.",jim
45488,Uh--,jim
45490,"Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.",jim
45496,"No, was it good?",jim
45503,"[clears throat] Jo, may I speak to you for a second?",dwight
45505,"Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position.",dwight
45507,Okay.,dwight
45509,It's complicated.,dwight
45512,I'm a woman. I would want to know.,pam
45517,She does seem happy.,pam
45520,Okay.,pam
45527,"Uh, just put him through to me.",pam
45529,Hello! This is... the client.,pam
45531,Yes.,pam
45533,Great.,pam
45535,"Thank you, bye-bye.",pam
45541,"[seeing Dwight wearing sunglasses and whose face and hands are completely covered in gauze] Oh, I know this guy. [Dwight awkwardly hands copies of his resume to the Search Committee] Hello! Mr. 'Soo-ven-yay.' Mr. 'Jacques Soo-ven-yay.' Nice to meet you. It says here you're French. [Dwight nods] So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.",jim
45542,[mumbling through the gauze] Assistant Regional Manager.,dwight
45543,Assistant to the Regional Manager.,jim
45544,[again] Assistant Regional Manager.,dwight
45545,What is it?,jim
45546,[in a cheesy French accent] Assistant Regional Manager.,dwight
45547,"Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty.",jim
45549,Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo... [takes off sunglasses and reveals his face] It's me. I'm Dwight.,dwight
45550,"[looks extremely confused] No. No! Wait, but, I mean, you're Dwight, and then... he's the... [trails off]",jim
45551,[whispers] Yeah.,dwight
45552,[looks astonished] Ohhhh!,jim
45555,"I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!",dwight
45557,Yes.,dwight
45559,"This guy was good. Although, he did keep saying that he needed two weeks off right at the beginning for a trip to the finger lakes. Seriously. Every five minutes, he was like, 'just making sure the finger lakes thing is clear.'",jim
45561,Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.,jim
45571,Um... why Kelly?,jim
45573,Okay.,jim
45575,"Oh, I didn't know you knew her?",jim
45577,No.,jim
45579,"You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.",jim
45591,Silence?,dwight
45593,"Hey, Erin.",andy
45595,Where'd you learn how to puppet like that?,andy
45597,"Listen, I'm really flattered, but I don't think we should.",andy
45598,"Erin's my best friend in this office, hands down, but... when she asked me out, I just didn't have that feeling, you know? [clip jumps ahead] Aren't there some things that you really want to like, but you just can't... seem to like it, like, Mad Men... or football... [clips jumps ahead] Let's not forget, Erin chose Gabe over me. That happened. I'm not going to apologize for getting over her, okay? I'm sorry. [clip jumps ahead] I would go for someone who's more... she's great, though.",andy
45602,That was our dream wedding.,pam
45604,"[looks over at Oscar, who is quietly watching this happen] I hope... you have a very beautiful wedding, Angela.",pam
45606,All right. Name.,jim
45607,Dwight Schrute.,dwight
45608,"Thank you, Mr. Schnoot. [closes his binder] We will let you know.",jim
45609,You have to interview me...,dwight
45610,I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.,jim
45611,I demand more questions!,dwight
45612,"[ignoring Dwight] All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.",jim
45613,"Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it.",dwight
45614,Yes.,jim
45615,"What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and... [chuckles] getting everyone home on time. Dwight, let me be frank. In an accident that no one can blame you for, an antique gun was discharged while you were acting manager. How are we ever to trust you again? [whispering] That's a great question. [Jim nods] I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.",dwight
45616,"Thank you, Dwight.",jim
45617,"Thank you. [clears throat and gets up] You'll be hearing from us shortly, Mr. Schrute, and I think you're gonna like the call you're going to receive. [smiles] Oh, come on. I'm just happy that I got this meeting. [leaves]",dwight
45618,"Well, that was quick.",jim
45620,He's not a real candidate.,jim
45622,You took the deal.,jim
45624,That's not okay.,jim
45627,What is happening right now?,jim
45629,"No, why would you think that?",jim
45631,"Okay. [walks out of conference room] Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.",jim
45633,"No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.",jim
45634,"Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad.",dwight
45635,Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.,jim
45636,Tuna... You're completely sane.,andy
45637,Thank you.,jim
45638,"Who do you like for the job? Is there anyone who maybe was a little underwhelming at first, but now seems like a safe, if not slightly unexciting, choice?",andy
45639,"Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?",jim
45641,[while sighing] I suppose I am.,jim
45648,Yes.,jim
45650,Okay.,jim
45651,What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.,dwight
45654,"Whoever it is, I think they should be lame. [Stanley shakes his head and rolls his eyes] Kind a a non-threatening, moderate personality.",andy
45656,Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-,jim
45658,A homeless person. Really? A homeless person.,pam
45660,"No, I want you to say that you think the 'best' person to be our new manager is a homeless person.",pam
45664,Hey! Hey! Hey!,jim
45666,She may have a point there... would a small penis work? Small-to-moderate.,andy
45668,"Ohh, hey Gabe, I'm sorry, we... we didn't get you a cake or anything. We're gonna miss you.",pam
45677,"We're gonna miss you, Gabe. [Gabe leaves]",dwight
45678,"[stands up] Uh, listen up. Listen up, ladies. I want the job. There, I said it. I'm educated. I'm capable. I like all of you... and I won't make any changes.",andy
45682,"What about Darryl? We can all agree that he's a stand-up guy, right?",jim
45692,"What? No, no, it's not a vote.",jim
45694,I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.,jim
45696,"No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work. [exhales] We're going in this room, we're going to have a meeting. We're gonna make a recommendation to Jo, and she's gonna give you her recommendation on Monday. Okay? [to Kelly and Toby, as they re-enter the conference room] What the hell happened out there? [Kevin tries to follow, but the door is closed on him]",jim
45697,Sometimes you hear about people failing upwards. I think I'm about to do that.,andy
45704,"I will run this branch, or I will destroy this branch, or... [shrugs] I don't know. Something always works out. [leaves]",dwight
45706,"[in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Is that right?",pam
45708,"Well, okay!",pam
45710,[in a comedic male voice] Hello!,pam
45711,"[in high-pitched, damsel-like voice] Hello!",pam
45712,"Hi, how are ya? [Erin looks amused, Stanley and Phyllis look at Pam, confused]",pam
45713,"Ohho! I'm good! Don't you just love paper, and things about paper!",pam
45714,"Hey, are you single? This seems like a love connection to me!",pam
45719,[exiting elevator] After you my good sir.,andy
45720,"No, I insist.",dwight
45721,I insist.,andy
45722,"The Search Committee finally decided, after a lot of deliberation, on Robert California' for the manager position. Who took one look around and left.?? He drove down to Florida and convinced Joe to make him CEO... CEO... her own job. He talked her out of her own job. And I don't really know how someone does that. But, anyway, then the position was his to fill.'? And he chose'",jim
45723,"[drumroll with hands] I' it's unbelievable. True, I may have been the second choice, but I was the first-choice's first choice. And, about Dwight, I sensed that he might have some resentment about not getting the job so I sat him down and we had a talk. And I told him, 'I need a really strong number two. I want you to be my enforcer.' Smart, right?",andy
45725,"Uh, this has got to stop.",andy
45727,K... Kevin! [Kevin planking on Dwight's desk],dwight
45728,"Yeah, at first, I was really disappointed, but I've got a great daily routine going right now. I have upped my karate to eight times a week. I've added boxing - lunches and on weekends. I do kickboxing three times a week. Krav Maga four times a week. An hour of meditation every morning at sunrise and again at sunset. So yeah, I'm doin' great.",dwight
45729,"K, I'm gonna need some help. Pam?",dwight
45730,I don't think I should.,pam
45731,"Oh, yeah. Pregnant.",jim
45732,Right here. Little Michael Scott- [points to her belly],pam
45733,"No, I told you I don't like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.",jim
45734,Much different the second time around. And I have to say; it is nice not being the only pregnant woman in the office.,pam
45736,"Wait, when did we start calling it that-",pam
45738,"Well, I am a few months ahead of you.",pam
45740,"Hoist him aloft. C'mon Darryl. Lift, lift Darryl. [trying to lift Kevin off desk]",dwight
45745,No one should be planking at all.,jim
45746,"Thank you, yes. Dwight, my enforcer, my number two, can you take care of this?",andy
45747,Say no more.,dwight
45748,"[starts attacking plankers] Kids, don't try planking. It's dangerous. [knocks Toby off table] 'Specially with me around.",dwight
45749,"You watching that commercial again? [Pam nods] Why do you keep watching it, if you know it's just gonna make you cry?",jim
45750,"Because everything makes me cry, so what's the difference? This dog, he just wants to protect his bone.",pam
45751,He's got a bank vault. That's a start.,jim
45752,Not enough though.,pam
45753,"The new CEO works out of the conference room about half the time. But whenever he takes a break, he does these weird walks around the office. And you never know who he's gonna zero in on for these really intense small-talks. You just hope it's not you. And yet, you hope it is you too. It's strange.",jim
45761,"Hey, Robert. We have that 9:30am casual chit-chat scheduled. I emailed you about it last night to confirm. And again this morning.",andy

45765,[motions he is on the phone] Can I call you right back? Thank you very much. [comes over] Okay. [sees notebook with two lists of staff names] What is this?,jim
45766,The Friday before Columbus Day. Thoughts?,andy
45768,"Just making chit-chat. Kind of a medium year for women's soccer, no?",andy
45769,What are you looking at?,dwight

45771,It can't be nothing.,dwight

45777,"No. Okay. Um, I'll take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?",jim

45794,Really great list of names guys. Thank you so much. Good work.,andy
45795,"Uh, no, actually. That was in Robert's notebook.",jim
45796,He left it at reception and we photocopied it.,pam
45797,"Oh, okay. I don't want any part of this.",andy
45798,Maybe it's a list of people he's gonna fire.,pam
45799,"Okay, it's not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.",jim
45800,This is if we were all on a cruise ship and had to divide into lifeboats. This is if we were on a cruise ship and had to divide into life rafts. Here's something. Who would eat who in an 'Alive' situation. No... that can't be it.,dwight

45810,I'm already working on this Columbus Day thing for you guys and it's starting to stack up. Feels like a lot. One thing at a time.,andy
45813,"What's up? Weird thing. Totally awkward, but you left your notebook on the reception desk.",andy
45815,And it was open. And people saw this. And they're just kinda going nuts and like wondering what it is.,andy

45821,What?,andy
45823,"That is fascinating. And, by the way, I am so glad I asked. People were just sort of- Did you just move my name?",andy
45825,"Okay. Robert's in the annex, everybody think quick. What do these groups have in common?",andy

45832,"Thank you. A little much needed comic relief, but we really need to figure this out guys.",andy
45835,"No, it's not. Here's how we find out. Let's line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other.

45863,Great group! Pizza party!,andy
45865,"Well, why don't you ask me again when the five pizzas get here.",andy
45867,Okay. You guys ever had Margarita pizza?,andy

45879,C'mon.,dwight
45881,"C'mon, c'mon.",dwight
45883,C'mon.,dwight
45885,"Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!",dwight

45888,"[Pam's phone vibrates] Oh, text from Jim. 'This is getting very weird. Will explain later.'",pam
45889,"[Everyone's phone vibrates] Oh, text from Kevin.",pam
45892,"I used to be young and cute and sorta funny and I could do those cute, little cartoons. And everyone who came through here was like, 'Who's that receptionist? I like her.' Now I'm just a fat mom. Yeah, and you take one look at me and you're like, 'Oh, loser.'",pam
45893,"C'mon Pam. Chins up, okay? Bad joke. Look around this room. Does this look like a group of losers? Seriously?",andy
45894,Oh. Oh God.,pam

45901,"Well, that was certainly an odd lunch. Is everything alright?",jim
45902,"Yeah, I'm fine.",pam
45905,"When I was a salesman I could just be like 'Not my job, not my prob. I'm going to the warehouse to polish my knob.' Metaphorically, of course. But now, it is my job and my prob.",andy
45906,"Hi, Robert? Can you come out here please it's really important. Just wanted to clarify something. Some people here are under the misconception that some people may be considered, uh, let's say top-tier and others would be second-tier.",andy
45908,"Thank you. Great.
Robert. I said winners and losers. Is that what you're talking about?",andy
45909,"Oh, that, it might- That might actually be what I'm thinking of. Can you clarify that?",andy
45912,"No. No, no.",andy
45914,I'm going in there.,andy
45915,"I know that every time I talk to you things just seem to get worse. But, you don't know these people and I do. And if I let you work with faulty information, well, then I'm not doing my job as regional manager. So, please take this pen and change your list.",andy
45917,"Well, then I will make a new list for you. Stanley... you may think he's a lazy grump, but did you know that he has the most consistently high sales numbers of anyone in this office? And you may think he's hard to love, but did you know that he's in, not one, but two long-term romantic relationships?",andy
45919,"Meredith Palmer... Supplier relations. The word 'no' not even in her vocabulary. And just to show you that I'm being fair. You had Gabe in the loser column. I think that is astute. Good call. Pam, easily the most creative and kind person I have ever worked with.",andy
45920,"Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.",dwight
45921,Shhh.,jim
45922,"Erin Hannon, the receptionist and my closest confidant. A winner if there ever was one.",andy

45941,"Okay, I know I've been crying easily today, but- [shows unfolded paper Jim dropped, shows two lists, 'Pam' and 'Cece' on one side, 'Everything else' on the other] I mean, that's just pretty killer, right? I mean, maybe it's stupid. No. [starts crying] It's wonderful. I'm gonna frame it. I can always unframe it.",pam
45942,"I gotta say, I think it's kinda cool not knowing. It's like one of those movies that ends on a note of mystery. Did the butler do it? Are they ghosts? You know? It's kinda sophisticated.",andy
45944,"[weepy] Yeah, I hate those endings.",pam
45952,"[grunting, trying with Jim to lift Kevin planking on his desk] Man, it's like hoisting a manatee. I can't get a grip it's so vast.",dwight
45953,Ryan? A little help?,jim
45954,God. How do whalers do it?,dwight
45956,"Creed! Wha- [Shoves Creed with his foot, Creed grunts] This is a safety issue with you. There's no way to know if you're dead!",andy

45979,"I insist. It is gonna be our treat, please?",dwight
45982,"Oh, tips are expected?",dwight
45984,"Then expect to be shocked. Jim, you owe me $14.75. Oscar, $14.75. Darryl....",dwight
45987,Whoo! Yeah! Yeah!,dwight
45988,"Come on, man.",jim
45989,Winners!,dwight

46003,No he hasn't.,pam
46008,"Kevin, I appreciate what you're trying to do.",andy
46010,"Here, we have a word code, the same way we have a dress code.  And what we're talking about is'basically the speech equivalent' to just wearing underpants.  Sometimes words, you no need use'but need need for talk talk.",andy
46012,Does it save time though? 'Cause we've been here for about an hour.,jim
46014,"Kevin, at most you're saving a microscopic amount of time.",pam
46016,What are you gonna do with all this time?,andy
46018,"Kevin, you cannot possibly save enough time to see the world.",pam
46019,"K, Kevin, are you saying 'See the world'? or 'Sea World?'",jim
46021,"No, see? Right there, that's the problem with your method. 'Cause I still don't know if you're saying 'Sea World' or 'see the world,' and it's taking a lot of time to explain it.",jim
46024,This week we are rolling out the brand new Sabre tablet'.the Pyramid.  [holds up triangle shaped touch pad],dwight
46026,"So, you can tell your clients: 'Unleash the power of the pyramid.'",dwight

46112,OF course not.  There's no magic button.  You have to summon that.,andy

46115,"Dwight, anything?",andy
46116,"We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it they're out of the house.",dwight
46117,"You know what? We need to get our heads out of the box.  If we did have something, what would it look like, what would it be? [Jim raises hand] Tuna.",andy

46162,This is what's under the blanket.,andy
46164,"These are incentives.  It's how we're gonna double growth. Now, you're probably all asking yourselves: 'Well, how does this work?'",andy
46165,"Seems like a basic reward system where you give us points, and then we redeem those points for prizes.",pam

46167,Oh. [smiling],pam
46169,Twenty points.,andy

46208,Hundred and twenty points.,andy

46362,"I know what you'd do with all that money. [imitating Jim] 'Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug.'",dwight
46363,"No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.",jim
46364,"And then on the weekends, would you hacky sack back to reality and spend time with your wife and kids?",pam
46365,Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine?,jim
46366,I think we should get a townhouse in SoHo...,pam
46368,"And then every morning, I'd walk out on to my terrace and I would breathe in the inspiration of the city. You know? And just gather ideas for my painting...",pam
46370,And then my handsome husband...,pam
46371,Which ideally would be me....,jim
46372,Would bring me a flavored coffee.,pam

46380,"What d-? What..what? Wuh, do we have new guys, or what?",andy
46382,Are they on their way over?,andy
46386,This is kinda time sensitive.,andy

46418,That is not Darryl. I don't know where Darryl is. I suspect probably our Darryl is inside of fat Darryl.,andy
46419,"OK. Three hundred boxes of twenty pound white. That's seventy-five boxes per person, so that's not so bad.",jim
46420,"Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it! [climbs into forklift]",dwight
46421,Nice. [Dwight runs forklift into wall of warehouse] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!,jim
46423,Yup.,dwight
46424,"Welcome, everybody! My name is Andy and this is my other brother Darryl.[no one laughs] What? No Newhart fans? OK...Darryl, how do we usually kick these things off?",andy
46427,"Does anyone have experience? Shelving, storing, keeping track. What do we use, the Dewey Decimal system?",andy
46430,Well-,andy
46432,"Um, can you guys give us a minute? But stay close, you're all doing great. [group begins leaving] maybe grab a coffee..or if there's any donuts out you can split one. You know they're for everybody so people get fussy....You know what? Just have a donut. [shuts door and sits, gesturing for Darryl to sit next to him. Then gets up to stand near Darryl.] Do you wanna talk about this not winning the lottery thing?",andy
46434,"You sure? Cause you keep talking about it, so...",andy
46436,"Good. Great. Then can you say things that aren't like a huge bummer to everybody? Cause the more I talk, the more they're gonna realize I don't know what I'm talking about.",andy
46438,"We need you, OK?",andy
46440,OK?,andy
46442,Alright.,andy
46443,[Grunts while lifting box into truck] What's the problem? Grunting is scientifically proven to add more power. Ask any female tennis player. Or her husband. [Erin grunts loudly and tosses box toward truck but misses],dwight

46455,No.,pam
46457,"Uh, buying lottery tickets online. [Ryan laughs]",pam
46459,"You came in at 10:30 today, right?",pam
46461,Is everyone licensed?,andy
46463,"No. Warehouse license....Masters in warehouse sciences?...I, I feel like Darryl has talked about a license of some kind.",andy
46465,"No. Not joking. This is real....painfully real, what is happening right now.",andy
46467,There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.,jim
46468,"Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday.",dwight
46469,Yeah [laughs and then notices camera] Not that they're not smart people.,jim
46470,"[Noticing camera] No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.",dwight
46471,I'd go with that.,jim
46472,Like baboons or elephants.,dwight
46473,"Not that, don't...",jim
46475,"It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just-",jim
46477,Kevin! Doesn't apply.,dwight
46480,Does anyone get distracted easily by bubble wrap? [raises hand and laughs] You'll be dealing with lots of bubble wrap obviously. Um...,andy
46483,No. Because they all left.,andy
46485,"I mean, after you bailed? I got confused and frankly a little weird and the stuff that you said certainly didn't help.",andy
46487,What are you talking about? I'm not gonna fire you.,andy
46489,"'..OK, this is weird. I don't, I don't get the joke.",andy
46491,"So Darryl says to me 'fire me'. But what he really means is 'I'm gonna say something really weird, try and figure out what it means.' So I say 'No, you're not fired.' But what I really mean is 'I have no idea what your talking about, but I'm gonna go ahead and hire some people for the warehouse and hope that you eventually start feeling better.'........I really hope that's what he and I mean.",andy
46492,"Attention! Does anyone know anyone who could work in the warehouse? We can pay. Come on Oscar, who's the most jacked guy in all of Scranton? Like your wildest fantasy guy.",andy
46494,Definition.,andy
46496,Are those just show muscles? Or is he really strong?,andy
46499,"So. I've been thinking, after we win the lottery, we take our winnings....",pam
46500,Our fake winnings,jim
46501,"And we move to the south of France. See? No, there's plenty of bicycling for you. I think that's where they do the Tour de France.",pam
46502,"It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it.",jim
46503,"Because I'm never gonna act like that, even in your fantasy.",pam
46504,"Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now. [Pam sighs]",jim
46505,"Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again?",dwight
46506,A...hot chocolate tea,jim

46509,"Great....Well, it'll bring a fresh new perspective to the warehouse.",andy
46511,"Eh, cool. We'll figure that out.",andy
46513,Got it. Dually noted. You! [points to Bruce] Coolest tank top I have ever seen. Where did you get that?,andy
46515,So cool! What a cross-section we have here. That's what I love about interviewing. I get to meet all these people I wouldn't ordinarily meet or know or even talk to.,andy

46517,Kevin Costner.,jim
46518,Kevin Costner.,dwight
46519,Yeah. [Shot shows Kevin and Erin greasing floor of warehouse],jim
46522,"So, it's not the dumbest idea.",jim
46523,It's not the greatest one either...,dwight
46524,"But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.",jim
46525,And it's clear we're not going to carry them. [Dwight grunts loudly in shot showing them sliding boxes over the greased floor],dwight
46526,"So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.",jim

46529,Is he OK?,jim
46530,Yep. He'll be fine.,dwight
46531,Surprise! Your new crew.,andy
46533,Why? Because you didn't win the lottery? How am I supposed to make you happy?,andy
46535,Yeah.,andy
46537,"Haha, what?",andy
46539,"I'm not gonna give you my job! It's my job! I earned it! And here's the thing, you weren't even next in line. I asked about you, I saw your file. You have a history of being short with people and you hired Glenn, your buddy! To replace you in the warehouse. He was under qualified. They saw that.",andy
46541,"Nate! Please....thank you. You have no business education, you were gonna take classes under D'Angelo, what happened to that?",andy
46543,"He didn't die, his brain died. And my brain is still very much alive and I'd be happy to give you business classes. How come you haven't asked me about it?",andy
46545,"None, no part of this has anything to do with you.",andy
46547,"Oh, but you had time for a softball clinic, and a Mediterranean cooking class.",andy
46549,Hey. Here's the thing. Jo saw something in you. She loved you! She gave you a shot and then you stopped pushing. She noticed. [long pause],andy
46551,OK what?,andy

46564,"OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.",dwight
46567,"OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.",jim
46570,I don't know.,dwight
46572,That's alright.,jim
46574,"Doesn't matter what the name is. Se??or Loadenstein, that's stupid.",jim

46579,Porque es muy rapido.,jim

46582,"It's uh, it's in beta testing.",dwight
46584,"Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping.",dwight
46589,We came to an agreement. We're going to live in a stunning pre-war brownstone at the top of a mountain.,pam
46590,Right. It's city and country combined.,jim
46591,Just a subway stop away are the best museums in the world.,pam
46592,And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.,jim

46595,Oh..,pam
46596,But what are you gonna do about that?,jim
46597,What are you gonna do?,pam
46601,"Ok, ok. We are so close. All we have to do is figure out that corner and we're basically there.",jim
46602,"I know. Kevin, we've been friends for a long time, right?",dwight
46604,So if I was to ask you to sacrifice your body and lay down on a greasy corner and act as a human bumper shield-,dwight
46605,"Ok, Dwight! Come on. Here, I think I have an idea.",jim
46606,"I wouldn't be asking you lightly, now would I?",dwight
46608,"Right. Now do you wanna wear a trash bag, er...",dwight
46609,Dammit Dwight!,jim
46611,"Ok, I have a question. Why is the truck so far away?",jim
46614,"Ok, I just asked that ques-, I don't know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.",jim
46615,"Yeah, why is it so far away Jim?",dwight
46616,So this warehouse has been around for what? Like a thousand years? And they never thought to back the truck up into it? I guess sometimes it just takes a fresh set of eyes. Alright! [knocks on side of truck],jim
46620,Whoa whoa whoa!,jim
46624,"No! Stop! Stop stop stop stop! You're way over! Ok, you gotta cut it! Cut it hard! (bleep!) Stop stop stop stop! Stop, stop! Dammit Dwight. Great.",jim

46638,"Oh, god. I need you to call the billboard company.",andy
46640,Which one did you see?,andy

46914,There you go. Thank you.,andy
46918,I don't know if I can.,jim
46921,Alright.,jim
46922,"I know, I know, I know. But Darryl and Kevin needed a third. They bought me this jersey. I said no. Kevin started crying. So, I am Chris Bosh.",jim
46925,It's called a costume.,dwight
46927,"Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?",dwight
46929,"Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It's all Toby's fault.",dwight
46931,"Everybody looking good, this is, this is the best we can do? I'm not judging, I, I think you guys look great, I just... wanna make sure this is the best we can do?",andy
46932,I just got a text from Broccoli Rob - 'Boo!' Scared me. And then I got this text from Robert California - 'Looking forward to Halloween party. Expectations are high.' Scared the s**t out of me.,andy
46933,"G'day, Pameroo. Could you shoot this off for me?",andy
46934,Yeah.,pam
46935,Australian accent...,andy
46936,"[faxing, Erin watching over her shoulder] What are you doing?",pam

46940,"Oh, Erin...",pam
46942,"Um, 2?",pam
46944,"No, I mean, you're doing great, and Andy put you in charge of the whole party, right?",pam
46946,Yeah.,pam
46950,"Oh, hey, if you go by the Banshee Pub, tell the Man In Black I say hello.",pam
46952,"Okay. When I was 22, I worked there and everybody said the place was haunted. I didn't believe it until one day before we opened, I look up into the mirror, you know, behind the bar, and I see this old man dressed all in black, but when I turn around, there's no one there. So, I tell the cook my story...",pam
46954,"...and he said, That's what everyone sees, that's the Man In Black.",pam
46955,No! My wife does not believe in ghosts.,jim
46956,Hey.,jim
46957,Hey!,pam
46958,"Oh, this Man In Black thing, what do you think that was about?",jim
46959,What do you mean?,pam
46960,"Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?",jim
46961,I saw a ghost.,pam
46962,"Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?",jim
46963,"It was a ghost, I told you this on, like, our first date.",pam
46964,"Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it.",jim
46965,"I don't know what to tell you, Jim, but I saw a ghost.",pam
46966,"Hey! Uh-oh, looks like we're under a Jack attack!",andy
46968,Yes.,andy
46976,"Wow, who shot our grown-up party with a kiddie raygun? We're still getting it set up, it's gonna be really cool.",andy
47006,"Yeah, perfectly mediocre.",dwight
47008,"I'm a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul.",dwight
47010,Damnit. I AM Kerrigan from Starcraft! I've been censored.,dwight
47012,Kerrigan is ruler of the Zerg swarm!,dwight
47014,"Yeah, but no nipples.",dwight
47016,Hey. What's up?,andy
47018,Yeah...,andy
47020,"Um, I just thought you could use some help, you know, because Robert came in and thought the party seemed a little kiddie, and I guess I agreed, and maybe we could mix a little more 13 into the PG.",andy
47022,"Can we talk about it at the end of the day? I gotta call, gotta make a call.",andy
47024,[pretending to be on the phone] Yes. [laughs] I don't know. Mmhmm.,andy
47037,[answers phone] Pam Halpert.,pam
47038,Hey it's Jim Halpert.  I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight.  Because I've read a lot about this really great documentary.,jim
47039,Is it called Ghostbusters?,pam
47040,[laughs] It's called Ghostbusters.,jim
47041,It didn't look like that.,pam
47042,It didn't have a buster sign around him?  Why don't you draw him?  Why don't we see this whole thing.,jim
47043,Ok fine I'll draw him. [hangs up phone and draws],pam
47044,I ain't fraid of no ghost. [Pam holds up drawing of a hand with the middle finger raised] Whoa!,jim
47045,Mmhmm.  Dwight are you eating a stick?,pam
47046,It's a root you idiot.,dwight
47048,That's really rude.  I don't tell you hurricanes suck even though it's true.,dwight
47050,Try influenza.,dwight
47052,Open up a newspaper.  Oh look a hurricane's coming.  I suppose you're going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?,dwight
47054,You know that's',jim
47056,I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.,jim
47065,Party looks fun doesn't it?  Everybody seems to be in there having a great time.  So maybe now would be a great time for me to pop back on the computer.,jim
47067,[to Dwight] Are you serious?,jim
47068,Yeah I'm serious.,dwight
47069,That's funny.  Ok.,jim
47070,Loser.,dwight
47078,It really looks great.  You did a great job.,andy
47080,We should still have that talk.  Maybe you can come by my office at like 4:45? [Erin nods] Cool.,andy
47084,What's the story?,andy
47088,I think we've seen enough.  You can turn it off now.  [everyone murmurs agreement] Yeah turn it off now.,andy
47091,That was awful.  Robert I apologize.,andy
47093,What we have here is a classic misunderstanding.,andy
47097,Did you think I was going to fire you?  No I wasn't.  [to Robert] I'm sorry this must be really uncomfortable for you.,andy
47099,Ok.  Erin I think you know I've been dating someone.,andy
47101,And it's getting a little more serious.  She's never come by.,andy
47103,No I didn't want her to call because I thought it would be weird.  But now it's weird that she's not calling.,andy
47105,Thirty-one.,andy
47109,[whispering] Thank you.,jim
47110,Jim doesn't let me wash his NFL jersey during the playoffs. How is this any less logical?,pam
47111,"Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win.",jim
47112,Really.,pam
47113,No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not...,jim
47115,Thank you.,jim
47116,"Go, get up there right now.",dwight
47119,"You wanna attack or let them come to us? Your call, B.",dwight
47122,[laughs] Nice.,dwight
47124,Got 'em. Go!,dwight
47137,"Like, a few years down the road, Cece says, 'Mom, there's a ghost in my closet.' Now, you say one of two things - one, 'You're just having a bad dream,' or two, 'Let's go see what it was.'",jim
47138,"I'm not gonna freak her out, Jim.",pam
47139,Ok.,jim
47140,"I'm not gonna lie to her, either.",pam
47141,"Oh, come on!",jim
47159,Pink is the red-,jim
47161,"I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate. Meredith said she believes in them too.",jim
47172,"I'm a Jamaican zombie woman. Leave me alone, ghoul.",dwight
47174,"Uh, I know what it is. Ok? I have like a thousand people over every week to watch it. Ok? We all kinda hate it though.",dwight
47176,The city of Atlanta.,dwight
47178,Thank you.,pam
47180,"Oscar, how are you on that side?",jim
47181,This isn't about sides. This is about me seeing a blueish gray old man in the mirror and then he vanishes.,pam
47183,"No, Creed.",pam
47184,But that would make more sense. [Pam sighs],jim
47185,[Flickering Lights] Hey everybody it's closing time. You don't got to go home but you can't stay here. [Plays radio and the song is Closing Time by Semisonic],andy
47187,Closing time.,andy
47188,"Every office needs an end of the day tradition. Something to tell you the day is over.  Otherwise, you go home and the night just feels like more day.  It's weird.",andy
47189,Closing time,andy
47190,[On phone] ...W R K.,jim
47191,One last call for alcohol so finish your whiskey and beer.,andy
47192,"Uh no it's W R K, as in kitten.  Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that's what you are hearing.",jim
47193,Come on pam!,andy
47195,Let's see. Andy has been manager for a hundred and five days. Which means I've heard 'Closing Time' a hundred and five times. [nods and shakes head] Still don't know the words. Tah wa Ta way hm hm home and home and home.,pam
47196,"I know who I want to take me home. I know who I want to take me home. [Pulls towel through legs] I know who I want to take me home. [Spins Meredith in chair] Take me hooo'hooome! You know what fine! I try to start fun traditions for you guys, but if you don't want to sing' no traditions!",andy
47201,Whose your favorite iron chef?,andy
47203,You go first.,andy
47205,Well the monitoring software is a double edged sword. Sometimes',andy
47206,"[runs in and interrupts] Sorry, go ahead.",dwight
47208,Wha'Yes. Your attention. Uh because' No that is all. [walks out],dwight
47209,"Last night I dreamed that the number two was the most valued number in the world. The vice president had all the power. Athletes fought for silver medals. Women were considered the best gender. And stadiums of fans shouted 'We're number two!'. As with all my dreams, I'm guessing it was about my fear of immigrants.",dwight
47211,Umpf'that's not good. Chalk that one up to Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb out there.,andy
47213,"They're both Kevin. Oscar is the Sex and the City gang and Angela, if you can picture'",andy
47215,I would agree with that.,andy
47217,"End the mistakes, easy-",andy
47219,I would like that.,andy
47221,"I'm just saying with the NBA lockout I think roller derby's in a really good place now. So'my pitch is'me, Pam, you and, someone else maybe Justine.",jim
47223,Is that off again?,jim
47225,Ok.,jim
47234,"I may have a little solution to our mistakes problem. This is a project I've been working on for quite some time and today, might be the day to use it.",dwight
47235,What do you got?,andy
47236,"[opens folder] Allow me. You're going to love this. [struggles opening folder] Ugh'should've used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work.",dwight
47237,Sounds controversial.,andy
47238,Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?,dwight
47239,Do not go there! You're the deuce I never want to drop.,andy
47240,"Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.",dwight
47241,Go do the voodoo that you do so well.,andy
47242,I will do my voodoo.,dwight
47243,Mmhmmm.,andy
47260,"Hi guys. I just wanted to say that, you all have been doing amazing work., really.",andy
47262,"And I'd like to add that your work has been a little sloppy. So, Dwight and I have implemented a new program that we like to call'Dwight'",andy
47263,The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you're out.,dwight
47264,"If we as a group make five mistakes in a day, something bad happens like we block Minesweeper.",andy
47265,Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.,dwight
47267,"Robert's favorite songs: Creep by TLC, Creep by Radio Head. You remember that one Jim? There is no way he hasn't strangled at least one stripper. Oscar. He eats his yogurt like he is punishing it for disappointing him. Kelly.",dwight
47269,P.S. We should should kill him.,dwight
47270,"Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?",jim
47271,"No, it's an accountability booster.",dwight
47272,Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.,jim
47273,"Jim, you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task.",dwight
47276,[Everyone angrily disagreeing]Smile'nod. Smile and nod.,dwight
47277,"They are making me out to be a Bond villian. I like to think of myself as a brilliant scientist who will stop at nothing to remake the world. Like'not Doctor Moreau someone good. Doctor Frankenstein, Doctor Jekyll, not them. Doctor'",dwight
47278,"Are you sure this is a good idea? I mean the thing about this office is, we make a lot of mistakes.",andy
47279,"But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve.",dwight
47280,"Alright everybody, looks like we need to be getting to work. Be extra careful. Double check everything or the accountability booster will getcha.",andy
47283,"[alert goes off] Oh, there's one mistake.",dwight
47285,Dwight's our co-worker and he worked really hard on this doomsday device so I',andy
47286,"It's not a doomsday device, gosh. [Erin makes red strike on desk] We can do this you guys.",dwight
47307,"Alright everybody, you are doing great!",andy
47308,"Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work. [Meredith gives dwight the finger]",dwight
47309,"Dwight, question.",jim
47310,No questions.,dwight
47311,If this doomsday device goes off...,jim
47312,Accountability booster.,dwight
47313,If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?,jim
47314,I haven't even considered it. That's how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.,dwight
47317,Ok.,jim
47318,How about Scrantonstrangler666.,dwight
47319,Nope.,jim
47320,"No. Oh shoot. Ha ha ha'You guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won't even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike.",dwight
47322,Hmm'Heda. [alert] No.,jim
47340,Gahhh. That's five strikes.,andy
47342,Dwight we got five strikes.,andy
47343,Really?,dwight
47344,Did the email go out or',andy
47345,It goes out automatically at five P.M.,dwight
47346,"Well, th- There's gotta be a way to stop it.",andy
47347,"Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it.",dwight
47348,Ok! Dwight you may now enter your password.,andy
47349,No.,dwight
47350,What?!,andy
47351,You don't deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day.,dwight
47353,"No you didn't, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine. [everyone interjects] What?!",dwight
47355,"Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?",dwight
47357,"Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please.",dwight
47358,Nn no.,andy
47359,What?,dwight
47360,No!,andy
47363,Good luck finding a new job idiots. I'll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.,dwight
47365,I bet he went home.,pam
47366,Some of us should go there and talk some sense into him. Get him to stop that email.,andy
47367,"Pam, you should come with me. Dwight really likes you and your breasts are enormous that could help us.",andy
47369,Kevin has that lovability.,andy
47371,"Jim, I want you to go find Robert just be where he is in case that email goes out at five. You can try to delete it or something.",andy
47372,"Ok, where is he?",jim
47374,I'll try both.,jim
47375,[digging] Oh. Come to reason with me?,dwight
47376,"Gotcha something. [gives Dwight cap, Dwight throws it aside] And, uh, I just really want to talk to you-",andy
47377,Get lost.,dwight
47378,"Well now hold on it, it-",andy
47379,What are you doing?,pam
47380,What does it look like I'm doing? Digging a grave for a horse.,dwight
47381,Uhm.,pam
47383,"Yeah, do you need a hand? [everyone joins in]",pam
47384,"If you hit another horse, you've dug to far.",dwight
47386,Robert.,jim
47388,"Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.",jim
47390,You up for a game?,jim
47392,Exactly. Here we go. Let's do it.,jim
47393,"Are you okay, Kevin? [Kevin gives thumbs down]",pam
47394,[to Dwight] Where you going?,andy

47396,"Uh, could we come in too? Just for some water.",pam
47397,"Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on.",dwight
47398,"Oh, wow. I forgot how pretty your house is.",pam

47414,In the box. [hits it straight into the floor],jim
47421,"Oh, haha. Oh well. Pobody's nerfect, right?",pam
47422,"Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It's 'Nobody's perfect.' Nice stroke, Pam.",dwight
47423,"No. It's a jokey saying. Pobody's nerfect, like I can't even say those words right. Ha.",pam
47424,"I hadn't heard that before, that's, that's funny.",dwight

47426,You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie? Milk.,pam
47427,Any specific animal?,dwight

47461,[her text tones rings] Dwight stopped the device!,pam
47462,Oh!,andy
47467,"They're not my favorite people in the world. I wouldn't even call them friends. They come over here, eat my pie, dig the crappiest horse grave you've ever seen. [pulls cap he previously discarded, out of the dirt] God, I'm gonna have to work with them forever, aren't I?",dwight
47469,"[hits ball, ricochets to groin] Ah! Classic, right? [Jim continues to rally poorly and falls down]",jim

47477,Yeah. That does not feel good.,jim
47479,Let's not make any mistakes today. Or at least no more than four.,andy
47482,This could be real. Dwight's pretty handy with computers. He fixed my laptop once.,pam
47483,"Ok, he didn't fix it. The brightness level was all the way down.",jim
47484,You couldn't fix it.,pam
47485,I wasn't here that day.,jim
47486,Yes you were.,pam
47487,"No- Ok. Well, we'll talk about it later. Straussburg! I had a meeting in Straussburg and I dropped you off beforehand. I was wearing a tan shirt with stripes?",jim
47488,"I don't think so, babe.",pam
47489,"Ok, this is crazy.",jim
47490,"I have never played squash. But I have seen it in countless 80's movies and it seems like the most common mistake is that you serve too hard and hit yourself right in the squash balls. So, as long as I don't do that, I think I'll be alright.",jim
47492,[grunts] Good game. You are a worthy opponent. You wanna play one more?,jim
47494,No? Come on.,jim
47496,"Well, that is... because you didn't realize that... I was left-handed.",jim

47502,Yes. Of course. [whispers] Erin..[throws pipes at Erin],andy
47503,"Hey, Andy.",dwight
47504,Yeah?,andy
47505,"Maybe I could sit in on this one with you? You know, that way I can cover you in case you need to urinate or you just want another opinion, or defecate...",dwight
47506,I don't think so.,andy
47507,Well I just thought with my new increased responsibilities and all...,dwight
47508,"Yeah. I'm still figuring out the two man bobsled here, so let's hold off on the D-man for now.",andy
47509,Erin.,andy
47511,In two minutes I want you to come into this meeting and tell me I have a really important phone call. I'm not going to take it because I want him to know how important the meeting is to me.,andy
47513,Nobody. Just say that I'm-  Just make it up that I have a phone call. And then I'm going to refuse to take it.,andy
47515,Just make up a phone call. It's not a real call. Make it up.,andy
47517,And come and tell me. Doesn't matter what it is.,andy
47519,I'm not going to take it. And then he's going to be like 'whoa this is a really important meeting'.,andy
47521,Okay.,andy
47522,"Ok, so tell me exactly what kind of deal you are getting now and I'll tell you how we can beat it.",andy
47525,Yeah.,andy
47527,I'm sorry ' I'm with a very important client. It'll have to wait.,andy
47529,There is nothing more important to me right now than this meeting.,andy
47532,I don't think she's dead.,andy
47534,She's not dead. This is exactly the kind of thing my mom pulls.,andy
47536,Andy I'm really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.,dwight

47562,Oh we know.,dwight
47563,I'm training a temp to be my replacement while I'm on maternity leave. Oh I should've mentioned I'm pregnant. You probably didn't notice because it's impossible to tell I'm so small. But yeah I'm pregnant. [another squeak] Oh come on!,pam
47565,Hmm. Doubt it.,jim
47567,You doubt it?,pam
47568,What's that?,jim
47569,Why do you doubt that she's single?,pam
47570,Honestly I have no idea. I just figured we'd save her from Ryan right?,jim
47572,I'm delivering it from the fridge. It's like a porno. Hey did anyone order a pizza?,andy
47574,Yeah and we're not about to make love. I just thought maybe you'd want to eat lunch at your desk today so that during lunch we could go down to the warehouse and bang out a few tunes.,andy
47576,Uh you tell me [Kevin playing drums with chicken legs],andy
47582,It's going to be good to have someone hot at Pam's desk huh?,pam
47584,I'm kidding! Oh my gosh you guys! She's obviously super cute I get it. But I'd like to point out there's 50 pounds more of me to love if that's your thing.,pam
47587,Thank you. Really you guys thank you. Very sweet.,pam
47590,Really well thank you all.,pam
47594,Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what you're saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.,dwight
47596,No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.,dwight
47598,Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. That's right. You're fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.,dwight
47599,"[scatting] Ske-be-do-bah-bap-bah-de, ske-be-de-bapa-de-bapa-boopa-dooten-bebe-daten-booray.",andy
47601,Thank you. I think I said doop instead of boop at one point.,andy
47604,"[sees Robert California enter] Hey Robert, are we meeting early?",andy
47606,Well we're all musicians and we play together sometimes.,andy
47608,Thank you.,andy
47612,Miss no more! What do you play? Join us!,andy
47615,[to Kevin] CEOs don't play tambourines. Tambourines are for girlfriends.,andy
47617,Great!,andy
47620,"I had totally given up on hanging out with Robert California and now he wants to be in our band! And when you're in a rock and roll band with somebody, you're bonded for life!",andy
47622,"Yeah, even cooler.",andy
47624,Hey.,pam
47625,Hey.,jim
47626,Helen Mirren. Hot?,pam
47627,Yeah. Super pretty.,jim
47628,Huh. What about Cathy?,pam
47629,The temp?,jim
47630,Yeah. Do you think she's hot?,pam
47631,Nope.,jim
47632,"I'm not asking if you're in to her. Just, objectively, do you find her attractive?",pam
47633,"And I'm telling you, I don't.",jim
47634,You don't find Cathy attractive?,pam
47635,"No, I don't.",jim
47636,"No, I'm not going to tell my nine-months-pregnant wife that I find her replacement objectively attractive. Just like I'm not going to tell my two-year-old daughter that violent video games are objectively more fun. It's true, but it doesn't help anybody.",jim
47637,Look at her. Even I want some fries with that shake.,pam
47638,"Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good? [Jim leaves]",jim
47639,That's just absurd.,dwight
47640,"Yes, because she's hot, right?",pam
47641,"Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on.",dwight
47642,"The thing about pregnancy is people treat you differently. Like you're a kid almost. They lose all sense of boundaries. They start acting weird, telling you things that clearly aren't true. I know it sounds nuts, but I think Dwight is the only one who's telling me the truth.",pam
47643,"Dwight, am I hot right now?",pam
47644,"Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction.",dwight
47645,What about before? Was I attractive before?,pam
47646,"Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low.",dwight
47647,Hmm. I think Jim's lying to me about not being attracted to Cathy.,pam
47648,You think Jim's lying? [laughs] That's so cute. I know he's lying.,dwight
47649,Five bucks if you can get him to admit it.,pam
47650,Done. [Pam goes for a high five] I never touch a pregnant woman.,dwight
47651,"Yep, that's the Dwight I need.",pam
47652,"If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules.",dwight
47653,Okay.,pam
47654,Rule one: our only loyalty is to the truth.,dwight
47655,I think so. Okay.,pam
47656,Rule two: we stop at nothing.,dwight
47657,"Well, what does that... is that... okay.",pam
47658,Rule three: Don't fall in love.,dwight
47659,"Yep, good.",pam
47660,We're gonna bust this guy.,dwight
47661,Honesty is very important to me.,pam
47662,So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.,dwight
47663,Let's just see how we feel when we get there.,pam
47665,None taken. What do you got?,dwight
47667,Hmm.,pam
47676,"Yeah, absolutely!",andy
47684,Midnight what?,andy
47686,"Hey, I was talking to Cathy. Turns out she is single.",pam
47687,"Oh, I stand corrected.",jim
47688,I thought it might be fun to set her up with someone. Any ideas?,pam
47689,"Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.",jim
47690,"Mike Tibbets, really?",pam
47691,Mm-hmm.,jim
47693,Not his mom's car.,jim
47695,Touche?,jim
47697,"Kelly, calm down.",pam
47699,I don't think Jim cares about his hair.,pam
47701,I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer.,dwight
47702,Jim's on to me.,pam
47703,Hmm?,dwight
47704,"Yeah, Jim barely talks to Mike. We had to go through like two levels of friends to even find his profile. Jim picked someone just unattractive enough to shut me up without tipping it.",pam
47705,Just ugly enough to have deniability.,dwight
47706,Yep.,pam
47707,"Mike Tibbets is like the most boring-looking guy I know. So if that was for the matchmaker test, I think I'm in the clear. If that wasn't for the matchmaker test, then... Cathy, he's a really nice guy.",jim
47708,"Well, Jim may be lying with his words, but he can't lie with his body.",dwight
47710,"No, Kelly, don't.",pam
47711,"The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there.",dwight
47713,With the crotch.,dwight
47715,Psst. We're not here. [slips Toblerone candy to Creed],dwight
47717,Exactly.,dwight
47719,"Okay, just shut it.",dwight
47720,Is he puffing out his chest?,pam
47721,I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken. [Jim says something and Cathy laughs] Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?,dwight
47722,No. Maybe he just said something funny.,pam
47723,"Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.",dwight
47724,I think he's just making her laugh.,pam
47725,Time for me to find out.,dwight
47726,Why's he making her laugh so much?,pam
47727,"Just going to walk over here- [fake trips] whoa, whoa, I'm slipping and falling! Oh, stumbling, I need something to grab on to! [grabs Jim's crotch]",dwight
47728,Dwight!,jim

47731,Dwight! Dwight!,jim
47732,Yes? [Jim pushes Dwight's hands away] Wha- Jim.,dwight
47733,[to Cathy] Sorry about that.,jim
47734,"Aw, cramp, I'm just- [grabs Jim's crotch again]",dwight
47735,Dwight! [pushes Dwight's hands away] Why?,jim
47736,"I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance.",dwight
47737,Leave.,jim
47738,"[to Pam] Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing.",dwight
47739,Why was he making her laugh so much?,pam
47740,"Oh, hey, I'll just be a second.",pam
47742,Okay.,pam
47744,Mm-hmm?,jim
47746,[laughs] Told you.,jim
47748,"Oscar, Cathy has a question!",pam
47750,[to Jim] Yeah?,pam
47751,You okay?,jim
47752,Why won't you just admit that she's attractive? It's kind of annoying that you won't say it.,pam
47753,"Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?",jim
47754,"Well, Dwight had this idea, and I thought it was kind of crazy. But maybe that's where we are now.",pam
47755,"She called it crazy? Aw, man, that's insulting. All I did was propose a makeshift lie-detector test. Monitoring his blood pressure, pulse, perspiration, and breathing rate.",dwight
47756,"Yeah, its nuts. But I don't know what else to do.",pam
47757,And she called it nuts?,dwight
47760,Did you know that Lisa toured with Chaka Khan?,andy
47766,"Well, we are playing. We're all playing together. These are our jam buddies. It's a jam session. We go where the music takes us. [music starts]",andy
47768,Come on.,dwight
47769,Stop shoving me.,jim
47770,"[mocking] Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.",dwight
47771,[to Pam] Really?,jim
47772,This could all go away if you just tell me the truth.,pam
47774,"Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man? [to Jim] Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?",dwight
47775,Si.,jim
47776,"Wait, that's it? That's the question you're going to ask him?",pam
47777,We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.,dwight
47779,"[mimicking] Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.",dwight
47780,"Okay, Dwight, come on. [to old man] You can go first.",jim
47782,"Jim, are you serious?",dwight
47783,"Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.",jim
47784,Maybe we could switch instruments.,andy
47786,"Cause, uh, my body's starting to get bruised.",andy
47788,We had to leave because of creative differences.,andy
47792,Well-,andy
47794,"[to old man] Okay, you're done.",dwight
47796,"Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?",dwight
47797,"No, I'm not worried. Because this lie isn't for me, it's for Pam. And when she gets her body back and her confidence back... yes, I will tell her the truth. That I had feelings for a co-worker today that I haven't had in years. But in my defense, he was grabbing my crotch fairly aggressively at the time.",jim
47798,Do you find Cathy Simms attractive?,dwight
47799,No.,jim
47800,"Yep, he's lying.",dwight
47801,"Ah, see, was that so hard?",pam
47802,I am not lying.,jim
47803,Really?,pam
47804,"Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?",jim
47805,"I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?",dwight
47806,"Wait, what?",pam
47807,"Look at the numbers. Every single time, it's come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar.",dwight
47808,"Jim, you have high blood pressure.",pam
47809,"Oh, he is definitely attracted to her.",dwight
47810,Doesn't your dad have high blood pressure?,pam
47811,"Yeah, but I don't smoke.",jim
47812,When was the last time you went to the doctor?,pam
47813,I don't know.,jim
47814,It's important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-,dwight
47815,"Dwight, stop. I'm not kidding, I mean, I need you to take care of yourself. What would we do if something happened to you?",pam
47816,"Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul.",jim
47817,"It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.",dwight
47818,Okay.,jim
47819,"Come on, let's go. I wanna call your doctor.",pam
47820,Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?,dwight
47821,Just go home. It doesn't matter.,pam
47822,"But... hey, Cece's toothbrush.",dwight
47823,Thank you.,jim
47829,[scatting] Rudit-do-do-do-di-do.,andy
47832,"Hey! All right, obviously we all want to die but we have to get through this. So, Gabe go ahead. It's okay.",andy
47834,[whispers to Jim] I'm gonna do it.,pam
47836,Oh! I'm going into labor! Oh my goodness!,pam
47837,"Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody!",jim

47860,How do you feel?,jim
47864,False alarm.,pam
47865,"[on the phone] What?! They took another client from us? Okay, bye. Man! Business is war! Customers, clients- it's like a war out there.",andy
47866,I am a leader. But you can only inspire people so much in a place like this. So today I'm turning the inspire-factor up to ten with a little help from my friend America's bloodiest battle.,andy
47867,Why even read business books? We should be studying war. Going to places like Gettysburg. Where is that?,andy
47869,"[gags, coughs] Well we should take a fieldtrip there. I mean, that would be so cool. I wonder if that bus downstairs is-",andy
47871,That sounds super inspiring! I'm in!,andy
47872,Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.,dwight
47874,Ha!,dwight
47875,The Civil War history industry has conveniently forgotten about the battle of Schrute Farms. [scoffs] Whatever. I'm over it. It's just grossly irresponsible.,dwight
47876,Charge!,andy
47878,"Yeah, well, the bus has free wifi and I made special low-sugar lunches for everyone. And is anyone kosher or halal?",andy
47880,"Dates, tabbouleh, and a bagel with cream cheese.",andy
47882,"You know, it's the same as the kosher option. There's a lesson in there. I mean, I can't force you to go. You're not my slaves. Thanks to Gettysburg. But... who's coming with me?",andy
47885,Guess I'm a sucker for historical fiction.,dwight
47886,"Anyone who's not going, you're dead to me. You're uninvited. I don't want you to come. But, FYI, there will be leftover turkey and pesto sammies in the fridge.",andy

47891,Cool. Thanks. [puts his hat on Erin's head],jim

47898,"All right, all right, all right.",andy
47900,Here. Like it?,pam

47912,You guys...,andy
47914,Get excited!,andy
47916,All right! We're here. Limitless can wait.,andy
47918,Woo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen the eighteen hundreds await you. We can watch Limitless on the way back.,andy
47921,Woo!,andy
47922,"Whoa, where you going?",andy
47923,"Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?",jim
47924,"Yeah, we're not going to the visitor center. We're not tourists.",andy
47925,"No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour.",jim

47932,...nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms.,dwight
47934,"Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush. [laughs] I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written.",dwight
47936,The truth.,dwight
47939,"No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth.",dwight
47941,"Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.",dwight
47943,"Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this-",dwight
47945,"Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?",dwight
47947,Not by a long shot!,dwight
47950,"No, it was not!",dwight
47952,"No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?",dwight

47972,"Excuse me, I got a question for you.",dwight
47974,Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?,dwight
47976,"Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?",dwight
47978,We don't need to bother this poor gentleman. I know exactly where we're going. Giddy up! Tallyho!,andy
47985,"Okay. You know the test booklets that they give out in all the schools. I was thinking that we could put a coupon in the back that people would mail in to us... and as, you know, as I tell it, I don't like it. Unless, of course, you are responding to it.",pam

48004,"Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry.",jim
48005,Hunger! Hunger for victory! Hunger for honor. Hunger for pride.,andy
48009,"Exactly. Now do you know the Civil War soldiers were hungry for? Pride! Now, each battalion had its own flag and they guarded these flags with their lives. Colonel Harrison Jeffords of the Fourth Michigan Infantry saw his flag being carried away, chased it down with nothing but a sword. Fought tooth and nail at the foot of that flag until he died. He wasn't about to let them have that flag. Pride. Right, guys? [holds up flag] I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin. Cost me two hundred dollars.",andy
48010,Only two hundred dollars?,jim

48016,Its' I mean come on.,andy
48018,Alright fine.  You know what ' I guess this place just hasn't rubbed off on you the way I hoped it would.  I'm still going.  And I'm not going to ask anymore.  I'm not even going to look back.  I'm just going to assume that you're with me.,andy
48019,[Andy looks back to find everyone sitting] You said you weren't going to look back.,dwight
48025,Really?,dwight

48058,What are you talking about?,jim
48059,Our office has a disease.  And it goes by many names.  Sarcasm.  Snark.  Wisecracks.  You take things people care about and you make them feel lame about it with your jokes.  That's what you did with this trip.,andy
48060,Andy ' this whole idea of our situation being just like war?  It's just not true.  We just work at a paper company.  And you're our regional manager.  And guess what man?  You don't have to prove anything.  We like you as regional manager.  Andy if you don't believe me take a look at what's on my head.  I'm wearing a very pink hat.  I've been getting weird looks all day because I'm pretty sure 'DM does GB' means something kinda sexual.  But guess who's wearing them?  All of us.  Just for you man.  That's huge.,jim
48061,You don't like the hats?,andy
48062,They're terrible.,jim

I wanted my team to be, like, this army and I was their general.  But I guess it's really more like they're just people who work in an office and I'm their manager.  Yeah that's really probably a better analogy now that I think about it.",andy

48102,"[enters office doing Michael Jackson impression] Everybody beat it. Don't beat it, stay where you are.",andy
48104,What did you say?,andy
48106,What would you say?,andy
48108,"That is exactly the right thing to say! Do it! Git-er-done! Phyllis, you just married Joe Order, you're new name is Phyllis Order [fill this order], get it?",andy
48110,"Jim, in regards to our high-five scheduled for four PM today, it has been moved up to now. Yes.",andy
48111,We didn't have one scheduled.,jim
48112,"[knocks water bottle on to Jim's desk] Oh, little help. Wow your hair is really thinning.",dwight
48113,"Standing is proven to be healthier, increases productivity and just looks cooler. Picture someone doing something heroic. Now was he sitting or standing? Not counting FDR.",dwight
48114,Every second you sit there is an hour off your life. Look at all of you. I feel like you're in a suicide cult.,dwight
48116,Oh yeah?,dwight
48118,"Hey guys let's just all admit it. Ok? Dwight's better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And he's never, ever going to go back on it right?",jim
48119,That's right Jim.,dwight
48121,[jumping up from an almost sitting position] Hey.,dwight
48123,No. Putting a load on more like it.,dwight
48125,Last thing I need is luck. [hunches down again],dwight
48126,[to Angela] Thank you so much. [hums],dwight
48127,[sees a pole poking out Dwight's pant leg] What are you up to? Oops look out! [grabs Dwight's wallet],jim
48128,What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!,dwight
48129,Prank! [throws money from Dwight's wallet on the floor],jim
48130,Oh that's real creative.,dwight
48131,You know what it's not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?,jim
48132,"I could, but I just don't feel like it loser.",dwight
48133,Because you're sitting?,jim
48134,Standing.,dwight
48135,Ok.,jim
48136,Don't!,dwight
48137,Because you're sitting?,jim
48138,Standing.,dwight
48139,You know I have to do this.,jim
48140,"I know. [Jim pushes him over, Dwight screams]",dwight
48141,[signing his name] Andrew' Baines' Bernard.,andy
48142,I think you could just do Andy Bernard.,jim
48143,"Andrew Baines Bernard. I love filling these out. Because it's like taking a test, but I know the answers.",andy
48145,What was that?,andy
48146,I don't know. He wasn't talking to me. But if I were you I wouldn't hire his wife.,jim
48152,Hey there. It's a pleasure.,andy
48154,I would love to. But I have to be completely honest with you guys. We're 100 percent staffed up.,andy
48156,Alright.,andy
48157,"Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock.",dwight
48159,[laughs] Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?,dwight
48161,Well today's your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?,dwight
48163,Your path from obesity begins right here!,dwight
48165,"Obese people in my office are a drain on resources. Chairs wear out faster, it takes more Freon to keep them cool, they flush the toilets more often, plus their massive BMs bust the rivets on my pipes. But a gym turns fat into cash.",dwight
48166,Alright! The DM Express is pulling out.,andy
48171,We will start here at Erinville.,andy
48174,Reception. Your classic one-man operation.,andy
48176,I was watching a movie and a bunch of apes took over San Francisco. Just saying.,andy
48178,I'll explore exploring it.,andy
48180,Ok uh next stop on the tour sales. Here we go. Station stop Jim Halpert. Oh boy our resident truth teller. [Jim laughs nervously] Alright have at it. Let 'er rip. What do you hate about this place?,andy
48181,Well it's sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.,jim
48182,Maybe you do. Hi. I'm Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? It's paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.,dwight
48183,Jim?,andy
48184,Well it's not that easy. It's kind of sometimes difficult.,jim
48185,It's the second easiest job in the world. [to camera] Being a mom.,dwight
48187,That is true.,dwight
48188,You know if you joined our sales department you would be working very closely with our department head Mr. Dwight Schrute.,andy
48189,That's me.,dwight
48190,Dwight why don't you tell Susan about some of your hobbies. Survival skills. Ranking of animals.,andy
48191,Maybe over a beer after she's closed her first sale [makes gun click noise].,dwight
48193,Oh how am I supposed to pull this off? [montage of office workers in friendly interactions with Susan]. The entire office is being nice to her than they've ever been to me. What I wouldn't give for one of Phyllis' classic room clearing farts right now.,andy
48194,Ready? What do you think?,dwight
48196,"You haven't even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke [squats, grunts and lifts] Right? Dedicated phone book ripping station [tries and fails to tear a phone book in half]. You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now let's go over membership. I'm going to need the first month's and the last month's up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month'",dwight
48198,Darryl... [picks up sledgehammer and swings it at a hanging tire],dwight
48201,But we already have a surplus of accountants as it is.,andy
48203,Those are fully staffed as well.,andy
48205,[laughing nervously] Yes.,andy
48207,Let me beat around the bush for a second. Our chairman of the board has some very strong feelings about-,andy
48210,There are lots of considerations.,andy
48212,Alright. Well then welcome aboard.,andy
48214,We get you over to HR and then we get you set up with accounting. [phone rings] Hang on. Hello?,andy
48216,Hi gam-gam.,andy
48218,Are you taking your med-meds?,andy
48221,We promised we'd never say goodbye.,andy
48222,Attention! I am now accepting memberships for Dwight Schrute's Gym for Muscles. The first 20 members can take advantage of the pay what you weigh promotion.,dwight
48227,Kelly?,dwight
48229,That's okay. I know how to build a business. You gotta get the black people to do it to get the white people to do it. Then you gotta get the black people to stop doing it. One step at a time.,dwight
48235,"[sees Susan is busy in the annex] Hey, uh, guys. So Robert doesn't want his wife working here. So now that she is, we have to drive her away.",andy
48240,"I am not asking, I am ordering.",andy
48242,"It would be great if she were gone by lunch. Erin, you're up. Find her a place to work, but not too comfortable.",andy
48248,"No, I don't think we should be trying to make this place seem unpleasant. I think we should let this place just crush her spirit by itself. I mean, it knows what it's doing.",jim
48250,"Oh, wow. So cute.",jim
48260,Very cute. [holds out the phone],jim
48266,[in robot voice] What is going on?,andy
48268,"Okey-dokey, artichokey. You hate it, don't you?",andy
48270,Why would you say that?,andy
48272,"It's not that, exactly.",andy
48274,"Let's just say that if you don't want to work here, I am totally prepared to respect that.",andy
48276,I don't know. [chuckles],andy
48278,Yes! The dude is an enigma.,andy
48280,Ah... [stammers],andy
48282,What do you think you're doing?,dwight
48284,"I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?",dwight
48286,I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?,dwight
48288,Eight minutes!,dwight
48290,Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings? [points] I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James!,dwight
48292,That's what I said.,dwight
48294,I know.,dwight
48295,[to Susan] Cameras...,andy
48299,It just was one of those things-,andy
48311,Yes?,andy
48314,No games?,andy
48316,"Okay. I mean, it was kind of funny, actually. Robert storms in and he says, 'in four seconds, my wife's gonna be in here. I told her she could work here. Under no circumstances can that be allowed to happen.' [laughs]",andy
48319,I am lying. I am a compulsive liar.,andy
48321,"No, it's not. I tell the truth most of the time and I was just telling the truth about your husband. Jim knows. He was there.",andy
48327,"[to Hank who is closing the gate] Oh wait, wait, wait! Hold on, hold on. I just need to get through. Just real quick. Real quick, open... uh, okay. [runs]",jim
48329,"[shoe falls while climbing ladder] Oh. Ow. Ow. Ow. [grunts] Creed. I was never here, all right?",jim
48331,Oh boy.,jim
48332,"This is my gym, my rules. You do exactly as I say, no questions asked.",dwight
48334,"First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.",dwight
48336,Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!,dwight
48341,"[grabs Jim's leg] No, no. No, no, no! Don't! Damn it, Tuna!",andy
48343,Do I?,jim
48345,"[mutters] I know, I do.",jim
48346,"Jim, I've had enough of your unhelpfulness.",andy
48347,I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can...,jim
48349,"That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's something: I feel that maybe, if we take a step back, this is a simple case of anxiety to work with a spouse.",jim
48350,[laughs] I think we've got ourselves an answer.,andy
48352,That makes complete sense. Thank you all for a wonderful day.,andy
48353,Perfect!,jim
48355,Yes?,jim
48357,"[sighs] I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking.",jim
48359,Yes. All right. Great. [leaves],jim
48360,Uh...,andy
48362,Yep.,andy
48366,"Hey, Mrs. California.",andy
48368,"You know, honestly, we all wanted you to work there. Except for him. Especially me.",andy
48370,Yeah.,andy
48372,Yeah.,andy
48374,Who knows?,andy
48376,Totally.,andy
48378,Hmm?,andy
48379,"You're nothing! You're so weak, you call yourself a man? Huh?",dwight
48381,"Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!",dwight
48383,"All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?",dwight
48385,"No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?",dwight
48387,What do you want!?!,dwight
48389,Val Kilmer? I don't buy it. That doesn't make any sense. Wow... I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.,dwight
48392,"Hey, what are you listening to?",dwight
48395,There is no shower.,dwight
48397,"What does this look like, a shower store? Get lost.",dwight
48399,"Exercise lengthens life. Improves mood, boosts sex drive, and I've already covered the BM of it all. It's miraculous the effect that I will have on their lives.",dwight
48400,"So, Roberto Californio doesn't want to work with his wife. I get it. And, he wants to give his wife a job. Totally get it. What I am struggling with is the part of this that's impossible.",andy
48402,This whole thing is making me very uncomfortable. I'm not getting between the boss and his wife so just ask me about something else. You know Stanley's tie is really the story of the day...,jim
48404,"Ok, so that's a disaster. Luckily have a two-part plan. One, run. Two, hide. It's pretty smart, right? [walks into Vance Refrigeration office] Hi, how you doing? I'm Jim Halpert from across the hall. We are redoing our supply closet and I was wondering if I could take a look at yours for some ideas.",jim
48406,"You absolutely should. He said it was ok, so till you get him, I'll just be in, you know. [closes door behind him to supply closet]",jim
48408,Ugh! He's always one step ahead of us! How does he do that?,andy
48411,"[Singing as if he were the dolls in his office] Christmas tiiiime is heeeere! [Normal voice] Wow. Thanks guys, that sounded amazing. Hi, I'm Andy Bernard and I am the first office Santa ever to make holiday wishes come true.",andy
48412,Who's excited to get their holiday wishes?,andy
48414,"What's that, Stanley?",andy
48416,It is important to be mindful of all belief systems at our holiday party.,andy
48418,I got Stanley tickets to see Lewis Black for his birthday. ...Might not have been the best idea.,jim
48421,"Fulfilled! Brought my bicycle, so I can be your designated driver later. In the event that you drink to much, which is by no means required.",andy
48422,What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?,dwight
48423,"That, I cannot do, but I did get you an acre of property on the moon.",andy
48424,Where? Dark side or light side?,dwight
48425,Light side.,andy
48426,Is it by the Sea of Tranquility?,dwight
48427,"As a matter of fact, yes. Directly adjacent....beachfront.",andy
48428,"Thank you, Andy.",dwight
48429,"So, who's wish is next? Oh, what about Santa's wish? My biggest wish is that you all get along well with Jessica....C'mon guys, Jessica?...Jim, tell 'em who Jessica is.",andy
48430,"She's not your grandmother, is she?",jim
48431,"Ugh! Gam-gam's name is Ruth, Jim, you should know. I introduced you on speakerphone that time?",andy
48432,Yeah.,jim
48433,"Jessica is my super serious girlfriend, who is seriously awesome and seriously sexy. Only thing that's not serious, by the way? Our repartee.",andy
48435,"Totally out of your league. So in summation, ho ho ho, please be nice to Jessica and mistletoe is not an excuse for sexual assault, and don't go near Gam-gam.",andy
48452,"Well you came to the right place....Ah, this, this party'll cheer you right up.",andy
48454,"Oh, thank you.",andy
48455,"Well, I hate to have to take my Santa hat off, and put on my hard ass hat. [puts on baseball cap that has a foam rear-end on it with the words 'HARD ASS'] But, this is serious. It's come to my attention that somebody who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.",andy
48456,Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.,dwight
48457,It wasn't me.,jim
48458,It wasn't either of you.,andy
48459,Kathy wants to leave our clump?,jim
48460,Sh sh sh sh! Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.,andy
48461,"I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense. [punches Jim in the arm]",dwight
48462,"Ow, What are you doing? [Jim fights back]",jim
48463,Hey! Hey! Respect the hat!,andy
48464,Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.,jim
48465,Alright. I'm gonna speak in a language you both understand....Mo-nay.,andy
48466,What was that?,jim
48467,What is it?,dwight
48468,"Money....You both have sizable Christmas bonuses coming your way. If I catch either of you messing with the other, I will give both bonuses to the other person.",andy
48469,Can't do that.,jim
48470,"No, absolutely not.",dwight
48471,You need consequences. OK? I want you both walking on eggshells.,andy
48477,"My ex is meeting my sex....which is always scary, you know? And not just because you think they might talk about your penis...that's just part of it.",andy
48478,"Hey! Jess, Erin, I hope you're not talking about my penis. [laughs and kisses Jessica on the cheek] Hi.",andy
48480,"Hey everyone! I want you to meet Jessica, she is an assistant cross country coach at Bryn Mawr.",andy
48482,"Erin, by the way, amazing receptionist.",andy
48485,What?,andy
48488,Oh no.,andy
48490,"Ut oh, it's kicking in. Spontaneous scoliosis.",andy
48507,Ah...[sees Dwight's wallet and open email] I'm gonna s- [see's Dwight watching from break room],jim
48508,"Dwight really wants my bonus. He's trying to entrap me. Oh god, now I can't drink at this thing....I get really pranky when I drink.",jim
48528,"[on phone] Uh, yeah. I just got my replacement credit card...you want the number? Oh it's uh four seven nine three, zero zero three two, three three one three. The security code is nine two seven. OK great. Thank you very much. Bye.",jim
48529,"So Dwight did take the bait. He used my credit card numbers to send a two hundred dollar bouquet of flowers, to my wife...from me.",jim
48530,[laughing] Boom!,dwight
48543,Edgy impressions.,andy
48545,How many drinks have you had tonight? I can't be driving everybody home.,andy
48547,Whoa! Maybe you should take a break.,andy
48549,Ah! I've been attacked! Oh my god! Oh! Someone put a porcupine in my drawer!,dwight
48551,"Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!",dwight
48552,"I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?",jim
48553,Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?,dwight
48554,Hmm...,jim
48559,Hello? Lacerated hand here folks.,dwight
48560,"Nice try, this is ridiculous.",jim
48561,Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.,dwight
48562,Three times.,jim
48563,You see?,dwight
48564,"Jim, this has your fingerprints all over it.",andy
48565,"Andy, you've gotta be kidding me.",jim
48568,"OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control...",jim
48569,Might wanna run that by Angela cause it's so cute.,dwight
48571,"[on phone] Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.",jim
48572,Come down right away!,dwight
48573,"[on phone]Uh, I don't know, let me ask. [to Dwight] Uh, were you quilled?",jim
48574,"Yes, I was quilled.",dwight
48575,And what's it's name?,jim
48576,Henrietta.,dwight
48577,Oops. [hangs up],jim
48578,"What? ...Alright, get her out of here, Dwight.",andy
48582,OK!,andy
48585,"Um, yeah, she's not always like that. It's um...",andy
48587,"Yeah, uh, excuse me.",andy
48589,Yep. [leaves Jessica to talk to Erin] Hey!,andy
48591,Have you had anything to eat besides candy canes?,andy
48593,OK...maybe I should make you some oatmeal or something.,andy
48596,"Ah, OK.",andy
48598,"That's not what it should be, it should just be like a trinket or something.",andy
48600,"You you, wait. You mean you wish she wasn't here or something.",andy
48602,"Hey, you know, you can't say that, OK? That's my girlfriend that you're talking about. You and I are not together anymore. You need to get over it! Take your wish back.",andy
48609,I swear...,andy
48611,I was too embarrassed! [group laughs],andy
48612,"Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk. [shows picture of Cici with devil doodles] Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?",jim
48614,Yes. It is.,jim
48615,Um.,andy
48617,Cici is Jim's daughter.,andy
48619,"I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.",jim
48621,I don't-,jim
48622,I know who did this....Dwight.,andy
48624,Yeah.,jim
48625,Dwight.,andy
48628,Yeah. He is gonna pay. This is fire-able.,andy
48629,O...K.,jim
48630,"It's, I mean.",andy
48631,"Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, it's a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like...",jim
48633,Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.,jim
48636,"I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.",jim
48637,"Enough of this garbage. [harshly places boom box on table and hits play] This is Christmas. [Christmas Eve by Trans-Siberian Orchestra plays. Dwight plays air violin/guitar and sings along] Hi-yah!!!!! [gabe, Creed and Nate join in as shots show various gift giving] Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!!",dwight
48638,"You alright, Santa?",jim
48639,"You know those movies where two friends are sleeping together and it's like, hey, can they stay friends?",andy
48640,Yes.,jim
48641,Do you think two friends who are not sleeping together can stay friends?,andy
48642,"Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.",jim
48643,"No...I don't, hmm, I don't know.",andy
48644,OK.,jim
48645,"By the way, I'm not gonna mess with you and Dwight's bonuses. I think it's causing more problems. So just be yourselves, have fun, and try not to let it affect your work.",andy
48646,Alright. I will definitely do that.,jim
48647,"Alright, I'll tell Dwight.",andy
48648,"You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway.",jim
48649,Christmas miracles do happen.,andy
48650,Yes. They totally do.,jim
48679,OK great.,andy
48681,Perfect.,andy
48683,"I would, it just, that wasn't the holiday wish.",andy
48687,"OK, bye. [helps Meredith off the floor] Alright Meredith,",andy
48689,You bet.,andy
48690,"Thank god Erin's getting a ride home with Robert because she is trashed. [laughs] and who better to drive her home than Robert, I mean, what a stand up guy, you know? I mean he's going through a lot, separating from his wife, showing up to the Christmas party in a track suit and a blazer,",andy
48691,"Let's go, let's go.",andy
48693,Hang on.,andy
48695,What?,andy
48697,What is all that?,andy
48699,It's junk!,andy
48701,You're a hoarder. My god!,andy
48703,Ah! My Santa suit's stuck.,andy
48704,"[laughs while spray painting 'Jim is Awesome' on his own car, talks to porcupine in carrier] What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh?",dwight
48706,"Sh, sh, sh, sh, shh.",andy
48708,Oh my god.,andy
48710,"Meredith, shut your drunk hole right now.",andy
48714,I'm sure I am not. Let's get you home.,andy
48716,Whoo.,andy
48717,"[yawns, 'Idiot' is written on his forehead] Ah, man. Ah, fell asleep, took a nap. Hey guys, ah I feel refreshed now. How's it goin?",dwight
48719,"Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at?",dwight
48720,"Oh man, I was supposed to tell Dwight something......C'mon, Jim. [shakes head] I got nothin'.",jim
48722,"Oh, uh. Well, we thought we wouldn't put the alcohol out till 11AM. It's just...common...decency.",andy
48733,"It's come to my attention that someone, who shall remain nameless, wants to switch desk clumps.",andy
48734,Cathy wants to leave our clump?,jim
48735,Don't look. Who it was is not important...but she did say that your constant pranking and one-upsmanship is driving her crazy. She or he.,andy
48736,Hey. Enjoy your new clump.,dwight
48738,"It's so much closer to the bathroom, right?",dwight
48740,Uh huh.,dwight
48741,Sorry it didn't work out. Hope you find what you're looking for.,jim
48743,That's ok.,jim
48744,You'll be fine over there.,dwight
48746,"That'd be great, thank you. [Erin throws package, it hits Kathy. She thinks it was Jim who threw it]",jim
48747,"So, I got this bucket from Jim's garage and I filled it with everything disgusting. Except excrement. I can't wait to see the look on his face when that falls on my face. [laughs, then camera shows bucket being dumped on Kathy] Dammit Kathy!",dwight
48748,"For the past month, I have been collecting wishes from everyone in the office, and I intend to make good on every single one of them.",andy
48749,"Oh, I see.",andy
48750,"Now look, I may not have a great laugh like Santa, or a flying sled. But tell you what I do have. A Prius, a heart of freaking gold....",andy
48752,"Alright, you got it.",andy
48753,...and an American Express green card.,andy
48754,"Ryan, for your holiday wish, you wanted ten sick days.",andy
48756,Well I'll do you one better.,andy
48758,I got you health insurance.,andy
48760,"Yeah! Right? But with great perks come great responsibility, so I'm gonna be expecting a lot more from you...no more zoning out in your office.",andy
48762,Yes!,andy
48765,Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.,dwight
48768,"All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to.",jim
48769,It was a raccoon! Eating a hamburger like a person!,andy
48770,You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane.,dwight
48771,"Okay, done.",jim
48774,"All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-",jim
48775,"[writing on board] Love letters, yes! I love it. What else can be done with paper?",andy
48776,You can write a book about chairs.,jim
48777,"Books! Excellent, Jim.",andy
48779,"[gasps] Shh! Did you hear that? Infinity! There is an infinity of things that you can do with paper! Now, who wants to buy some paper? [scattered applause]",andy
48780,Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is.,jim
48781,"I'm talking about you guys! Who in this room, right now, wants to buy some paper? Let's get high on our own supply!",andy
48783,Yes!,andy
48784,"Robert said that we needed to double our sales growth to eight percent by the end of the quarter. That's today. And we're eight hundred and thirty dollars short. And I can't afford to keep buying paper from us. So today, we need to sell eight hundred and thirty dollars of paper and the next quarter I need to sell the twenty-two hundred dollars of paper that's in my garage.",andy
48785,"Animals, machines, vast virtual armies. All of these things I have successfully managed. The only thing I haven't managed is people. I saw an ad on the Sabre website for an open manager position in their printers division. I spoke to Robert California about it and he said for me to come by and see him sometime. So, like a Spanish conquistador, I have come to Florida to claim what is rightfully mine.",dwight
48786,Dwight Schrute for Robert California!,dwight
48788,I'm not here to be given anything. I'm here to take what is mine.,dwight
48791,Gabe? You don't know?,dwight
48793,"Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office.",dwight
48796,Robert.,dwight
48798,Yes.,dwight
48800,Very good.,dwight
48801,"Hey C-span. So my dad says an accountant can really help you out, if they're willing to 'play ball.' Those were his words.",andy
48803,So make that error!,andy
48807,"Well, it's just, I know that making errors sounds like your kind of thing, but it's a little more complicated than that.",andy
48809,"It's just, I really need a real accountant on this. [to Oscar] What do you say?",andy
48811,Oh.,andy
48813,What?,andy
48815,You know what? Go. Have fun.,andy
48816,There's a trivia contest at a bar in Philadelphia.,andy
48817,Stop right there. I love it.,jim
48819,I didn't even say what it is.,andy
48821,In Philadelphia.,jim
48822,"But here's the best part. The prize is a thousand dollars, and if we win, we can use that money to buy paper here, close the gap on our eight percent profit increase...",andy
48823,That's a great idea.,jim
48825,Yeah? You like it?,andy
48826,Yeah.,jim
48827,All right.,andy
48828,"All right, good stuff.",jim
48829,"I'm so psyched you guys are into it because I thought- I was like, 'this sounds really stupid.'",andy
48831,There is one problem with this plan.,andy
48833,"We'd have to leave work, like, right now, to do this.",andy
48835,"Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy.",dwight
48837,Meat grinder.,dwight
48839,"You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic.",dwight
48841,But I can give you this pitch in one minute-,dwight
48844,Still an important position. Still a chief.,dwight
48850,"You left us no choice, but, this should put a smile on your face. How would you like to be captain of the Dunder-Mifflin team? Although I reserve the right to overrule you.",andy
48852,I've got a quota to hit. I don't care how I hit it.,andy
48854,I thought it was a fun idea.,jim
48856,"Wait, what? Everyone in here is gay?",andy
48860,It says that I believe that my staff's intelligence and that I'm willing to try anything. [Oscar's friend walks up] Not anything.,andy
48862,"Uh, all right. We need to divide up into teams, but it's winner-take-all so no need to divide evenly. We need an A-team, a backup team and a just-have-fun team. So you guys all know yourselves.",andy
48866,A-team.,andy
48867,Okay.,jim
48868,"All right, everybody. Nice self-awareness. Except... [looks at Kevin, who has joined the A-team]",andy
48870,There's a table over here.,jim
48872,"Oh, we got this!",andy
48882,[sniffs] There's no fires within eight miles of here.,dwight
48884,"What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO's office on the phone this instant!",dwight
48888,"Jim, Darryl. Your time to shine.",andy
48889,Shawn Marion.,jim
48892,"Wrong, for so many reasons.",jim
48898,"Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes.",jim
48900,"You're my sports guys! You're ESPN, you're ESPN Classic, Ryan is MSNBC. I'm E!, TLC and Oxygen.",andy
48902,"So it's a very simple argument of why I should be put in charge of southeast printer sales. Nobody has sold more printers in the northeast than me. Bottom line, I know the product. I get it!",dwight
48904,Oh my God.,dwight
48906,"Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?",dwight
48908,What's with the smile?,dwight
48910,"And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.",dwight
48912,Take me to Robert.,dwight
48914,Take me to his house.,dwight
48916,You know where it is. Lead me there.,dwight
48918,"Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let's go.",dwight
48930,[claps] All right.,jim
48932,"So the best chance of hitting our mark is now in the hands, and brains, of Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly. Do I like these odds? My answer is no.",andy
48933,Which one is it?,dwight
48935,Robert! Robert California! Robert!,dwight
48965,[dances] Whoo! Yeah!,andy
48967,Go Einsteins!,andy
48970,No thank you.,dwight
48972,"Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a riddle: A manager, a salesman, a leader and a warrior walk into a restaurant. The hostess says, 'table for one?' How is this possible?",dwight
48974,"Yes, exactly. Riddle number two: Who is going-",dwight
48976,N... it's complicated.,dwight
48978,"It's a job interview, not a flea market.",dwight
48980,Yes.,dwight
48982,"Oh, come on!",andy
49001,Einsteins! Great work.,andy
49003,"You know what I thought would be fun? Is we do like uh, a switch-em-up maybe? Since only one of us needs to win, maybe I can get Kevin and Kelly and put together an all-star team?",andy
49006,"Alright. Well just stay focused, try to concentrate.",andy
49021,"Alright, if you're not going to help us out by buying our own paper, could you sell eight hundred dollars more paper than usual today? That would be amazing.",andy
49022,"Andy, it's the last day of the quarter. We've already called all our clients, so making that much in a day is going to be tough.",jim
49023,"Not helping, tuna.",andy
49025,We gotta figure this out. Think of the look on Robert's face when we tell him we met our 8% goal.,andy
49027,"No, that's why...that's why I said think of it.",andy
49028,"Andy, we're gonna do our best. But you know what? At the end of the day seven point...whatever percent is pretty good.",jim
49031,Have I mentioned that it's also quite good for amateur animation? [flips crude animation of stick figures representing him and Robert] Took me two weeks.,andy
49032,"Oh, ugh. [stands and looks at meatball in chair] What is this, a meatball? Really? [Stanley laughs]",dwight
49033,"It's always more fun to mess with Dwight with an audience. That was usually Pam so now that she's out I had to find someone else. Turns out that Stanley is quite the comedy fan. But not everything makes him laugh. He has very specific tastes. Through a painstaking process of trial and error, I've found out what he likes. And it's really weird.",jim
49034,"Jim, come on! That's so juvenile! What the- [opens drawer full of meatballs]",dwight
49036,Ugh.,dwight
49038,"Aw, man. [Stanley laughs] This is not very clever, Jim.",dwight
49039,I know.,jim
49041,[Dwight finds stapler in giant meatball] Really Jim? Really? Very funny.,dwight
49043,Thirty-two meatballs.,dwight

49051,"My parents met Jessica and they completely flipped for her so they gave me this old family ring to use on her. I know, whoa! Pump the breaks, Bernard, too early! I get it. I just, you know, I'm just carrying it around, seeing how it feels. I haven't proposed to anyone in years... Mom took the main diamond out, she thought that had more of a my little brother kind of vibe to it, but...",andy
49052,"[Robert is looking at pictures of a house online] Whoa, looks pretty nice. Got a little bit of a Shining vibe, though.",jim
49054,Big. Stupid. Pure chump bait.,dwight
49056,"You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent.",jim
49058,"I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke.",jim
49060,"I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.",jim
49062,"Um, I'm getting reports of a serious outbreak of the grumpies in here.",andy
49064,"Well, please tell Susan we all say hi.",andy
49088,Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.,jim
49089,Oh.,andy
49090,DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.,jim
49091,"You're looking at the master of leaving parties early. They key is, you have to make a strong impression, so you want to have a picture taken, you want to say some peculiar non sequitur that people remember, you want to note something unique, a talking point, for later. I don't mean to brag, but New Year's Eve, I was home by nine.",jim
49092,"Robert, just wanted to grab you one second. This place is amazing, by the way.",jim
49094,"I bet I should. [takes cell phone photo] That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you.",jim
49096,All right-,jim
49098,I must...,jim
49100,"[hides ring] Yeah, it's pretty serious poolage.",andy

49106,Hi.,andy
49108,It's great. You know. Reliable. Great mileage.,andy

49112,No. What?,andy
49121,"All right, theres- this would be no problem. I could swim under, one breath.",andy
49123,Okay.,andy
49125,In a minute. In a minute.,andy
49127,A minute would be cool.,andy
49129,What-,dwight
49131,I'm relaxing. Scram. [pushes her],dwight
49133,"Hey, Stanley. Um, what happened to my pants?",andy
49135,"Where... [finds pants, looks for ring]",andy
49137,Oh really?,dwight
49139,"Yeah, you want to play you little hick? [kicks her in to the pool, Erin screams]",dwight
49154,"Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical.",jim
49156,Really? Why?,jim
49159,"[laughs] You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?",dwight
49161,I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it. [he picks her up],dwight
49164,You stop.,dwight
49166,"No, you stop.",dwight
49168,"Okay, you can stop.",dwight
49170,"No, you can stop.",dwight
49176,Good night.,jim
49190,"[he and Erin feed each other chips] Ah, mmm. So good. Now take a chip, crush it into my face, really rub the grease around. Do it. Now rub it in. Oh, yeah, that's so good. Ah...",dwight
49192,Damn it.,dwight
49194,We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.,dwight

49205,Yeah- oh!,dwight
49207,Woohoo! Yes!,dwight

49212,To both these bears.,jim
49219,"Kelly, that's a crazy ring you found.",andy
49221,I can't believe you're wearing it. Are you not superstitious at all?,andy
49223,"The ring of a failed marriage might have some sinister energy, right? Am I just being silly?",andy
49226,"You know what, I can just sell it and put the money in the party fund.",andy
49237,Yeah!,andy
49238,[to Erin] Maybe we should take a little break.,dwight
49240,Okay.,dwight
49242,Yeah!,andy
49245,Go!,dwight
49248,Yay! [Erin comes back up] Whoa!,andy
49250,I cannot believe you're still up!,andy

49254,"[coughs up water] Erin, did we win?",dwight
49256,You're lying. We didn't win.,dwight
49261,"Ugh. Same old party, same old people. Am I right? Reminds me of Phyllis's birthday.",dwight
49262,"Ooh, do not remind me of Phyllis's birthday.",andy
49263,"I know. [laughs] But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.",dwight
49264,Mmm.,andy
49265,"So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin.",dwight
49266,"Last I checked, I'm with Jessica. And I like to get my monog on. It's monogamy for my hog 'n me.",andy
49267,Not what I asked.,dwight
49268,We're done. Erin and I are over.,andy
49269,"So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex.",dwight
49270,Have at it. Or take it slow. Whatever you guys work out.,andy
49271,[sighs] You're an idiot.,dwight
49277,[Erin swims up with ring] Wow.,andy
49279,Yeah. Oh wow. How did you know it was mine?,andy
49281,Duh.,andy
49283,"Oh, whoa. Whoa, no, it's not a special night.",andy
49285,"Honestly Erin, I don't know what I'm doing. I... I just... I don't know. Thank you.",andy
49288,To madness.,jim
49292,"Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?",jim
49294,Are you serious?,jim
49301,And there's my talking point.,jim
49311,Uh huh.,dwight
49313,Yeah....baby.,dwight
49315,Hey.,andy
49317,"Yeah, it sounds like it.",andy
49318,"Hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis?",dwight
49320,"No, seriously. Your spine is jacked. It's like the devil's cursive.",dwight
49322,You'd be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out...[pushes Erin back to floor],dwight
49325,"[Erin helps Dwight stretch his inner thighs] Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oooooh, yeah.",dwight
49327,Bring it on guys.,andy
49328,Yeah...,dwight
49329,Let's go before I vomit. [Erin and Dwight enter pool],andy
49330,Ready?,dwight
49333,Alright! Here we go.,andy
49335,RAHHH!!!!!!!,dwight
49337,Get her! Ruin her! [Andy and Jessica beat Dwight and Erin],dwight
49338,Hey! High-five!,andy
49344,To the shame room! [raises bottle],jim
49348,"Val, I need the space.",andy
49350,Everybody out.,andy
49352,I can't promise what I'm going to do or not do.,andy
49354,Obviously I'm going to clean up.,andy
49355,"Stress is like the uptight mayor or a town who's saying, 'Hey, we're uptight, you can't dance,' and then you have to be like, 'Oh yeah, Mayor Stress? Well watch this!' And then... we dance. Oh how we dance. [dances to Kenny Loggin's Footloose] Sex also works.",andy
49357,Hey! Tuna! He's back.,andy
49358,Hey.,jim
49359,"Oh, look at this. [hugs Jim] Tuna wrap.",andy
49360,Okay.,jim
49361,[grabs Jim's wrist] Hand roll.,andy
49362,Yeah.,jim
49364,"It was pretty uneventful, actually.",jim
49365,Can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.,dwight
49367,"Uh, hit and run.",jim
49370,Nope. Not guilty.,jim
49371,"Of course you found him not guilty. [mocking voice] 'Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm.'",dwight
49372,"We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.",jim
49373,"Not coming, have plans.",dwight
49374,Okay.,jim
49375,"I did get called in to jury duty. And they released me around noon, so, didn't think it was worth it to come back to work for a half day. And then the next morning Pam was a little overwhelmed with the kids so I took an extra day to help out. And then three other days happened.",jim
49388,"Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work.",jim
49395,"Come on, Judge Judy, tell us your case. What were the deets?",andy
49396,"Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-",jim
49400,"Wow, I'm really sorry.",jim
49402,I never considered that my week off would make everyone else's job harder. The least I could do is give them a good story.,jim
49403,"[demonstrating with napkin holder and salt shaker] So Phyllis, he was here, and then the car came and did- he was like that. Yeah, so it had to be a double backflip, actually.",jim
49405,"Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too.",jim
49408,"I was in Los Angeles last year. Jim tricked me into thinking I'd won a walk-on part on NCIS, but that's not important. While I was being kicked off the lot, I saw food trucks everywhere. Everyone in Los Angeles eats from them. And nobody calls them restaurants.",dwight
49424,"So this whole hit and run thing, there's just one part I can't figure out. You said it was at a four-way stop...",dwight
49425,Mm-hmm.,jim
49426,And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?,dwight
49427,Mm-hmm.,jim
49428,"See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle. [villainous laugh] Busted, Halpert!",dwight
49429,"Okay, wait, wait.",jim
49430,"Yes! Andy, get out here.",dwight
49431,No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.,jim
49432,I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights.,dwight
49433,"What's up, gangstas?",andy
49434,Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him!,dwight
49435,"Dwight, not everything is a conspiracy theory.",andy
49436,I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-,dwight
49437,"No. Dwight! I have me on the record, saying to you, take a chill pill.",andy
49438,I don't- I don't need to take a chill pill.,dwight
49439,"Here, right there. [mimes giving Dwight a pill and a glass] Down the hatch.",andy
49440,I really don't want to take the chill pill. [mimes taking pill],dwight
49441,"Attaboy. Good. Now, chill.",andy
49442,"Okay, okay. [sits, exhales] But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?",dwight
49443,"Yeah, sure, of course. I'd fire him to Timbuktu. [Jim laughs nervously]",andy
49444,That's good enough for me. [exhales again],dwight
49445,"...and Pam was just going crazy, trying to take care of Philip because Cece has been out of control recently, and- look, Andy, it doesn't matter. The truth is, I just feel terrible lying to you.",jim
49446,I feel terrible getting lied to. No one's ever lied to me before.,andy
49447,Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.,jim
49448,"No, not after what I told Dwight about firing you. No. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to have ourselves a good old-fashioned cover-up. Have you ever heard of a Connecticut cover-up?",andy
49449,No.,jim
49450,Do you know why you never heard of it?,andy
49451,No.,jim
49452,Covered it up.,andy
49453,Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?,jim
49454,They used to call me King Tut because I'm so good at keeping things under wraps.,andy
49455,"My nickname was actually King Butt, because I had a king-size butt.",andy
49457,"Okay, everybody, gather 'round. Got a real special surprise for you. [indicates Ernesto and assistant who are carrying empanadas]",dwight
49463,"Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?",dwight
49464,Uh-,jim
49466,The empanada guy!,jim
49467,"No, Toby! [bleep] Damn it, Toby! No, I wasn't asking you. [sighs] Ask him if he remembers Jim. [Nate asks Ernesto a question in Spanish]",dwight
49470,"He says, 'No!' Boom!",dwight
49471,"Yeah but who remembers all their customers? I mean, I can name like three of our clients.",andy
49472,"Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world. [Ernesto says something in Spanish]",dwight
49474,"Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.",jim
49476,"Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?",dwight
49477,Why? Everybody's heard it.,andy
49478,Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?,dwight
49479,"Hey, Murder She Wrote. How about we drop the whole 'Murder, She Wrote' thing, okay? Jim was at the courthouse for jury duty every morning. How do I know? Because I drove him there.",andy
49481,Why? Why? [looks at Jim],andy
49482,Because my car broke down.,jim
49483,"His car broke down. So he called me, 'cause I live near the courthouse.",andy
49484,"Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?",dwight
49485,"Thirty minutes out, thirty minutes back, easy hour. And I would watch that cute little tushie scurry up those courthouse stairs every morning and that was that.",andy
49487,We're getting buried out there. What was that stuff about the car breaking down?,andy
49488,"Well, I think you handled it pretty well.",jim
49489,"I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim. I can't keep spinning gold out of your [bleep].",andy
49490,"Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth.",jim
49491,[sighs] I don't even know what the truth is anymore.,andy
49507,"Uh, excuse me, can I have everyone's attention for a second? First off, I just want to say that I'm really sorry, I didn't know that my absence last week would have been a burden on any of you, because, though I did have jury duty last week, they did dismiss me early on Monday. And I think you're going to find this pretty hilarious. I kind of, uh, well, maybe took the week off.",jim
49509,Funny? No? Nobody laughing?,jim
49510,"[laughs] You're screwed! Oh, it's happening. It's really happening.",dwight
49512,"Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.",jim
49513,Your clients. They're all mine.,dwight
49515,"Uh, I did, every morning. And if I didn't, then I hope I die.",andy
49516,"All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand. [puts Jim's things in a box] Here we are. So long, clump-mate. I'm going to miss you. Truth be told, I never thought that this was how it was going to end. I always thought that I was going to defeat you somehow. But you've defeated yourself. [laughs]",dwight
49517,"Dwight, cut it out. I'm not firing Jim.",andy
49518,"No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-",dwight
49519,"I know what I said. Jim, you're in deep doo-doo. Do you understand? I have one thing to say to you, and I'm going to say it in front of this whole office. Look me in the eye. [gives Jim a limp slap]",andy
49520,That's it? This is crap! [dumps the box on Jim's desk and leaves],dwight
49522,"Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.",dwight
49523,"I'm gonna find Gabe, tell him what Jim did and let the little stickler do what he does best: stickle.",dwight
49540,"Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe?",dwight
49542,Okay. [sits],dwight
49544,Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.,dwight
49546,So don't.,dwight
49548,What?,dwight
49550,How long before?,dwight
49552,Yes I did.,dwight
49555,I want to see the baby.,dwight
49557,"Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions... [whispers] willingly, or as slaves.",dwight
49558,"That baby is a Schrute. And unless somebody taught Mose sex, that baby is mine.",dwight
49564,[to Cece] You want a giraffe?,jim
49565,"Yes, I am brining my kids in to help me get out of this hole. And you all remember my beautiful wife, Pam.",jim
49566,"Hi. Wow, I really thought I'd be more excited to be here.",pam
49567,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.",jim
49568,"Oh right, okay. Hey Stanley, it's great to see you!",pam
49569,"Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think.",jim
49570,"Oh, hi Stanley.",pam
49571,Split the difference?,jim
49572,Jim.,pam
49573,"Okay, let's go.",jim
49574,Hey.,pam
49576,Hi everybody!,pam
49577,What?,jim
49579,How about a little visit?,pam
49580,"Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.",jim
49582,"Yes, well, you guys all know Cece, but we wanted to introduce you to baby Philip.",pam
49583,"Aw! You guys. He's licking on my finger, just like my cat does.",andy
49585,"No, it's the pacifier's turn.",pam
49587,Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?,jim
49588,"[gasps] Yes! Cece wanted to thank everybody for letting her daddy stay home with her all last week and play, so she brought you a little treat.",pam
49590,"No, but that would've been a really good idea.",pam
49591,That was a great idea.,jim
49592,"No, she brought you drawings.",pam
49593,"Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.",jim
49594,Oh!,andy
49595,"Oh, Aunt Phyllis.",jim
49597,"Wow, these are incredible. Cece, did you do these?",andy
49599,"She says 'no' to everything. You know, she thinks my name is 'No.' Cece, do you want some broccoli?",pam
49601,No. It's crazy.,pam
49603,There's cross-hatching in some of these. That's kind of advanced for a two-year-old.,andy
49607,"Hey, Cece, why don't you draw another picture for us, exactly like this one, or at least in the exact same style?",andy
49608,"You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?",jim
49610,Shh.,pam
49611,I don't know what else we can do here.,jim
49613,It's okay.,jim
49614,"Oh, it's okay, sweetie.",pam
49615,"All right, all right. Okay.",jim
49616,"It's okay, honey. [Philip cries] It's okay, it's okay.",pam
49617,"All right, I know, I know. Let's just get this.",jim
49618,Shh.,pam
49620,"Angela, this child is definitely mine. He looks just like me.",dwight
49622,Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?,dwight
49624,Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.,dwight
49625,You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-,dwight
49627,"-and I said, 'I bet I could fulfill you,' and you said, 'I'd like to see you try,' and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.",dwight
49629,And then I inserted my penis-,dwight
49631,Into your-,dwight
49633,Vagina and-,dwight
49635,Admit that there is a chance.,dwight
49637,Admit it. Admit it.,dwight
49640,Yeah.,dwight
49643,"Before I go, may I?",dwight
49645,"Nurse, you know that baby in there, baby Philip? Cancel the circumcision.",dwight
49647,I just might be his father.,dwight
49649,"[Philip is crying] I know, buddy, I know. Cece, you want to come? Want to come out?",jim
49651,"Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?",jim
49652,"I'm looking, I'm looking for the pacifier.",pam
49653,Cece!,jim
49654,"Okay, we're going.",pam
49655,"Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we're going home, we're going home. We're going home, we're going home. I know, I know, bud.",jim
49656,"Shh, shh, shh.",pam
49657,"I know, I know.",jim
49658,You want to grab her?,pam
49659,"I'm gonna grab her, okay.",jim
49660,"Here we go, here we go.",pam
49661,"Hi, all right. I'm just going to go down to the car and I'm going to put her in her seat and I'll be right back up.",jim
49663,"No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back.",jim
49667,Jim.,pam
49669,"Hey, we'll be just fine.",andy
49670,"Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let's go.",jim
49671,"Oh, whew!",andy
49672,"Dwight, what the hell? You can't smoke in here.",andy
49673,"Oh, right. [sighs] The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe.",dwight
49675,"Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.",dwight
49676,"Jim? Oh, right. Nah, forget it. He was doing it for his kids. I get it. Kids drive us dads crazy. Sometimes I feel like they're raising us. Am I right?",dwight
49677,"I would love for everyone to just forgive me. But, if that's not happening, I'm not averse to just buying them all off.",jim
49678,"Alright guys. You know how we all like the red licorice but it's always buried behind like a ton of black licorice? [points to pile of candy] Bought it all. Now it's like red city in there. So, enjoy it.",jim
49680,So you effectively spent what...four dollars on the entire office?,andy
49681,"Uh, I can't get a handle on it. Am I cheap or rich? I can't...",jim
49682,You're nothing. When I think about all the gas money I spent on you. Washing my car to make sure you-,andy
49683,"[interrupting] Alright. Well, enjoy the red licorice, and good riddance, right? [tosses black licorice into trash]",jim
49685,"It's not really food, right?",jim
49687,"Ok, ok, ok.",jim
49689,'And shove it up my butt.',jim
49692,I'm not gonna eat it.,jim
49694,I'm not-,jim
49696,"[on phone] They hate me, Pam.",jim
49697,They don't hate you.,pam
49698,"No, it's bad. Darryl canceled go-karting....",jim
49699,When were you going go-karting with Darryl?,pam
49700,It's a lunch thing.,jim
49701,"Alright. Just don't worry, we'll figure this out.",pam
49702,I feel like a stranger in my own country.,jim
49703,"Ok, drama.",pam
49704,"Ok. Well, hey, you're not here. You don't know, Ok? It's intense. They made me eat black licorice.",jim
49705,"I have a recurring nightmare that I've been wrongly accused of a crime and twelve of these idiots are on the jury. Stanley is fast asleep, Kevin eats the evidence, Phyllis's name is Allison but it really is Phyllis, Jim is foreman of the jury and pronounces me guilty. The cop takes me away and tells me that I've been a bad boy and we have sex in the hall. She leaves the handcuffs on. They take me away to prison. The guards are all women. [sighs]",dwight
49706,"Everyone, this is Officer Foley from the Scranton PD. Works down at the courthouse. I think he has something he's like to say.",andy
49710,No.,andy
49714,That is so offensive and ridiculous. I-,andy
49718,"Ho hah!....oh, shoot.",andy
49720,Oh ho! Look who's back reporting for duty.,jim
49721,Hey guys!,pam
49723,[laughing] Hi.,pam
49724,Pam! Ahh! Look what I can do now that she's no longer pregnant. [pretends to punch Pam in the stomach] Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!,andy
49726,"Yeah. Yeah, I mean I could have used another week, or three.",pam
49728,"[laughing] Well, it's not exactly a vacation.",pam
49730,What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago.,dwight
49732,What?!,pam
49737,"Oh Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts. You're allergic to walnuts, right Kevin?",pam
49739,Aw. It's OK Angela. I have mommy brain too.,pam
49741,When did you find time to do all this?,pam
49743,Thank you. [takes bite] Oh my gosh. It's really good.,pam
49745,"So you guys, you know what's an even more useful treat...is cash. So-",pam
49746,Nope. It's over.,jim
49747,...we wanted to say thank you-,pam
49748,Nope. OK.,jim
49749,"Dwight, I have exciting news for you.",andy
49750,What?,dwight
49751,I think you're going to like it.,andy
49752,You can't tantalize me.,dwight
49753,"Oooh, maybe I can. [slowly] I got an email... from corporate....that told me that...",andy
49754,OK. [looks at watch and leaves],dwight
49755,That...[quickly] you got a promotion! [Dwight turns back] Right? I mean that's not the kinda thing you wanna read quietly at your desk.,andy
49756,"If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear.",dwight
49757,"No, this is legit. You will be assembling a team to go to Tallahassee for three weeks to develop and launch a chain of Sabre stores.",andy
49758,"Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!",dwight
49759,"The Shrutes have a word for when everything comes together in a man's life perfectly: Perfectinschlag. Hmm. Right now, I am in it. I finally get a chance to prove myself to corporate, I am assembling a competent team, I am likely a father, I am so deep inside of perfectinschlag right now. And just to be clear, there is a second definition, 'perfect pork anus' which I don't mean.",dwight
49761,And here's some facts for you. Did you know frogs can hear with their lungs? And that flamingos can have orgasms that last 30 minutes.,andy
49763,"Yeah, it's weird that I said that last one.",andy
49765,"Uh yeah, look at that.",andy
49767,"Pin twins! This is a gift from Jessica, kind of a gag gift really. Real gifts come later.",andy
49772,"Pam, pack up your post-natal swimwear, make it a one piece or this offer is rescinded, and join me on a fantastic barbeque one week from today in Tallahassee, Florida where I'm going to be living for the next three weeks.",dwight
49773,Really?,pam
49774,Mm hm.,dwight
49775,I'll fly anywhere for some good barbeque.,pam
49776,"Ooh, me three.",jim
49777,"Eh! No plus one's. This is for competent workers only. And don't worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill.",dwight
49778,Does this have anything to do with what you were talking to Andy about?,pam
49779,"God, you're such a spy.",dwight
49801,"My first task as special project manager Dwight Shrute? Assembling a crack team. I need people who are loyal. People who'll help me get an inroad with the gay Hispanic community. People who won't be missed. We don't need idiots, good for nothing's, methheads or... What's your name?",dwight
49803,Kathy.,dwight
49804,I just got a text from Robert California that says 'bring your clubs to Florida'.,jim
49805,Why? Does he think you're going to Florida?,pam
49806,I hope not. [laughs] Because I am not going. Two question marks?,jim
49807,"No, just do one. Two question marks is kind of aggressive. You know it's like wha-what?? Just do one.",pam
49808,"You wanna take Darryl, Phyllis, Toby, Angela and Oscar?",andy
49809,Yes.,dwight
49810,Can I interest you in someone less essential? Like uh a Creed or a Meredith perhaps?,andy
49811,Oh my god.,dwight
49812,"They're not expendable exactly, I just can't...I can't think of the word I'm trying to find.",andy
49813,Are you kidding me?! I'm supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We'd never get off the runway.,dwight
49814,"Alright, look. I gotta keep this office functioning somehow. So, I have put together a list, here's your team. Darryl and Phyllis you can have, but you're also taking Kathy, Kelly and Kevin.",andy
49815,Oh god.,dwight
49816,You have your team.,andy
49817,Kevin!? Kelly!? Kathy!? Andy just gave me a chain with three weak links. Have you ever tried to use a chain with three weak links? I have. And now I no longer own an arctic wolf.,dwight
49818,"Well, let's hear it.",pam
49819,"'Robert, Hey!' Exclamation point.",jim
49820,I like it so far.,pam
49821,"'Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA' Dash JH.",jim
49822,"It's perfect. You emphasized the golf, completely omit the Florida.",pam
49823,"Yeah, it's a golf text.",jim
49824,Total golf text. Send it.,pam
49825,Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.,jim
49836,"May I have your attention please? Could Kathy, Darryl, Phyllis, Kevin and Kelly please join me in the conference room immediately?",dwight
49838,"Oh, no big deal. It's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida.",dwight
49841,"Oh, I'm sorry Stanley, I can't share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you.",dwight
49844,"I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons.",dwight
49846,"I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.",dwight
49848,"Good point. But we're gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan.",dwight
49850,"It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out. [knocks on Andy's office door] Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you.",dwight
49851,Mooshie mooshie. [Dwight laughs],andy
49852,"Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify?",dwight
49853,Well uh...well the deliberations were confidential so...I feel like we should respect that.,andy
49859,Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby.,dwight
49860,"Guys. Guys. Guys. Come on, seriously? We cannot let this trip cause this kind of rift, guys!",andy
49862,I use the word 'guys' a lot when I'm nervous...guys.,andy
49863,Guys! Guys! Guys!,andy
49865,Guys..,andy
49868,Dudes...the dudes who are going to Florida were picked by Dwight and me.,andy
49869,OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.,dwight
49870,Wha-,andy
49872,"OK, I did not realize that so many of you wanted to go so badly, so if you feel like you have a very good reason to go to Florida, I'm happy to hear you out.",andy
49873,"Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it.",dwight
49874,No. That is a ridiculous waste of time.,andy
49876,Five to six hours?,andy
49877,Three to four hours.,dwight
49878,No no no no.,andy
49879,Two to three hours...,dwight
49880,Nope.,andy
49881,Come up with a statement in the next hour....,dwight
49882,Thirty minutes!,andy
49884,"Ok, read it back to me.",pam
49885,"[reading text] Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.",jim
49886,Good. Doesn't sound pushy...you're just stating a fact.,pam
49888,"Ok, sending.",jim
49889,Well done. And we managed to kill the entire morning.,pam
49890,Really did [Text bleep] He responded L-O-L.,jim
49894,"I have already picked my team: Darryl, Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby and that is the team that I am taking. What's that? It's not up to me? I only have influence? Well, that's all Baltzer Gladfielder had and no one eats owls for Thanksgiving.",dwight
49896,Or both?,andy
49898,Very impressive. He put a lot of work into that.,andy
49899,"Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat.",dwight
49901,"Ok. Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know.",dwight
49902,Thank you.,andy
49904,Thank you.,andy
49906,"Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, AKA: sad. That sounds like a very real thing, Toby.",dwight
49908,"Yeah, wow. It's almost like we're not all experiencing the same winter?",andy
49910,Maybe it's what she does here...,dwight
49911,Well...,andy
49913,"Erin, you wanna go to Tallahassee?",andy
49915,You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.,dwight
49917,Well it wouldn't be hard to find someone to fill in..,andy
49919,"Now, is it too dark to say that Cici's having an operation?",jim
49920,I think you need to go to Florida.,pam
49921,I think you're right.,jim
49922,"It's only for three weeks, you know with my mom and sister at the house it'll be..",pam
49923,Total nightmare.,jim
49924,I was going to say good because I'll have all the help I need?,pam
49925,"Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone.",jim
49926,Exactly.,pam
49927,"Well, [Jim enters] No! No! Absolutely not! You are not going. Over my dead body, no. Andy?",dwight
49928,"Tuns, I'm really sorry. You're too essential to the operation here, I can't let you go.",andy
49929,I wouldn't say that...it's a bit much.,dwight
49930,"You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go.",jim
49931,Jim is essential to th-,dwight
49932,"Hold on, just wanna get it on camera. [holds up cellphone]",jim
49933,"Andy, Jim is just too...essen-...",dwight
49934,Essential.,jim
49935,This is stupid! Cut.,dwight
49936,"Alright, I'm gonna pack my trunks.",jim
49937,He doesn't even want to go.,dwight
49938,"Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates.",jim
49939,Oh my god.,dwight
49940,"Hey, quick question: Do you shower at night or in the morning? Cause I wanna shower when you're showering. Save some water.",jim
49941,"OK, listen up everyone, here's who's going to Florida: Kathy..",andy

49949,"...And, Jim.",andy
49950,"You've gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team. [goes into conference room and slams door] AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!",dwight
49951,"Let's go, step it up you runts. You infants, let's move.",dwight
49953,"Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead.",dwight
49955,"But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?",dwight
49957,"Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell. [holds up Taboo buzzer]",dwight
49958,Is that the buzzer from Taboo?,jim
49959,"SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.",dwight
49960,How many of you have seen the documentary Deliverance?,dwight
49962,"I released three hundred mosquitoes in the conference room, just temporarily. When I'm done, the frogs will take care of the mosquitoes. [Frog in plastic cage ribbits]",dwight
49963,"Yes, when he brushes your soft supple cheeks with his worn leathery hands and says 'I'm gonna make you the seventh Mrs. Rosenblatt' unless you ring this bell. Ring it! Ring the bell. You wanna spend the rest of your life changing your husband's colostomy bags? Huh? Do you? Ring it! Wha-, [Jim slaps Dwight's forehead] oh. What was that?",dwight
49964,Mosquito.,jim
49965,[Sighs and grunts] Orientation is over.,dwight
49982,"Ok, Florida team, let's reconvene.",dwight
49984,So Sabre has set up a conference room for our use while we're at corporate.,dwight
49985,"So, what is this special project?",jim
49986,Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.,dwight
49987,That sounds awesome.,jim
49988,"It did, it did.",dwight
49991,"Oh, I like it.",dwight
49993,No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.,dwight

50039,"Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, 'For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?' and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?",jim

50196,"What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is.",dwight
50198,"Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is... [sighs] The only thing you need to know about retail consumer habits is that consumers are mindless lemmings. They just want to be told what to do. [Erin makes the first slide appear] Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.",dwight
50199,Shopping habits are both seasonal and cyclical. What does this mean?,dwight
50201,"No, sit down. 'Seasonal.' Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point.

50209,Burgers.,dwight
50211,"Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only one: desire. Do we have a desire to dominate the retail space? Not just succeed in it, but to dominate, and looking around this room I'm not so sure that we do, but we can get there, and I can lead us there, and that is all that matters.",dwight
50213,Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim?,dwight
50214,You are bleeding through your shirt.,jim

50857,Yeah. That was him on the phone. He sounds wonderful.,andy
50859,How could I have been more clear? He had a massive stroke [slight pause] of good fortune and he is now in a better place.,andy
50863,I think that Dwight wanted us to realize that this conversation among friends is the true treasure. [everyone disagrees],andy

50979,Robert doesn't talk like that. You have to stop Dwight from doing this.,pam
50980,I tried. He will not listen.,jim
50981,Did you actually try your hardest?,pam

51237,"Andy, where are you?",jim
51238,"I- I'm home in bed. I've been in bed all day. I got the-- I got the serious poops, man.",andy
51240,"What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job.",jim
51241,"What do you mean, take my job?",andy
51242,"Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.",jim
51243,"Okay... Jim, I really appreciate you looking out for me, but I'm not coming home without Erin. So I'll talk to you later.",andy
51244,"Guys, we cannot do these performance reviews, okay? If we go into them, you're basically accepting Nellie as your manager, and trust me, you do not want her as your manager.",jim
51246,I like working here.,pam
51247,"Dwight, should she be our manager?",jim
51248,I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.,dwight
51249,"Those who can't farm, farm celery.",dwight
51250,And when was the last time Dwight and I agreed on anything ever? [clears throat],jim
51254,"I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.",dwight
51256,What?,dwight
51258,There's no limit to what I think I deserve.,dwight
51260,Five percent. No less.,dwight
51262,"Six percent, I know my worth.",dwight
51263,The raise isn't real.,jim
51264,Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard.,dwight
51266,Phyllis.,pam
51271,Um... are you aware that Nellie is giving out raises?,jim
51273,"Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis.",jim
51275,"Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry.",jim
51277,Yes.,jim
51279,"Oh, god, nature, please.",jim
51281,[exhales sharply],jim
51283,Was that not the--,jim
51285,Mm-hm.,jim
51287,"Was that it? No, that wasn't bad.",jim
51289,No. I would've said no.,jim
51292,"I mean, if we go in there and take these raises, what are we saying? That it's okay for someone to just take someone else's job? Shouldn't work like that.",jim
51293,"No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.",dwight
51295,Yes.,dwight
51297,Yes.,dwight
51299,Yes.,dwight
51301,Yes.,dwight
51303,"Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off.",dwight
51304,"[Darryl grabbing him by his hair, dragging him from office] Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.",dwight
51305,[panting] Well fought. I accept the outcome.,dwight
51308,"Yeah, if I had my own--",andy
51310,"--sorry, you go.",andy
51312,"Well, I was just going to say that, if I had my own fountain, it would be two frogs that are spitting into each other's mouth. It's just stupid. What were you going to say?",andy
51314,You broke my heart too.,andy
51316,I'm so sorry that we have not loved each other at the same time.,andy
51318,[sighs],andy
51320,"Really? Okay, well, um, I like consistency in the manager's position, no weird silent coups. Stuff like that. I'm easy.",pam
51322,"Whoa, that's kind of condescending. Would you say something like that to Jim?",pam
51324,"Well, I mean, the only reason he doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding, and Phillip doesn't like a bottle.",pam
51326,No.,pam
51328,I think... you're a witch.,pam
51330,[drowsily] I'm amazing. [sighs],pam
51339,"No, it's not, because you don't really work here.",jim
51341,"Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises.",jim
51343,Yes.,jim
51345,No.,jim
51349,She dies.,jim
51351,Let's see it. Show of hands.,jim
51353,"All right, guys, stop.",jim
51355,How?,jim
51359,"That did not go how I wanted it to. Ugh. I have a whole ton of Erin's favorite food for the drive back, eggplant parm. [tosses it out car window] It's biodegradable. Animals will eat it.",andy
51361,Erin!,andy
51364,Okay.,andy
51366,"Wait, we have to go back and get your stuff.",andy
51368,Like your toothbrush and stuff.,andy
51370,You don't have a toothbrush?,andy
51372,How do you not have a toothbrush?,andy
51374,You just use whichever one is sitting there?,andy
51376,Of course. I own my toothbrush.,andy
51378,Hey Jim. Stanley's back from the hospital today. Can you sign his card?,pam
51379,"Oh, great. [reads] 'Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy.' Oh that's not good.",jim
51381,It's nice. It's funny. It mentions his tonsillectomy and makes a funny little joke about his moustache.,pam
51382,Stanley doesn't have a moustache.,jim
51383,Yeah he does.,pam
51385,"Okay, Phyllis sits across from him every day. Phyllis, does he have a moustache or not?",pam
51387,Phyllis! What are you talking- The whole card depends on this!,pam
51388,"Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?",jim
51390,"Okay, which one of these looks more right? [holds up drawing of Stanley with and without a moustache]",pam
51391,"Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left.",dwight
51393,"Okay, quick. Who says moustache? [Pam, Oscar, Dwight, and Creed raise their hands]",jim
51394,Yep.,dwight
51395,"Who says no moustache? [Jim, Angela, and Phyllis raise their hands; Gabe enters, hiding Stanley's face]",jim
51398,Yes!,dwight
51399,"Welcome back, Stanley. [Stanley grunts]",pam
51401,Oh! [takes out earbuds],pam
51403,"Um, no, I was just, um, just having a cup of coffee, kind of warming up for the day.",pam
51424,"Okay, okay.",dwight
51431,Why Jim?,dwight
51433,"I'm sorry, we're throwing a party for someone because they're being horrible?",pam
51434,"I'm sorry, we're taking work time to move someone's personal belongings into their new apartment.",jim
51435,I'm still not sure why this woman is even here.,pam
51436,Why is she here?,jim
51437,[sings] Two crazy kids on the journey of life.,andy
51439,"On the road with my new girlfriend. But first, a small pit stop to break up with my current girlfriend who is at her parents' cabin in southern Pennsylvania.",andy
51441,Mm-hmm. It's a beautiful place. Great place to let her down easy.,andy
51443,Oh. Hmm.,andy
51444,[sings] Time to have a little kiss!,andy
51446,Mm. Sorry. Right. No kisses till the breakup is official.,andy
51448,I believe in that.,andy
51450,"I think that's important. That is important. Bummer, but important.",andy
51452,Mm-hmm.,andy
51454,"I know, right?",pam
51459,Phyllis!,pam
51462,"...and Jessica, just so you know, this is way more about my love for Erin than anything wrong with you.",andy
51464,Consider it nailed.,andy
51466,"Okay, here we go. Jessica, I'm really sorry. I just need you to know-",andy
51468,I just need you to know-,andy
51470,[lifting box] Ugh! Ow.,dwight
51471,"Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door.",jim
51472,"Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? 'Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is.'",dwight
51473,That was one time-,jim
51474,I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.,dwight
51476,"[cell phone rings] Excuse me, one second. Hi.",jim
51477,"Hey, what's up?",pam
51478,"Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.",jim
51479,[shouting] Haulin' cube!,dwight
51480,That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.,jim
51481,"So we're planning this party for Nellie, and we're gonna make it really bad.",pam
51482,Sounds like every other party.,jim
51483,"No. We're gonna make it like a prank. Like order bad food, give her this passive-aggressive card.",pam
51484,Oh! Hire a magician.,jim
51485,What?,pam
51486,Trust me.,jim
51487,[laughs] Okay.,pam
51488,Wow. There's a lot of cars here. This is just weird.,andy
51490,"Hey, Lauren. Look at you.",andy
51492,"I was just on my way back from this business trip, thought I'd stop and say hi to Jessica.",andy
51494,"Why is Erin with me? That's a great question. She is my coworker, and she needed a ride because she totaled her car.",andy
51497,Yep. This is Erin.,andy
51500,"Yeah. Uh, you know, we had such a quick window to make this work, I think we should probably just-",andy
51503,I wonder if king-sized sheets are called presidential-sized in England. I really should have a Tweeter account.,dwight
51504,"Yes, you should.",jim
51505,[finds shoe box] Ooh.,dwight
51506,"[reads] 'Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie.'",jim
51507,I have to see these shoes.,dwight
51508,I doubt that they're sh-,jim
51509,Oh!,dwight
51510,Whoa. Who is this guy?,jim
51511,Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend.,dwight
51512,Boyfriend.,jim
51513,Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend.,dwight
51514,Like a boyfriend?,jim
51515,You read my mind.,dwight
51516,Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.,jim
51517,Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician.,dwight
51518,Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.,jim
51520,"Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just...",jim
51522,Why not call...,dwight
51523,Shh!,jim
51525,That's awful. What kind of restaurant.,dwight
51526,Dwight!,jim
51528,I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.,jim
51529,"If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.",dwight
51531,"No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or...",jim
51533,"[in the phone] You know what, Pam? I was thinking maybe we should change course here. Let's give up on all this mean stuff.",jim
51534,"What? No! No, I just had this brilliant idea- everyone loved it. You don't have a copyright on pranks. I might be better at this than you.",pam
51535,"No, that's not what I-",jim
51537,"Absolutely. Yeah. [whispers] Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.",jim
51538,"Oh, okay. Okay, I will. [hangs up phone]",pam
51542,Or what if...,pam
51544,"We discuss... [Angela and Phyllis giggle] the idea of doing the party totally normal. Like, not mean. Just a regular party. [giggling stops] Not mean.",pam
51547,What are you talking about? Yes we can.,pam
51552,It'll be fine. Just act natural. Do you want a gummy penis?,andy
51554,These are delicious.,andy
51557,"Ew! Aww! That seems gross at first blush, right? But relationships are always more complicated than you think. I mean, we don't know Matthew's history with this other woman. Maybe she saved his life. [laughs] I don't know.  I just- I don't think we should rush to judgment about Matthew. Maybe we don't pop that one.",andy
51560,Hey.,andy
51563,"Oh! Ah, Megan.",andy
51565,Aww.,andy
51568,"Oh, he's out there.",andy
51570,"Well, you guys are doing a pretty good job with the scary yelling, so...",andy
51572,[singing] By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes...,andy
51573,"Okay, they're almost here- What? Come on. If you guys are gonna be mean, could you at least be subtle? [rips down ugly photo of Nellie]",pam
51578,"No, that's a great idea. Let's have a code name. How about Mondays? I hate Mondays? Mondays are the worst?",pam
51581,Cause there's someone already here named Pam.,pam
51588,"No. I gotta do this. Hey Jessica, could I talk to you?",andy
51590,"Uh, maybe we could talk in private?",andy
51592,"Well, first just let me say that I hope when I'm done with the sort of ugly bits that we can stay friends.",andy
51594,"Uh, no. No. You always do this. You twist my words around. Part of me thinks we should just end this right now.",andy
51596,Whoa! That? No. Okay. You want honesty? Super-honesty time. I'm gay.,andy
51598,"I am gay, and I prefer men.",andy
51600,"You did not, Kenny!",andy
51602,I like hanging out with you. You're a cool guy. Which proves my point. That I'm gay.,andy
51604,"Well, I was faking it. I had to fake it every time. I had to imagine that I was in a steam room with John Stamos.",andy
51606,"Well... I mean, I was good at hiding it, but-",andy
51608,"Understandable. And I'm really sorry. I really am. [hugs Jessica, grunts] So... we should probably... go.",andy
51616,"Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.",jim
51620,No. No.,jim
51622,"Oh! [laughter, murmuring]",pam
51624,Right? Rough scene.,andy
51626,Oh... at least we can kiss now.,andy
51628,"You know, that stuff that I said about you to her... I did- That's just- I had to say it. You know, I was dating her at the time.",andy
51630,Yeah.,andy
51632,Oh yeah.,andy
51635,"Oh, I'll do it. I will volunteer.",jim
51637,I'll do it.,jim
51639,[picks a card] It's the four of hearts.,jim
51644,Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place.,jim
51646,"That's not a real knot. When you pull on it, it disappears.",pam
51648,"Okay scram, wizard.",dwight
51650,You heard me!,dwight
51657,"I just gotta do one thing. [leaves car, knocks on door]",andy
51660,"Hi. Super-duper honesty time. I'm not gay. In fact, I'm so not gay, I'm in love with a girl. Her name is Erin Hannon and she's right there. She's sweet, funny and beautiful and total relationship material.",andy
51665,Okay.,andy
51667,Bye guys.,andy
51675,Hey Hank.,pam
51677,I thought I was very specific about you not letting up a magician.,pam
51679,"Well, turns out he actually made it up there.",jim
51681,"Yeah, he came and went.",pam
51683,Let's just- let's go.,pam
51684,Night-night.,jim
51686,"Phyllis says the same twelve clich??s every time it rains. So, I promised everyone that if she says them all by noon today, I will send out for hot chocolates.",jim
51696,"Just one. 'This weather makes me want to stay at home, curled up with a good book.'",pam
51699,"You know, like aren't some things just so nice and cozy in the rain?",pam
51700,"Hey, come on.",jim
51702,And that's noon. Exactly. [others groan],jim
51704,[singing] My girlfriend's back and there's gonna be trouble-,andy
51706,...my girlfriend's back!,andy
51708,"Anyway, I know it's the end of the day. We just wanted to stop by and say hi.",andy
51711,"Hey, Kev.",andy
51713,Nice sweater.,andy
51715,What happened to old salty?,andy
51716,Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.,dwight
51717,"I've written quite a bit of X-Men fan fiction. Captain Mutato is half man, half mermaid. So he can fight crime as a man and make love as a mermaid. Most of my writing involves the latter.",dwight
51718,Okey dokey. [knocks on door],andy
51720,"Whoa. Well, you must be the famous Nellie Bertram I've been hearing all about. I am the famous Andy Bernard you've been hearing all about.",andy
51722,I just want to thank you for jumping in and minding the store during my temporary absence.,andy
51724,"Anyway, now that I'm back, I would love to have my office back, whenever you get a chance.",andy
51726,"Obviously, we'll figure out the, uh, logistics of moving all this stuff out of here. But, you know, the sooner the better.",andy
51728,Get back to normalcy.,andy
51731,"Oh my gosh, thank you so much. But seriously, we don't want to bother you any more than we already have.",pam
51732,That's it.,jim
51734,"Ravi, our amazing pediatrician, was asking us if we knew any girls and I said I know the perfect girl.",pam
51735,"Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, that's it.",jim
51736,Race had nothing to do with it. I just knew they'd be good together.,pam
51737,[talks over flashbacks] Kelly has been a handful in the past.,pam
51739,[Ryan and Kelly make out in the nook] But she's had a bad influence. She's like an addict. [Ryan and Kelly argue] And I just had to get her clean.,pam
51742,"Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby.",jim
51744,Don't shake our baby?,pam
51746,"Okay. I'd never heard that before. So, thank you.",pam
51748,"Yeah, I'm glad you said something.",pam
51752,"Yeah, they're really great together.",pam
51754,"That's about it, yeah.",jim
51758,This is what I was trying to tell you.,andy
51764,[chuckling] Okay.,andy
51766,You can't dock my pay-,andy
51769,"Great. Five, four, three, two, one. Angela, please dock Nellie's pay a hundred dollars. Angela?",andy
51771,Angela?,andy
51773,"Ooh, she's counting again.",andy
51775,"Oh, oh!",andy
51778,"Seriously, Angela?",andy
51779,I got a little bit of an anger problem. Got me in some trouble a couple years ago.,andy
51782,You're just saying numbers. It's meaningless.,andy
51784,It's literally like-,andy
51788,"Oh, yeah, I was just tired.",andy
51790,"Whoa. No. Are you kidding? You were so sexy. Just the thought of you last night, like, crazy turns me on. It just didn't last night.",andy
51792,Yeah. I know it's not... a big deal.,andy
51800,Yes?,dwight
51802,How?,dwight
51804,"Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never.",dwight
51806,Okay?,dwight
51808,Washington Monument.,dwight
51810,Eiffel Tower.,dwight
51812,I saw you were getting along with Ryan again.,pam
51814,"Yeah, he's so great. Remember how it felt when he cheated on you though?",pam
51816,"I am not going to let Kelly throw her life away on Ryan. And it has nothing to do with access to my pediatrician. Why you would even ask or were going to ask, because I- I felt like that question was coming.",pam
51817,One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller. So there's that. Gabe bragged about having an extra ticket to the air show this weekend and Meredith said she was interested and then Gabe said immediately that his friend might be taking the ticket. So I'll keep you posted on that.,dwight
51818,Every day I brief Nellie on what's going on in the office. Most of it's irrelevant. But a good informer doesn't judge what's worth passing on.,dwight
51819,"Oh, and Andy lost his masculinity, so congratulations on that.",dwight
51821,"Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant.",dwight
51824,You can't call a meeting. [laughs] But I would like to have a meeting in the conference room right now! So let's get in the conference room. Thank you. Good. Thank you for coming to my meeting.,andy
51826,Oh! Can't do it 'cause I gotta run a meeting. So.,andy
51828,Wanted to talk to all of you guys about [reads whiteboard] importance... and know that each and every one of you is vitally important.,andy
51833,"It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.",dwight
51843,"No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now. [thrusts his pelvis]",dwight
51847,"Fine, it was me. I couldn't- I had a problem with Erin last night. Happy?",andy
51848,I had a lot on my mind last night. And I didn't perform. Okay? It happens to plenty of guys. It's usually not followed by a giant workplace discussion and an interview.,andy
51849,Every guy in this room has been touched by this affliction. Tuna? T-dog?,andy
51850,Um...,jim
51853,Fascinating.,andy
51861,"Okay, so I-",andy
51862,"Actually Andy, I think maybe we experienced it.",pam
51863,What happened?,jim
51864,That a couple of times-,pam
51865,Couple of times.,jim
51867,Yeah Jim.,dwight
51868,"Yeah Jim, get it out there.",andy
51869,"Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had sex so many times already, I was exhausted...",jim
51870,"Okay, stop.",pam
51871,I was very drunk.,jim
51879,"You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it.",dwight
51882,"Wow, what are we talking about?",jim
51887,"[on the phone] Dad, don't think of it as a demotion. Just think of it as a promotion to a lower level. I don't think you have to tell your friends anything. It hasn't been decided yet.",andy
51890,"Oh, and another thing! Our sex life is none of your businesses!",andy
51892,"Stop protecting me! I'm a man- I can protect myself! This is misdirected anger and I'm sorry! I don't mean to lash out at you! There's a lot coming up right now, all at once! [into phone] Dad go to hell, I'm taller than you!",andy
51894,You are not the manager. I earned that job. I was personally chosen after Robert was chosen and quit.,andy
51896,"Why don't you take a seat, you idiot? [throws chair]",andy
51898,And your stupid face! [grabs Nellie's photo off the wall and smashes it on the ground] And your stupid office! [punches hole in the wall] Ah!,andy
51901,That would actually be cool. I'd love for you to meet some of the guys.,andy
51904,All I did was remind her that you used to treat her badly.,pam
51906,"Fair enough. Um... I don't think you're a very good person. And forgive me, but I feel like I've said this to you before: I don't like you very much.",pam
51913,"Oh, no, no, no.",pam
51915,"Read it, please. I love amazing poetry.",pam
51917,Read through the pain. Be strong.,pam

51931,Boo!,pam

51936,"Barf! Ugh, you suck!",pam
51952,"Well, it's good to see Kelly's maturing.",jim
51955,No.,andy
51957,[British accent] No.,andy
51959,No.,andy
51961,No.,andy

51964,"Ah- da, da, da, da. I got it.",andy
51966,I... Got... It.,andy
51968,Yes.,andy
51969,You're not the least bit curious to hear a poem straight from Ryan's soul?,pam

52639,Really?,dwight
52640,"This is getting more and more delicious by the minute. [gargles alcohol, chokes, coughs] It's go time.",andy
52641,"Hey Nellie, I made soup - I made you some soup.",andy
52643,But it's really good- [drops soup] Oh!,andy
52646,A delicious moment.,andy
52648,"Well, but it-",andy
52650,"Okay, here we go. Oh, you know what? I don't want to throw a wrench in the works, but I want everything to be perfect and the baby's fingernails are just bothering me-",dwight
52653,"Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?",dwight
52658,"He defecated, aw.",dwight
52679,Is this what you were looking for? Huh? Huh?,dwight
52682,I just want you guys not to worry. 'Cause old Andy's gonna be just fine.,andy
52683,"No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk...",jim
52686,You hit her?,pam
52687,No. That is not the deal. Calibrate.,andy
52689,"That's not true either! That's also total- Everyone, please relax. I think you're gonna like this surprise guest.",andy
52693,[his phone rings] Huh? Hold on.,andy
52695,"I just gonna- quick- [answers phone] Hello? Hey, what's the scoop? Are you close? What? No. no, no, no, no, no. You have to come now. Traffic clears? No, next Friday... that's not gonna work. Okay. Yeah. Okay. [inhales, hangs up] Damn it! Well, this is not going to be quite as delicious as I wanted, but I do have a very tasty announcement for you guys. Not only am I not a lowly janitor, I am the regional manager once again! Guys, I got my old job back!",andy
52696,Oh boy.,jim
52697,"Oh, Andy.",pam
52699,I'm not crazy. I convinced David Wallace to give me my job back.,andy
52701,"Okay, yes, I see the confusion. I saw David at the fundraiser. He is now a multi-millionaire because he sold his toy vacuum 'Suck It' to the U.S. military.",andy
52702,"Andy, come on.",jim
52704,"I- I- Okay, I get how that sounds crazy.",andy
52706,Stop saying my name.,andy
52708,"Thank you, Erin.",andy
52710,But have you ever actually seen him yourself?,pam
52712,"Erin, come- Come on. You know I've been talking to David Wallace.",andy
52714,[into phone] Operation Phoenix is a go. Just get the car ready.,dwight
52718,"Yeah, I know.",andy
52720,Hey.,jim
52723,"David, what are you doing here?",pam
52726,What? Thought I heard my name. What? I'm the new manager?,andy
52728,But it's- it is- it is me? Right?,andy
52730,What?,andy
52732,Oh my God!,andy
52734,Wow. From janitor to manager?,andy
52736,That's quite a Cinderella story. From M-O-P to M-V-P.,andy
52738,"From total loss to total boss, I mean-",andy
52741,I was so looking forward to that and it did not... go as I thought it would.,andy
52753,Guess I'd better take off these dirty rags. Figure out how to be a manager of this place.,andy
52754,Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.,jim
52755,"Gosh, I hope so.",andy
52764,Looks like I might get my delicious moment after all.,andy
52766,It would be rude of me not to let you say whatever's on your mind.,andy
52768,No.,andy
52770,Do not bring Shakespeare into this. How dare you play the bard card?,andy
52772,I just want one mother[bleep] delicious moment. Is that too much to ask?,andy
52773,If I were to hire you back. If. What do you think you would do well?,andy
52775,"All right, you sly bastard. When can you start?",andy
52782,Gymnasts? You're going to seek out uneducated gymnasts?,andy
52784,"Mm. Mm-hmm. [they hug, Robert kisses him on the lips]",andy
52786,Hello.,dwight
52788,They're testing it now.,dwight
52790,Seventy-two hours.,dwight
52792,Yes. [Angela sits and holds his hand],dwight
52800,"How was my summer? It was pretty mixed. I invented a new power drink made out of beet runoff. Mmm, mmm! So that's really good. But I got some disappointing medical news.",dwight
52806,"For us, um, nothing new, really the kids are great.",pam
52807,You are really good at modesty. She's a genius.  She painted this incredible mural in the kids' room. There's a hippo leading a parade of 500 children',jim
52808,"Kay, well, you had that interesting thing.",pam
52809,"Oh, yeah",jim
52810,"Yes, Jim's friend is starting anew company based on this idea Jim had when they were back in college.",pam
52811,Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.,jim
52812,And he wanted Jim to be a part of it too.,pam
52813,"In Philly, so, that doesn't really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.",jim
52814,He said if it takes off he's gonna buy us a new car.,pam
52815,An Altima or better.,jim
52823,And that was our summer.,pam
52824,we good?,jim
52826,"Don't you guys have everything. I mean, its just a paper company.",pam
52828,"Oh, yeah, because we were kind of dramatic in the beginning. Well I don't think anything's gonna change in our lives now. With work and two kids there's just-nothing interesting is going to happen for us in a long, long time.",pam
52840,"No, Pete is not the new Jim. The only we have in common is that neither of us wants to sit on Meredith's face.  And if that  makes him the new Jim, then every human being in the world is the new Jim.",jim
52842,"Hey! Wow, I thought about this place a lot when I was on solo. Three days on a mountain, it'll change you. The things we think we need. Clocks, yeah right!",andy
52844,What're you still doing here?,andy
52846,You know I had this really funny dream during Outward Bound that you died.,andy
52848,"See me in my office later. The new guys, alright. It's Clark and, um'",andy
52850,In Outward Bound it was all about nicknames. They called me Iceman. You will be called Plop.,andy
52852,Cause you're always taking dumps.,andy
52854,"Come on, everybody defecates. Relax, Plop. And you will be called Fart cause you fart all the time.",andy
52858,"No, Dwight Jr. Infinitely better. You guys look exactly alike. Dwight go stand next to him. This is insane.",andy
52859,I don't see it.,dwight
52861,"Whoa! Mind blown. It's like father and son! Dwight, you cool if we call him Dwight Jr?",andy
52862,"Yes, yes I am. [puts his arm around Clark]",dwight
52863,"Dwight, Jr! [Dwight gives Clark a noogie]",andy
52864,In a way it's like I have a son. And who knows? Maybe someday they'll hire someone who looks like a younger version of him. And then I'll have a grandson.,dwight
52876,"David, outward bound was incredible. I was the best at slack lining, I ate a worm.",andy
52879,"Yeah, I gotta go David. [hangs up phone] Why is Nellie still here?",andy
52881,"Mm, then I will make up a cause.",andy
52883,Then forget I just told you that.,andy
52885,Now I know why Michael hated you so much.,andy
52886,"Good boy, getting big and strong. Snack foods!",dwight
52888,"Ah, humor. I have it too. I have a couple tickets to the slayer concert 10 months from now. You interested?",dwight
52890,"Well, we're both just kinda learning as we go, aren't we?",dwight
52892,"Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head.",dwight
52894,"So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man?",dwight
52896,Spoken like a true root man.,dwight
52898,My calls?,dwight
52900,You want a list of my clients? You want my leads?,dwight
52902,Ok,dwight
52904,With my leads and stuff like that?,dwight
52906,Cause you're interested in going into sales?,dwight
52908,"Wow, that's great. That's great. Ok, good, let's talk about that, ok?",dwight
52910,You're not getting my clients! Nice try.,dwight
52911,"Paranoid? I'm not familiar with the word. And I really don't have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.",dwight
52912,"Jim, get ready for the battle of your life.",dwight
52913,Done. Explain.,jim
52914,The new guys. Dwight Jr is after  my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub.,dwight
52915,"Oh, now I get what Pete was talking about at the sales meeting yesterday.",jim
52916,"Wait, sales'what sales meeting?",dwight
52917,The new guys called one.,jim
52918,The new guys called a sales meeting?,dwight
52919,Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?,jim
52920,There's no belt above black. Is there a belt above black?,dwight
52921,You should ask him. It's a color you would never expect. [Dwight storms off] Too easy.,jim
52925,I wanted to talk to you about our working relationship this year. It's going to be terrible.,andy
52927,"No I'm going to make sure that it is. And if it isn't, I'm going to take immediate action to rectify that. Now, I don't like to throw around the b-word, but I'm going to be a huge bitch to you.",andy
52928,Now this is called slack lining.,andy
52929,"I set up the old slack line to teach the office the skills of focus and discipline. Or in the case of certain individuals, the skills of humiliation and looking really dumb.",andy
52930,"If you make it all the way across, your confidence will soar. But, if you Toby out, then you'll feel like a real Nellie. How about a hand, screw those guys. Now, these are my actual Outward Bound counselors, Rafe and Feather.",andy
52932,"That's me. The powder is for your protection, Feather has permanent athlete's foot. Feather, show them how you dance upon the line of slack.",andy
52933,You a sports fan?,jim
52935,Oh. Any team sports?,jim
52937,"Phillies fan, though, right?",jim
52939,"No, like baseball. A baseball team.",jim
52941,Ok. Good talk.,jim
52942,I have nothing in common with Plop.,jim
52943,"All right, who's next? Nellie?",andy
52945,Nonsense. Get up here.,andy
52947,"Come on. Uh, are you gonna wear your heels?",andy
52949,"Ok, sure. There ya go. Atta girl. Hey, alright. Whoa! [pushes Nellie off slack line] You suck. Alright, who's next? Darryl?",andy
52951,Dwight Jr? This looks like your speed.,andy
52953,"Yeah, come on. Get up here. Just hop on up.",andy
52955,Focus on the horizon. [Clark successfully walks the slack line] Whoa! Look at this guy.,andy
52958,"Hey, yes.",andy
52959,"Boo, unimpressed. It's a tightrope for babies. Boo!",dwight
52961,Alright. Let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord.,andy
52962,Ooh! Who ordered the hot apple fail?,andy
52963,"Ok, I am just getting started, ok?",dwight
52965,Well it's official. Old Dwight is lame and New Dwight is cool.,andy
52966,[bleeding heavily from the mouth] That's not true.  Just give me another chance.,dwight
52969,What?,dwight
52971,This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it. [tries to go in locked door] Idiots.,dwight
52972,"Slack lining, please. Untie that rope, give it to a couple of pig-tailed school girls, let them start jumping with it while chanting a rhyme and giggling about boys. Doesn't seem so macho now, does it? It's a jump rope!",dwight
52973,Dwight!,pam
52974,"Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on.",dwight
52975,[sees trapeze contraption] What are you doing?,pam
52976,"Come here, I'll show you.",dwight
52983,"Oh, come on, Pete! God, that's just sad. If he doesn't watch himself, he's gonna be here for years, doing nothing. [sober realization] Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.",jim
52984,Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire? That means it's literally impossible for anyone to fall off. So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole.,dwight
52985,I will?,pam
52986,"You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldn't you say?",dwight
52987,"Sure, if you weigh 105 pounds.",pam
52988,So you'll do it?,dwight
52989,No.,pam
52990,"Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.",dwight
52991,"Dwight, you may find this hard to believe, but I love my boring life.",pam
52992,Come on.,dwight
52993,Exactly the way it is.,pam
52994,"No, Pam.",dwight
52995,"Yes, and there's nothing you could say that would get me to run the slightest risk of losing it.",pam
52996,"Please? Please, Pam?",dwight
52997,"Find someone else, I don't know. Ask Phyllis.",pam
52998,"I can't use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar I'll be launched into space. God, you're so insensitive.",dwight
53010,You ready?,pam
53011,Yeah. You know what? I'll meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.,jim
53012,Kay.,pam
53013,"Ok. [prepares bike trapeze]Oh, god.",dwight
53014,"Attention, employees of Dunder Mifflin. Everyone thinks the new guys are so cool cause they can slack line. Boo. Hey Clark, this is what a areal salesman looks like. They say that you only live once and I'm about to prove it. Dwight Schrute!",dwight
53015,"Hey, man. It's halpert. Did you go to the other guy yet? Great, don't. I'm in. Yeah, yep, I'm all in. Ok, talk to you soon. Bye. [hangs up] Yeah!",jim
53016,"Woo! [starts pedaling out until trapeze bike flips over, he dangles from the handlebars] Ahh!!",dwight
53022,There are two things that I am passionate about. Recycling and revenge.,andy
53024,"[surveying an untidy office] The building's custodian is on vacation for the month and Dwight is too cheap to hire a replacement. So, instead, we're living in filth. But, not for long. Because I have created the chore wheel.",pam
53026,"Well, it doesn't spin. We'll just move the wheel one notch each morning and' you see what chore you get that day.",pam
53029,"No, I'm familiar with spinning. It's just that wouldn't work with a chore wheel because people might get the same chore-",pam
53030,"[interrupting] Bugh, boring. All she talks about is chores.",andy
53032,[reluctantly] Spinning would be more fun.,jim
53033,[frustrated] 'Kay.,pam
53035,"Yes, you clean all the mugs in the sink.",pam
53038,I don't think you guys understand why we're doing this. It's-,pam
53040,"I've been through several rounds of development with the team and here's where we stand with the chore wheel. [introducing a third 'chore wheel', excited] We've got prizes! Ten bucks, candy bar, manager for an hour but, there are also penalties. Like, no internet, Stanley gets your lunch. The one thing that is not on the chore wheel is chores. But they were right; it's more fun this way.",pam
53041,[everyone cheers as Meredith spins and lands on 'tiny wheel'] The tiny wheel actually does have chores. It's so cute no one seems to mind.,pam
53042,[referencing the 'tiny wheel'] Toilets! [everyone cheers as Meredith accepts her chore],pam
53043,"[at the Halpert residence as Cece twirls in the front yard, exiting front door] Pam, we gotta go. Cece, go back inside. Grandma's got breakfast, OK? [to camera] We are going to Roy's wedding. Yep, Roy. I think the only weird thing about going to your wife's ex-fianc'??s wedding on a weekday at eight AM is that it's your wife's ex-fianc??.",jim
53044,"[exiting house] Thanks, mom!",pam
53045,[to Pam] A banana?,jim
53046,Yeah. I'm afraid he's only gonna have hot dogs.,pam
53047,"Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.",jim
53048,Planned a wedding with him. He wanted hot dogs.,pam
53049,[to camera] Just' so weird.,jim
53068,[Jim and Pam approaching the wedding venue] Is this his house?,jim
53069,Think so.,pam
53071,[taking glass] Thank you.,pam
53073,"[embarrassed] Yes, thank you. [finishes banana and hands server the peel]",pam
53074,OK.,jim

53076,"Uh, my ex-fianc??.",jim
53077,[sarcastically] Ha-ha.,pam
53078,"I started a new business with my college friend. But, Pam doesn't know. Um' actually I did tell Pam and we decided 'no'. But, then I decided 'yes' anyway. So, I'm thinking there's another conversation coming. And, it's hard to know when that will be.",jim
53088,I will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works.,dwight
53089,"Uh, correction, I give to a foundation that teaches homeless children nautical flag signaling. Changes lives.",andy
53091,I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for the preservation of nautical flag signaling.,andy
53093,No thank you.,dwight
53095,"Fine, I chose the Global Relief Foundation.",dwight
53097,Which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban.,dwight
53099,Yeah. The Taliban in Afa-ghanistan.,dwight
53102,"Well, it looks like there won't be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome. [wads up Nellie's charity sheet and tosses it toward her]",dwight

53143,It was an away game.,jim
53144,"In Phoenix. They should really tell you that more specifically. I mean, every game is an away game for one of the teams. [long pause] Do we know everything about each other?",pam
53145,No.,jim

53149,And you thought you guys were millionaires.,pam
53150,You heard that one.,jim
53151,"Yes. But there's, wait, oh, there's a funny ending to that story. I can't remember.",pam
53152,That I thought we were millionaires.,jim
53153,"Thought you were millionaires, yeah. That's funny. Shoot, I knew that one.",pam
53154,That's all right.,jim
53156,You all right? [Oscar nods],jim
53158,Anything else would be inconsistent.,dwight

53164,What the? [follows Nellie into the break room],dwight
53166,[taking pen back] Gimme that.,dwight

53170,"Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you.",dwight
53172,"[considers then takes cleaver] This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you'll miss the most.",dwight

53175,[in his office] Clark wants to film you in different outfits inside his apartment?,andy

53251,[after a pause] That didn't happen. You would've told me right away.,jim

55239,"No, impish or admirable.",dwight
55240,"Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?",jim
55241,I decided earlier.,dwight
55242,"Oh, nice. Did you check that list?",jim
55243,Of course I checked it.,dwight
55244,But more than once? 'cause you could have made a mistake.,jim
55245,I checked it more than once.,dwight
55246,"Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's--",jim
55247,Impish or admirable.,dwight
55248,Damn.,jim

55258,"In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.",dwight
55259,"Oh, you know what? I gotta go.",jim
55260,Stop giggling.,dwight
55261,"Oh, really? Already?",pam
55262,"Yeah, it's all right.",jim

55286,Well...this is it.,pam
55287,I'm probably never gonna see you again.,jim
55288,Shut up. I'm trying to be serious.,pam
55289,"Okay, sorry, sorry.",jim
55290,I can't believe this is actually happening.,pam
55291,"Listen, thank you so much for putting that all together. That was the perfect last Christmas party. All right, wish me luck.",jim
55292,Okay. [Jim and Pam hug] Good luck. You're gonna be great.,pam
55293,I'll call you when I get in.,jim
55294,Okay.,pam
55295,All right.,jim
55296,Love you.,pam
55297,Love you.,jim
55298,What's going on?,pam
55299,"Party's over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you. [To camera] And guess what, kids. Belsnickel isn't real. It's me, Dwight! [Takes off hat and beard]",dwight
55306,"For what it's worth, I liked your party better.",pam
55307,"Everyone thought the food was gross, and that belsnickel was some darkly erotic freak.",dwight
55308,I don't think anyone thought that.,pam
55309,Jim couldn't even stay till the end of the party.,dwight
55310,"Well, that didn't have anything to do with you.",pam

55313,Damn It!,dwight
55320,"Dwight, want me to get you some eggnog?",pam
55321,"No, thanks. I'll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt.",dwight
55322,"[Walks back into The Office] Yep, I did say that.",jim
55323,Jim!,pam
55324,What's going on? Where's the belsnickel?,jim

55326,"What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building.",jim

55328,What happened? Did you miss your bus?,pam
55329,No. I just missed my wife.[Gives Pam a hug and a kiss],jim
55330,"[Comes back in, holding up the pig rib] I found it!",dwight
55331,And I found out that there's a bus at 5:00 a.m.,jim
55332,"Oh! [Pig rib breaks and Jim wins, and stuff splatters people. Everyone groans] Damn It! Jim got the bigger half.",dwight
55334,"Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog. [Everyone talking Phyllis pours Jim some eggnog, as Daryl walks in] Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy?",jim
55336,"Oh, hey, man. [Daryl walks over to Jim, angrily and stares at Jim] Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview.",jim
55338,Right?,jim
55340,"Hey, of course.",jim
55342,"Thank you, sir. [Tips his glass to Daryl]",jim
55344,Go get 'em.,jim
55346,Very impish.,dwight

55360,"Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don't even-... [Jim bites his lip]",jim
55361,I bit my lip at lunch today.,jim
55364,Now I have this big bump in my lip that hurts. I hate it.,jim
55366,"Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the... [Jim bites his lip again and pounds on table]",jim
55367,"Whatever. It's not a big deal. You know I always tell my three year old, if this is the worst thing that's gonna happen...[Jim bites his lip again] You gotta be kidding me! Ok! Pam! That's it, I'm going home!",jim
55369,What?,pam
55371,"Jim's been spending a few days a week in Philly and I'm not gonna lie, it's been challenging. Yesterday, things took a turn for the worse. I found out Cece has lice. So I was up all night disinfecting every sheet, towel, toy, item of clothing in the entire house. I'm exhausted. But don't tell Jim. He has a huge meeting today, under a lot of pressure and he's doing it all for the family.",pam
55372,"I am meeting Dr. J today, otherwise known as Julius Irving, famed 76er and my own personal hero. But i have to be careful not to rub it in Pam's face because let's be honest, how would I feel if I was at home stuck with the kids while she was go carting with John Stamos.",jim
55373,[talking on phone] You sound tired. Everything ok?,jim
55374,Great. Everything's great. Hey are you nervous about your big meeting?,pam
55375,"Uhh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know, but that's what I signed up for right?",jim
55377,"Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.",jim
55378,"Oh, call me later!",pam
55379,Ok,jim
55380,Good luck!,pam
55381,Thanks!,jim
55382,Love you.,pam
55383,Love you too. Bye.,jim
55391,"Hey Meredith, I need your supplier requests today.",pam
55393,He didn't leave me. He just went part time. [Meredith scratches her head vigorously] Can you just fill out the form please?,pam
55395,"I'm sure she's just confused. People scratch their heads when they're confused. Not always like an ape, the way Meredith just did, but it happens.",pam
55400,"What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine.",dwight
55401,"Dwight, relax. It's just lice. Maybe, possibly.",pam
55402,Just lice Pam?,dwight
55403,"Of all of the vermin in God's great green kingdom, lice are the ones I detest the most. My first day of school, I had lice, and no one would play with me. For 15 years, they called me freak and four eyes and sci-fi nerd and girl puncher. All because I had lice when I was 7.",dwight
55404,"Make way, nope, inspect me.",dwight
55406,Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning. [Dwight starts spraying everyone with disinfectant],dwight
55407,Stop that!,pam
55411,"Alright, let's give her a break. We don't know for sure this is Meredith's fault.",pam
55418,No! How? I'm so clean!,pam
55422,"It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free? [Phyllis, Kevin, Darryl. and Nellie raise their hands] Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?",dwight
55425,"Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch.",dwight
55433,"Guys, I think we should all ease up on Meredith. This has got to be hard for her.",pam
55440,"Maybe it was Meredith. Maybe she brought in lice that are totally different than the lice that i got from Cece. So let's not jump to the simplest conclusion that she got her lice from me. That is how wars get started. Fine, I'll tell her it was me.",pam
55441,"Oh man, that's fresh squeezed. And, uh are all the snacks complimentary?",jim
55443,"Oh no, no, no. That's ok. [Jim shoves some snacks in his pocket as he gets out of limo] Um I'm sorry, is this the conference center?",jim
55445,You gotta be kidding me.,jim
55446,"Hey, Meredith I need to tell you something.",pam
55448,"Oh my God, Meredith what are you doing!?",pam
55450,Oh stop! I am so sorry!,pam
55452,Nothing.,pam
55453,"I am going to tell her, but now is clearly not the time.  I will buy her a wig, we'll have a few laughs. There's a right way to do this.",pam
55454,"Scalp leeches, skull vampires, follicle gypsies, hair lawyers. One thing is clear, it's kill or be killed!",dwight
55456,To be burned!,dwight
55459,I'm not gonna lie. Lye!,dwight
55462,"She's right, it works. I would imagine.",pam
55473,"Oh! Uh, uh I'll go.",pam
55476,"No, no, it's not a big deal, please. No. Um, Meredith can I get you something special while I'm at the store, candy, or...or one of those stylish turbans?",pam
55478,Okay.,pam
55479,"Let's talk pubes, people.",dwight
55495,Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.,jim
55497,"Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball.",jim
55499,"Alright. [Jim's phone rings] Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this?",jim
55501,"Right! [Jim laughs as he answers the phone] Hey, what's up? Everything ok?",jim
55502,"Oh, no everything's great! Um, I was just calling to see how the meeting went.",pam
55503,"It's still happening right now actually, so uh...",jim
55504,"He's really making you work for it, huh?",pam
55505,"Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay?",jim
55506,"Great. I am killing it over here. [drops mayonnaise on the ground] Jim, I gotta go.",pam
55507,"Okay, bye. [Jim turns back to Julius] So sorry about that.",jim
55509,I love it.,jim
55511,"Oh sure, and when you're ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right. [Dwight holds up a pair of scissors]",dwight
55513,"[swings the scissors around and puts them into his pocket, putting a hole in his Hazmat suit] Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No!",dwight
55520,"Hey, Creed, wanna be my buddy?",pam
55525,"[putting mayo on Creed's head] Creed, I'm all done. My turn.",pam
55527,"Well, wait.",pam
55544,[phone rings]  Hello?,pam
55546,"What, no. That can't...I don't...",pam
55550,"[everyone yelling at Pam]You guys, I am so sorry! It's just been so chaotic with Jim gone, that...",pam
55552,[talking through the loud speaker] She's right Pam.,dwight
55553,Is there a volume knob on that thing?,pam
55554,Yeah there's a volume knob on that thing.,dwight
55555,"Meredith, I am so sorry.",pam
55557,I meant to say something earlier. I just...,pam
55560,"Attention, people of the office. You have exactly 60 secondes to evacutate the bull pen. At that time, I will be tossing this powerful insecticidal grenade, which contains piperonyl butoxide, as well as...[Dwight drops the grenade and it goes off inside Andy's office]",dwight
55562,"Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don't think it's kicked in yet. I'm gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple. [Dwight collapses]",dwight
55583,"I had a pretty good day today. Not everything went exactly according to plan, but lice if you are watching, I am ready for you anytime, anywhere. [Dwight gets into his car and another insecticidal grenade goes off]",dwight
55588,"Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.",jim
55590,And that's all?,jim
55592,"No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done.",jim
55594,"[Jim's phone goes to voicemail] This is Jim Halpert, leave a message.",jim
55595,"Hey honey, it's me. Just trying to catch you before going home. Um, oh, well just give me a call whenever. Hope your day got better. Love you.",pam
55597,I'm just gonna go home. My mom's been watching the kids all day.,pam
55599,Really? A beer sounds incredible right now.,pam
55601,"Meredith, I am so sorry about today.",pam
55603,"I just did not realize how hard it was gonna be without Jim. I mean, I really respect you for being a single mom all these years. It whipped my ass in half a week. I have to say, there are not a lot of people who could pull off a shaved head, but you are rocking it.",pam

55615,"Okay. There's no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.",jim
55616,"Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity.",dwight
55618,"Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears. [back to Jim] See what you leave me with here, Jim?",dwight
55619,"Hey, I'm in Philadelphia right now.",jim
55620,How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.,dwight

55905,"Oh, I expected more from young Halpert.",jim
55906,Let's just forget it. Forget it. [warehouse worker dips donut into golden chalice],dwight
55918,Hey.,jim
55920,"Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later.",jim
55922,"Cece's ballet recital is today. I cannot wait. I've been working with her on her move. It's called the Cece Spin and Kiss. Do you want to see it? It's kind of like this. It's pretty cute, right?",jim
55923,"Pfft, 'Athlead'? Please. They're too lazy to call it Athletes Lead? Jim should just call it 'Stumpany,' for 'Stupid Company.'",dwight
55925,You're working for 'Stumpany' too?,dwight
55927,What?,dwight
55929,"[on phone] Hey, Halpert, what's the big idea? First you jump ship. Now you're stealing Darryl too. When will it end?",dwight
55930,"Well, take your worst fear and multiply it by infinity.",jim
55931,You won't stop until you've poached us all.,dwight
55932,Yeah. Even you.,jim
55933,No. I'll be damned if I'm gonna let us lose me.,dwight
55934,"Bye, Dwight.",jim
55935,Hi. How are ya? Good to see you.,jim
55936,"Hey, Angela? Did you hear about the Irish-American Cultural Center mural?",pam
55938,"Oh, no, Kevin, it's not a joke. Angela's husband put me up for a-- um, just never mind.",pam
55940,"Senator Lipton helped me submit my design for a new mural on a building downtown. Now I'm just waiting to hear from the selection committee. But, you know, let's be realistic. There are a ton of great artists in Scranton with way more experience. I mean, who are they gonna go with -- some nobody like me or a big name like Tracy Fleeb?",pam
55941,"Well, I'm heading out to Cece's dance recital.",pam
55943,"Hey, Cece, Daddy's gonna have dinner with us tonight after he comes to your recital. Are you excited?",pam
55945,Let's call him.,pam
55946,Hey. I was just about to call you.,jim
55947,"Hey, Hon, are you close?",pam
55948,"I am still in Philly, actually.",jim
55949,What?,pam
55950,"It's insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so I'm stuck here trying to keep him on board.",jim
55951,"Hon, I wish you would have told me an hour ago, when you knew you weren't gonna make it.",pam
55952,"Pam, I couldn't get out. I barely made it out just to make this phone call.",jim
55954,"You're gonna do great. And you know what? Mommy's gonna record it. So we'll watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?",jim
55955,Of course.,pam
55956,Okay. Are you sure you know how to do video on the phone?,jim
55957,"Yes, Jim, I think I know how to point a rectangle at something.",pam
55958,"Okay, okay, you know, just sometimes you're not the best with the phone.",jim
55959,"I know how to operate my phone, okay? Listen, we're getting close. We will talk to you later. Say, 'Bye, Daddy.'",pam
55961,"Bye. ??[pause] Yep. See, you've still got to press 'End,' Pam.",jim

55977,You're welcome.,dwight
55979,"This -- uh, what? Double mocha latte, please? You got it. Just sign your name below. Whatever you want.",dwight
55982,"Yeah, we'll see about that.",dwight
55983,"Bust out your complaint files. I need everything you've got on Darryl since he started working for Jim in the last few weeks. Break it down by keyword, okay? 'Infuriating, irresponsible'...",dwight
55985,"Okay, I'm gonna need you to print it out.",dwight
55986,[writing on white board] Customer Loyalty. What is it? Can you hold it in your hand? Can you nudge it with your finger? Can you dump it on a woman? No. Why? Because it's an idea. But what does it mean?,dwight
55988,Not even close. Mr. Romanko has been a client for 20 years. He came in today in a rage. Why? Because of Darryl. Because Darryl was focusing on outside projects and needs to remember his first priority-- the client.,dwight
55992,"No, you're not going anywhere, okay? You are angry, and we are gonna hear you out, all right? Because business is about relationships, and the key to relationships is what, Darryl? ??L--",dwight
55994,Loyalty.,dwight
55996,Thank you.,dwight
56003,Yes.,dwight
56005,Yeah.,dwight

56019,"[whispering] Hello? Yes, this is Pam Halpert. I got the mural? [Loudly] Oh, my God!",pam
56021,"[whispering] Um, I'm sorry. I have to go. My daughter's a ladybug. I know that doesn't make any sense. Um, thank you, thank you.",pam
56024,Shh! Kids are dancing.,pam
56025,"Thank you so much for coming. Darryl and I will be here to serve you for years and years and years and years. [chuckles] So, should we go call Jim and tell him to go screw himself?",dwight
56027,It can't be more fun than selling paper and paper products.,dwight
56029,"Are you pretending to be crazy, huh?",dwight
56043,"Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but he's gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--",jim
56044,"Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, he'll be calling in any second.",jim
56045,"[on phone] Hey, uh, give me a call back when you get a chance. Cece did great, and I want to tell you something.",pam
56051,You looking for fun? It just found you! Woo! [laughs] Here we go! Yeah!,dwight
56052,"Yes, we will be delivering a shipment of paper today, but I will also be delivering you a big shipment of fun!",dwight
56054,"Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports. [throws small ball at Darryl]",dwight
56068,Yes. Fast food. I'll take a burger over a gross Philly cheese-steak any day.,dwight
56070,Not like this.,dwight
56073,Thank you.,dwight
56075,"Nope. [throwing milkshake] Fire in the hole! [laughs] Oh, yeah! Now that's what working at a paper company's all about!",dwight
56076,"Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go.",dwight
56078,"It's a youtube thing! Let's go. Let's go. Come on, they're coming.",dwight
56079,Anyone want to see the video from Cece's recital?,pam
56082,"All right, you don't have to.",pam
56084,Okay.,pam
56086,Wait. What?,pam
56087,"[recorded on phone] Excuse me, I have to get back to work.",pam
56088,"Oh, no. I took a phone call in the middle of taping, and then when I went to turn it back on, I must have turned it off.",pam
56091,"Well, it was an important phone call.",pam
56092,"I haven't told anyone here about the mural yet. I want Jim to be the first to know. Whenever I tell him good news, he's always like, 'Beesly!' I love that. Only thing better than getting the job-- 'Beesly!' [chuckles]",pam
56095,[cleaning up milkshake in restaurant] It barely even feels like a prank anymore.,dwight
56098,"Ha ha! Yeah, joke's on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up!",dwight
56108,[sighs],dwight
56110,What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee?,dwight
56113,Night,pam
56115,"Night, Creed.",pam
56116,Hey.,pam
56117,Hey.,jim
56118,"So, how's it going?",pam
56119,"We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. It's like everything I did, he just wouldn't go for it.",jim
56120,I'm so sorry.,pam
56121,"I have no idea where we're gonna come up with this money, and we have to work insanely hard over the next few weeks.",jim
56122,"[sighs] Oh, I'm sorry. I feel like you've already been working insanely hard.",pam
56123,Can you figure out how to upload Cece's dance recital? I definitely could use a pick-me-up.,jim
56124,"Um, actually, funny story -- I didn't get it. I shouldn't have been so cocky about my rectangle-holding skills after all.",pam
56125,"You're not serious, are you? You didn't get any of the recital?",jim
56126,"No, I got the teacher introducing them and then the applause afterwards. But not so much of the middle part.",pam
56127,"Come on, Pam. Pam, I asked you if you could use the phone, and you swore that you knew how.",jim
56128,"Yeah, okay, I'm sorry. I'm sure we can get a copy. A lot of people were taping it.",pam
56129,"Oh, great. So we'll see somebody else's kid with Cece in the background? I mean, it's really not that hard to film a video.",jim
56130,Is there-- um... you want to ease up a little bit?,pam
56131,"Look, Pam, I don't know what to tell you. I mean, what do I do? It's gone. That moment's just gone. I missed it.",jim
56132,"I don't know, Jim -- maybe you should have been there.",pam
56133,"You're not serious, right? I mean, how is that fair? I'm in Philly. These are my days in Philly. You've agreed to this.",jim
56134,You know what? I-- I-- I don't think you want to start a conversation with me about what's fair. Okay? This is way more intense than I ever --,pam
56135,"Pam, I'm not explaining this to you-- Pam, I'm not going over this again.",jim
56137,"I don't know how else to tell you, okay? I'm doing everything I can every week to bring home something...",jim
56138,"I am-- I am-- I am trying to make everything perfect here, okay? So that you can have everything that you want.",pam
56139,"I'm doing this just for me? Is that what I'm doing? I'm doing it just for me. If that's what you think, then this is a really sad night. But you know what? I got to go. Okay?",jim
56140,Yep.,pam
56141,We'll talk tomorrow?,jim
56142,Yep. I'll talk to you tomorrow.,pam
56143,Okay. I'll talk to you tomorrow.,jim
56144,"Bye. [quietly crying, sniffling]",pam
56146,"What am I doing wrong, Brian?",pam
56150,[crying],pam
56152,It's getting tougher. I just didn't know that it was gonna be this hard.,pam
56154,Thank you.,pam
56161,"Hey Brian, you got a sec?",pam
56163,I feel awful.,pam
56166,"Well, thanks for being a good friend.",pam
56168,"Yeah, mostly.",pam
56170,"Um, hey, say Hi to Alyssa.",pam
56172,Okay. Thank you.,pam
56180,"That's right, a couple of old friends. Ballers only. Must be this cool to ride.",dwight
56182,"Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did.",dwight
56183,"Wallace is letting me hire a junior sales associate to sit at Jim's desk while he's away in Philly. Finally I'll have someone at my desk clump who gets me. It's like, 'Really, Jim? You don't understand the difference between a slaughterhouse and a rendering plant? Uh, remind me not to lend you any dead cows or horses.' Wow.",dwight
56185,Mm-hmm.,dwight
56187,"You know what? You're gonna get your interview, okay? I know that you're going head-to-head against some real superstars, but you got a really good chance.",dwight
56188,"Clark has no chance. I mean, he's up against my buddy Rolf, for God's sake. Guy goes fishing with hand grenades. And Trevor ' he'll make you laugh so hard, you'll puke your pants.",dwight
56190,Big changes coming to the old desk clump. No longer a Pam-Jim alliance against Dwight. Now it is Dwight and a friend axis against Pam.,dwight
56191,"You could've just called that an alliance too, right?",jim
56192,I chose my words very carefully.,dwight
56193,"Things are a little delicate with me and Pam right now. And if my working in Philly is gonna end up doubling the Dwight in her life, that's only gonna make things worse.",jim
56201,"Hey. Come on, buddy. Let's do this. Sorry, Rolf goes first.  You don't compare. When you're with the R-O-L-F, you're literally Rolling on the Laughing Floor. [laughs]",dwight
56203,"Rolf is my best friend, and he is the man. Cool, calm, and collected 24/7. Just try and rattle Rolf. I dare you. Such a sweet guy.",dwight
56204,When are you talking to David Wallace?,pam
56205,"I'm talking to him this afternoon, but don't get your hopes up.",jim
56206,Too late. My hopes are up.,pam
56207,"Last week, my company in Philly lost a big investor, so we're scrambling to find new funding. Luckily, my partners have a fix ' me asking the boss of the company I'm abandoning to give us a gigantic influx of cash.  So' problem solved. Thanks, guys.",jim
56208,And this chair's gonna be yours. And this desk. Ha!,dwight
56209,I'm on the phone. I'm on the phone.,jim
56210,No doy!,dwight
56211,I'm just gonna call you back. Thanks.,jim
56213,[laughs] No earbuds! [both laugh],dwight
56214,I'm sure he's just nervous.,jim
56215,[sighs] It's fine. It's just a seating arrangement. Doesn't matter.,pam
56216,"So I've got your resume here, but it's not telling me everything.",dwight
56218,"Well, I'm the one offering the job.",dwight
56220,I've worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. I'm an Assistant to the Regional Manager.,dwight
56222,"Wait, wait, wait, no, I mean, if you need to know more, you can call David Wallace. I'm sure he'd give a reference.",dwight
56224,"Well, they can't all be winners. But Trevor's next and he's a real professional. You say, 'Jump,' and he says, 'Oh who?' He loves to jump on people, that Trevor.",dwight
56225,What makes you think you'd be an effective paper salesman?,dwight
56227,"Well, it's a pretty basic question for a potential paper salesman.",dwight
56229,All right. Do you see yourself as more of a team player or a self-starter?,dwight
56231,There were only two options.,dwight
56233,This is a bus transfer.,dwight
56236,"Sure, yeah, go ahead.",jim
56238,"Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? You're clean, right?",jim
56240,"Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You don't listen to it at all because we're at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so'",jim
56242,"Sure, yeah. Do whatever you need to do.",jim
56244,Right after you do one thing for me. I need you to breathe in my face.,jim
56246,I need you to breathe in my face right now.,jim
56248,"What are we working with, peppermint or wintergreen?",jim
56250,"I knew it, I knew it.",jim
56252,"I looked at you coming around, and I said, 'Wintergreen.'",jim
56253,"I can't hire Clark. Yeah, he looks like a Schrute, but he thinks like a Halpert and he acts like a Beesly.",dwight
56254,"Okay, here's one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock.  You can't rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.",dwight
56256,Thank you.,dwight
56258,"Damn it! Perfect answer, again.",dwight
56260,"Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond '",dwight
56262,And anoth',dwight
56264,No.,dwight
56266,"It does, but still no.",dwight
56268,"Oh, you think they're my only friends? I've got way more friends than that, and they're all better than the losers who work here.",dwight
56271,"Well, of course not, but does physical appearance include smell?",pam
56276,"Next up, my cousin Mose. Mose could make a great paper salesman. He's got a natural fear of paper, which would motivate him to get as much of it out of this office as possible. I've got big expectations, Mose-wise.",dwight
56277,What quality would make you a good sales associate?,dwight
56279,It says here on your resume that you spent the last 15 years as a sales rep for Dow Chemical.,dwight
56281,"You know we live together, right?",dwight
56283,"And I've never seen you go to work, ever.",dwight
56285,So why is this on your resume? [door slams],dwight
56297,"When I was young, I spent several years at a private school where I was told I would be taught to harness my mutant abilities. Turned out it was a conman copying Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters from the X-Men comic books. Took me years to figure out that it was a con. Some people never figured it out.",dwight
56302,How is it my fault?,jim
56304,But it's Dwight who's bring in all the weirdos.,jim
56306,"Hey, I'm the one who has to sit next to this weirdo when Jim's away. I'm in a position where I'm rooting for Nate, and that just feels wrong. [sighs] Forget it.  I need to work on my mural. I have some pointy trees that I need to round off.",pam
56308,"Yeah, this is actually about the new sales guy. Uh, Dwight has brought in a bunch of real weirdos. And I was wondering if I could have some input'",jim
56309,[presses speaker button] This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And don't lie. I can tell if you're lying.,dwight
56311,David.,dwight
56313,"Really? That's interesting. 'Cause I was thinking that since Jim is only here part time, he might not be as invested in the decision-making process as someone like me who's here every day. And frankly, killing it lately.",dwight
56314,"I was just thinking that because this person is gonna be sitting at my desk, near my wife'",jim
56316,Oh. Um',jim
56318,Okay. I can't say that that's not fair.,jim
56319,"Sounds fair to me, David.",dwight
56321,"Oh, yeah, so we'll just do that later.",jim
56322,No. Why not do it now?,dwight
56324,"Uh' [clears throat] Well, it's about Athlead. I'm sorry. Does Dwight have to be on this part of the phone call?",jim
56325,"I'd love to be in the loop, David.",dwight
56327,There's a very exciting opportunity to be a core investor ',jim
56329,"Yes, okay. Bye.",jim
56330,[whispers] I'd love to invest.,dwight
56331,"No, thanks.",jim
56332,I'd like to give you $100 million. [snickers] [phone ringing],dwight
56334,"Hide, they're giving out jobs upstairs. Why don't you go up and get one?",pam
56336,Yeah.,pam
56339,"Dwight, you can't just hire someone 'cause they're your friend.",jim
56340,I'm not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend.,dwight
56342,You know who else was a freak? Spider-man. And he was also a hero.,dwight
56345,"Mandatory paintball. Uh, wolf, please report to the parking lot for mandatory paintball at lunch.",dwight
56346,"Wolf is hilarious. He has executed me over 100 times at point-blank range. Half of 'em, we were on the same team. Oh my God. How I screamed. Ah, that goof.",dwight
56347,Sell me this piece of paper. Watch this.,dwight
56349,I sure do.,dwight
56351,I will pay you whatever it takes.,dwight
56353,"No, you have lots of other pieces of paper that are just like it. So here, just take my money.",dwight
56355,Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. You're still at the 570 number?,dwight
56357,"Okay. Good, good, good. [sighs]",dwight
56359,This isn't gonna work out.,dwight
56361,"Nate is a proven entity, but not without his handicaps; hearing, vision, basic cognition. Trevor is great, but I saw no fire in him today. And this is a guy who loves to start fires. Troy is literally one of a kind. He's a goblin, or a hobbit, or a kobold, which is a type of gremlin. And yet I'm hesitant. Why can't I pull the trigger on any of them?",dwight
56362,"[groaning] No, no, no. I just need to tell them. I just need to tell them. [knock at door]",dwight
56364,I do that myself now.,dwight
56366,"No, you've been towed by now. They tow after about 45 minutes.",dwight
56370,Or none of you [chuckles],dwight
56373,I wish I could hire all of you.,dwight
56375,"Psst. Jim Jim? [whispering] Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around. Jim, turn around.",dwight
56376,"Ahh, I love staring off in one direction. If I'm not looking south, I'm not livin'.  That's what I always say.",jim
56377,Just act natural. [grunts],dwight
56378,And I was thinking it's only fair that you help make this decision since they'll be sitting at your desk next to your wife.,dwight
56379,But you know I wouldn't hire any of these all-stars.,jim
56380,"Aah! God, that sucks! Aah! What are you gonna do? I mean, it's your call.",dwight
56381,Nope. Your friends not turning out to be as great as you thought? Not even Gabor?,jim
56382,I guess I just have higher standards for my work colleagues than for my friends. I just couldn't picture any of them in the old gold and gray.,dwight
56383,I knew it. You designed a uniform for Dunder Mifflin.,jim
56384,Summer. Winter. Jungle. Formal.,dwight
56385,"Well, I for one, was amazed at how qualified everyone was. You?",jim
56386,Yes. Thank you. Amazed.,dwight
56387,"And I gotta say, this was a tough decision. And we had to go with none of you.",jim
56389,What? This is such bullcrap!,dwight
56390,"Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say.",jim
56391,Wow. So much crap. It's just a load of B.C. How could you do this to them?,dwight
56392,Too much now.,jim
56393,Okay.,dwight
56395,"Okay, this is an outrage. Ugh! You know what? This is Jim Halpert's home address, in case you guys wanna toilet paper his house or whatever.",dwight
56396,That seems inconsiderate.,jim
56398,"Guys, it wasn't up to me. Rolf, come on. Guys, it wasn't my choice! I would have hired all of you! Gabor, Gabor.",dwight
56402,"Oh, that sounds awesome. Can we wait till I get off work?",dwight
56404,Okay.,dwight
56407,All right. I think that went well.,jim
56408,"So, uh, if you just take a look at this, and then that'll print out'Hey. Meet your new desk mate.",jim
56410,"Oh, cool. Hey Clark.",pam
56411,"Trust me, this is the least of all evils. It took me all day to pull this off, so you should be thrilled, considering.",jim
56412,"Yeah, I guess. I mean, I kinda liked my old desk mate.",pam
56413,Okay. I'm really sorry I told the guys I'd be there for the board meeting.,jim
56414,Of course.,pam

56437,"No, Dwight!",pam
56438,Aah!,dwight
56439,"No, it does matter who ends up sitting next to Pam when I'm gone. The people around you are basically who you end up spending your life with. I mean, because of where my desk was, I spent all those years looking at Pam, and I fell in love. So, that stuff matters. Definitely does.",jim
56450,"I've really been putting in the hours on this mural. And my boss is totally OK with it, because he's in the Bahamas and has no clue what anybody is doing. I'm usually very self-critical.

56466,"And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.",jim
56468,I'm couching it!,jim
56470,"And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this?",jim
56472,"[ascends on lift, using megaphone] Attention, everyone. Can I have your attention, please? Yeah, I don't know everybody's name down here, but whoever did this will you please raise your hand. [no one replies] Hello? This is not over. OK? I will stay up here all day if I have to. Is that what you want? [descends on lift] Yeah, I will also come down if I want to. It's my choice.",pam
56473,"I don't demand justice often. I'm not like Angela, who calls a lawyer every time someone watches a YouTube video of animals doing it. But, someone should get fired over this, right? Val's no help. Andy's gone. Jim's out. I just feel like I'm on my own here. [boom microphone bumps her head, she smiles] I mean, OK, not completely on my own. But, in terms of people who can do something. Thank you, Brian.",pam
56474,"Hey. So, Wade wants to send people to the Sloan conference. We gotta compile a list of our target clients.",jim
56476,[to camera] Who is this guy? We are killing it.,jim
56478,Yeah!,jim
56479,[entering office] Conference room. Everybody. Now!,pam
56480,You don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.,dwight
56481,"Yes, but David Wallace does. And he asked me to gather everyone to talk about stuff... That's gonna be revealed once we're in the conference room for the meeting.",pam
56482,"You're telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?",dwight
56483,Yeah.,pam
56484,"Let's go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!",dwight
56485,[to everyone in conference room] I have terrible news. Someone defaced my mural. They painted all over it.,pam
56487,"Yeah, but this is different.",pam
56489,"I don't think so, but they put paint where I didn't want paint. So...",pam
56491,"Different colored paint. I wanted different colored paint in the spots where they put their paint. So, it just is... OK, the point is, these warehouse guys are vandals. And, they need to be stopped.",pam
56495,Yes. Thank you. Let's answer that question.,pam
56497,What? Come on guys. We need to figure out who did this and punish them. This isn't just about me. This is about all of us. This is our mural. Don't you see? How much we worked on this? How much time and energy? We put our heart and soul into this thing.,pam
56499,"Sure did. I was as surprised as you, but apparently, he is very passionate about public art.",pam
56500,"[as everyone begin to leave] No, no. Come on, guys. Don't go.",pam
56501,"Pam, I'll help you.",dwight
56502,You will?,pam
56503,"If there's anything I hate worse than art, it's crime.",dwight
56504,Thank you.,pam
56506,Yeah?,pam
56508,Great.,pam
56509,"I was hoping for a righteous mob, and I ended up with Dwight and Nellie. But, they both have a mob mentality. And, I'm pretty sure Dwight has a pitchfork in his car.",pam
56510,[enters quickly] You need my pitchfork?,dwight
56512,What is it? I have vengeance to exact.,dwight
56514,"Ah, I'm not interested.",dwight
56516,"If I get the deicing gig, it's not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics. [exits]",dwight
56521,"[in warehouse] I am handing out pieces of paper. On which, you will draw one human butt. What I do with said drawings, is no one's business but my own.",dwight
56523,"Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts.",dwight
56526,Yes. Or nipplous breasts. Perhaps.,dwight
56528,"Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts...",dwight
56530,"We need another approach. Um, we need to fine the weakest one and separate him from the group. [they notice Nate struggling with a box] Yeah. I think if we could get Nate alone, we could crack him.",pam
56531,We just need a pretense to talk to him. We could tell him that his mother is dying. That usually works on him. [holds up phone] Nate. Your mother is dying. [Nate reacts with grief],dwight
56532,"See, I feel bad about that.",pam
56533,It's all right. It's all right.,dwight
56535,No. She needs her rest again.,dwight
56537,"You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum.",dwight
56539,[interrupting] Tell us who defaced the mural!,pam
56541,All right. You can go. Give him his gum.,pam
56542,There's no gum. There never was any gum.,dwight
56550,"Nice job, man.",jim
56552,"[confused] What? [Darryl points at his thermos Jim has been using] Oh, man! I'm sorry about that.",jim
56554,"Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?",jim
56556,"Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that.",jim
56558,"No, no. If it's a big deal, it's a big deal.",jim
56560,No big deal.,jim
56562,"Honestly, I don't mind. [long, awkward pause until thermos is empty] Did you want me to wash it for you or...",jim
56564,[after tense pause] OK. Here ya go. [roughly hands Darryl his thermos],jim
56567,"[to Nellie] Maybe, maybe I could, could get the ball rolling. [Nellie nods] Um, Frank? Hi. Pam. Um, I am so sorry if I've done anything to offend you. I'm sure it isn't easy for you guys to have an upstairs person coming down in your space. So. Truly. If, if, I apologize. But enough about me. Your turn.",pam
56570,"Well, I didn't think that butt was funny.",pam
56572,What was that?,pam
56574,Whoa! Hey! That is not OK. What are you gonna do about that?,pam
56578,That sucked. He didn't apologize. There's no talking to that guy.,pam
56579,"Oh, your little feelings party didn't work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first.",dwight
56580,We should just take him down.,pam
56581,Wait. Are you saying...,dwight
56582,I'm saying we should go scorched earth on that guy's face.,pam
56583,"Normally, I find Pam to be a comforting, if unarousing, presence around the office. Like a well-watered fern. But, today, she has tapped into this vengeful, violent side. And I'm like, wow, Pam has kind of a good butt.",dwight
56584,He messed with something that was important to you. We need to mess with something that's important to him.,dwight
56585,Yes!,pam
56586,A little eye for an eye action.,dwight
56587,Yes!,pam
56588,Go all Hammurabi on this clown.,dwight
56589,We need an infiltrator.,pam
56590,I know just the man for the job. [looks at Clark],dwight
56591,Clark?,pam
56592,He even looks like a mole.,dwight
56600,Hey.,jim
56602,Yeah. Totally.,jim
56604,[after Darryl eyes him drinking from a thermos] It's mine. Don't worry.,jim
56606,I don't think you had to.,jim
56608,"I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?",jim
56610,That's not the point.,jim
56612,"No, I'm not making bread.",jim
56614,"Darryl, it doesn't matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make.",jim
56616,It's all good. Are we all good?,jim
56618,What's that cooler?,jim
56620,"Oh, crap. Were those yours?",jim
56621,[pulling Clark across the parking lot] I never want to see you working in the upstairs office again. Do you hear me?,dwight
56623,"Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.",dwight
56625,"Shh, shh.",pam
56627,Shh. Remember your lines.,pam
56629,Go move some paper!,dwight
56630,"[to Darryl on phone] Hey, you know that guy Frank who works in the warehouse?",pam
56632,OK. What does he like? What's important to him? Does he have like a favorite pair of boots or a lunch box or...,pam
56634,"Yeah, something like that.",pam
56636,"Oh, great! [to Dwight] His truck!",pam
56637,Great. Get the plate number.,dwight
56638,OK. [to Darryl] Do you know the plate... never mind. Why would you know that? And why would I be asking that?,pam
56639,So we know which truck to van...,dwight
56641,Yeah. I was kinda hoping you could. I gotta go. Bye. [to Dwight] Come on. [camera pans to Clark duct taped to a chair],pam
56654,I'm done. What are you... Is that supposed to be my mural?,pam
56655,"Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I'm drawing your mural on Frank's truck's butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita.",dwight
56656,"Aw, Dwight. That's really sweet.",pam
56657,Let's see yours.,dwight
56658,"Oh, no. Um, I, I'm embarrassed. It's stupid.",pam
56659,This is amazing! Frank! And he's leaving a trail of poops?,dwight
56660,Yeah. And he has saggy boobs.,pam
56661,I saw that. That's great!,dwight
56662,Yeah. I feel better.,pam
56663,"Good. I'm glad you feel better. This has been a wonderful day. I have to say, I like hanging out with a vengeful bitch.",dwight
56664,"I know. You miss Angela, don't you?",pam
56665,Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis.,dwight
56666,"I got back at Frank in the most fitting way possible. With my art. The paints are water-based. It's gonna come off with a hose. But, I think the lesson will last a very...",pam
56668,"No, you had no right!",pam
56670,So? You started it!,pam
56673,Whoa.,pam
56684,"Well, I'm gonna say something to the producers.",pam
56686,"You shouldn't be fired. I mean, you were just protecting me.",pam
56688,Forget about my mural. It's stupid.,pam
56690,"It's crazy. Brian, I'm so sorry.",pam
56692,"Thanks, Brian.",pam
56694,"Wow. This whole Philly thing has been so much fun that I may have lost sight of what really matters. I mean, having fun is not nearly as important as being good to the people who you really care about. I mean, that's just 'Roommates 101'.",jim
56696,Oh. Oh!,jim
56698,[imitating game announcer] You win. [Darryl throws empty can on floor] How good did that feel?,jim
56700,[to Jim] Hey. I feel so lucky we're in the same city for Valentine's Day.,pam
56701,"It's like magic. Or, it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.",jim
56702,[makes magic trick hand gesture] Alakazam!,pam
56703,"By the way, they do need an extra day next week.",jim
56704,"And, poof! He disappears. [Jim snaps, playing along]",pam
56715,"[knocks on Andy's door, then pretends to answer as Andy] Come in.",dwight
56716,"[talking to Andy's empty chair] Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract.",dwight
56717,"[pretending to be Andy] I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo.",dwight
56718,"I really like Andy these days. He's pretend and he does exactly as I tell him to. All that will change when real Andy comes back tomorrow. [thinks for a moment] Unless he comes back as pretend Dwight. In which case, we're in for an epic, confusing showdown.",dwight
56734,[eating] These are gross.,pam
56735,They are terrible.,jim
56736,"Oh, hey, don't fill up on chocolates. I made us a lunch reservation at State Street Grill.",pam
56737,Oh my god. That's so romantic.,jim
56738,It's with Brian and Alyssa.,pam
56739,Oh my god. That's less romantic.,jim
56740,"I know. But we should go. We need to thank him for, you know, saving my life.",pam
56741,"Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That's good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?",jim
56742,That sounds nice.,pam
56743,"I'm very excited to see Brian. Brian's a great guy. And Pam and I have gotten really close to he and his wife, Alyssa over the years. And he got fired for protecting my wife from a jerk in the warehouse. I'm sorry, but you know him. He's a good guy.",jim
56759,"[enters restaurant with Pam] Hey, Brian.",jim
56761,Sorry we're late.,pam
56763,"Ha,ha,ha, yeah OK.",pam
56764,What?,jim
56765,He's on a no carb thing. Supposedly.,pam
56766,Oh.,jim
56768,Yeah.,pam
56769,"Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.",jim
56771,"Well, my dad can't hear a thing. You could boom his whole life for him.",pam
56773,Where's Alyssa?,pam
56775,Oh.,pam
56777,[to Andy's empty chair] I have yet another sales order for you to sign.,dwight
56778,[acting as Andy] Why thank you Mr. Schrute. I don't know how you do it. You're a god. Rick-a-dick-dick-doo.,dwight
56779,"[in his office doorway, bearded and unkept] Hi Dwight.",andy
56780,You're back. [surveys Andy] And you're disgusting.,dwight
56782,"Well, well, well, look who it is.",andy
56784,"I guess I can cancel my order from Zappos.com because, oh, the loafers have arrived.",andy
56786,Hey! Sweetheart! [approaches Erin] I have missed you so much.,andy
56788,[attempting to hug Erin as she resists] I have been dreaming of this moment.,andy
56792,"Well, Valentine's surprise for Erin.  Hello? Super romantic. And I got you something. [removes wooden instruments from bag] Oh, it's a couple of pieces of bamboo. Big deal, right? No. These are musical instruments. It's so we can play island music together. Cause I have this. [removes g??iro and begins playing and singing] Clop the cloppers. Yeah, clop 'em. It's called Bembe. [sings while Kevin echoes]",andy
56793,"Hey, Burning Man, if it's not selling out too much, you might want to throw on a tie. David Wallace is gonna be here in an hour.",dwight
56794,"Obviously, that's why I'm here. I mean, I came back early to surprise Erin. Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart. [tries to embrace Erin but she begins playing cloppers] But, I'm just saying, I'm also excited about the Wallace meeting.",andy
56796,"No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months. [Andy stalls] Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months?",dwight
56797,"I have no idea. I don't know what he knows or doesn't know. But we've been in touch the whole time. I mean, it's not hard to get high-speed internet in Turks de Caicos, people. It's in every Bembe cafe.",andy
56799,Question. Where's Jim?,andy
56801,For two hours? Really?,andy
56803,"If the shoe fits. [plays g??iro and sings, Kevin echoes]",andy
56805,"Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight.",jim
56807,[obviously flustered] Yeah.,pam
56808,What?,jim
56810,Crying?,jim
56811,I noticed that you landed the Scranton White Pages account. That is tremendous.,andy
56812,Thank you.,dwight
56813,And you sold it to Jan too.,andy
56814,Yes!,dwight
56815,I mean... I'm impressed.,andy
56816,[laughing together] Yeah!,dwight
56817,"Well, there's one problem. Couldn't help but notice that you offered a price point that was not approved by the head office. So... gotta run that stuff by me, Dwight.",andy
56818,You were on a boat.,dwight
56819,I was...,andy
56820,On a boat.,dwight
56821,That...,andy
56822,In the ocean.,dwight
56823,OK. The issue is that you need to run this stuff by me. Coolio? Are we coolio? [Dwight resists] Just say the word 'coolio'.,andy
56824,I'm not gonna say it.,dwight
56825,Say it.,andy
56826,Not a word.,dwight
56827,Coolio.,andy
56828,No! [Andy makes a call] What do you think you're doing?,dwight
56829,Just gonna call the Scranton White Pages and clear this right up.,andy
56830,Don't you dare! Andy!,dwight
56832,"Hey, Jan. Nard dog here.",andy
56834,I was just looking over the paperwork. I found a little hiccup.,andy
56836,Yeah. It appears my employee offered you a price that he was not authorized to.,andy
56838,[whispers] Coolio.,dwight
56840,Coolio. Coolio.,dwight
56841,"No. No, no, no Jan I think you misunderstood.",andy
56843,Coolio.,dwight
56844,"It, it's, it's actually just an issue...",andy
56846,"No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything.",dwight
56847,"Jan, I don't know what he's talking about but...",andy
56849,"Well, ah, ah...",andy
56850,"Please Ja, Ja... [Jan hangs up]",dwight
56851,Aw! That was not how I had hoped that would go.,andy
56852,"[approaching Accounting] Hey, everybody, great job. [to Angela] Listen, we're a smidge behind on my paychecks.",andy
56854,All right. Thank you very much. [examines checks] Looking good. [after noticing something on Angela's desk] Who's that little fella?,andy
56856,"Wow, that's wonderful!",andy
56858,Uh-huh.,andy
56860,"Uh-huh... [after awkward pause] Uh-huh. [Angela hands him the bonus check] Thank you. Great. Well, we're all up to speed.",andy
56861,Two seconds of the turd dog and he loses the biggest sale this branch has ever seen.,dwight
56864,"God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.",dwight
56865,"I'd like to rat out Andy. Unfortunately, I have a bit of a boy-who-cried-wolf dynamic with David Wallace. Except, instead of a boy, I'm a man. And instead of a wolf, I cried genetically-engineered monster wolf.",dwight
56871,"Fine! The state he's in, Wallace will take one look at him and probably fire him anyway.",dwight
56872,"[appears approaching group, shaved and in a suit] What's going on in here, dirty players? Let's get back to busting some paper rhymes. Come on. [singing] Who's that girl? Who's that girl? It's Andy! [resumes talking] All right. Back to work.",andy
56873,"OK, I can tell you're mad at me. Do you wanna just, um, I don't know, tell me why?",pam
56874,"I don't know. I thought that was a little weird. You told me Brian got fired for the whole warehouse thing. And you intentionally left out a kind of major, intimate detail. I don't know, Pam, I guess I just feel like a chump. Who knows less about his marriage than the sound guy.",jim
56875,I didn't tell you about the crying because I didn't want you to know how upset I was. Because it would've stressed you out and you're always saying how much you don't want more stress.,pam
56876,"Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you.",jim
56877,It's not Brian's fault.,pam
56878,"No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it.",jim
56879,OK.,pam
56880,I need you guys to tell me all the highlights from the last three months in case David asks. Just a few things I could sprinkle into conversation. Any big sales or office gossip.,andy
56881,"Well, we had the Scranton White Pages.",dwight
56882,"Not helpful. Let's stay positive, people. OK?",andy
56884,"Hey! David! How are ya? Ah, we were just having our weekly round table where we motivate each other. Not gonna lie, I get as much out of it as they do.",andy
56886,Thank you.,andy
56888,Great!,andy
56890,[whispering] We had to let a warehouse guy go?!,andy
56892,[interrupting] ' lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.,dwight
56893,What?!,andy
56894,Yeah.,dwight
56895,There was a fire in the warehouse?,andy
56896,The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers.,dwight
56898,"This is what I'm talking about! This would be good to know. All right, what else?",andy
56900,What?!,andy
56902,No kidding?,andy
56904,Wow. Go Kathy. She's like 50.,andy
56906,"Good, good. What else?",andy
56907,"Who knew the balloon game would be so lucrative? And thank god, right? We needed the income after the fire.",andy
56909,The warehouse fire. Weren't you just down there? It's like burnt to ashes.,andy
56911,"[catches on to the ruse] I am speaking metaphorically, of course. You know I have lots of irons in quote-unquote fire. Well, that's one of them. You know, making sure that the warehouse logistics is a well-oiled, properly-stoked fire.",andy
56913,I think you'll agree I explained that pretty well.,andy
56915,Thank you.,andy
56918,"Yeah, I guess.",andy
56920,"Yeah, it just sort of sounds like noise to me now. You think I need a new fish?",andy
56922,What?,andy
56924,"OK, I get it. You're unhappy. I've been gone a long time and we lost a little bit of juju. But, you and me, we have a future. There is a lot of love here.",andy
56926,"On your side. But there's tons on my side. It's gushing. We're just out of sync right now. But that's just timing, it's timing. I mean, my parents lasted 38, 40 years. They were never happy at the same time.",andy
56928,"I mean, what do we have left? 35, maybe 40 years? If we're lucky. I mean, I have spent a lot of time in the sun.",andy
56930,"I'm gonna be a prune in like, 3 years.",andy
56932,"I know you may not be feeling love for me right now but, if you fake it, I won't be able to tell the difference. So, I'll feel good. And then, eventually, maybe, you'll actually start to love me again.",andy
56934,Yes. [hugs Erin] Come on. Totally.,andy
56935,You know what? Maybe we should cancel that bottle of wine tonight.,jim
56936,Oh?,pam
56937,"Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?",jim
56938,Are you sure?,pam
56939,I just feel like we're gonna fight.,jim
56940,[obviously hurt] Yeah.,pam
56941,So... how 'bout let's not?,jim
56942,OK. [they begin to leave],pam
56943,"Oh, um. [pulls item from bag and hands to Pam] Happy Valentine's Day. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it.",jim
56944,"[sees it's a drawing of hers, framed] Wow. I didn't know you kept this.",pam
56945,"Yeah, yeah.",jim
56946,Thank you.,pam
56947,No problem.,jim
56948,I don't think you should go to Philly tonight. I think that you should stay and I think we should fight.,pam
56949,You really wanna fight on Valentine's Day?,jim
56950,"Yeah, I do.",pam
56951,"OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.",jim
56961,"I resent that. I, I never lied to you.",andy
56963,And all was good in Scranton PA that day.,andy
56965,Oscar says 'hi' all the time. He says all kinds of greetings. 'Hi' 'Hello' 'Hola' You're telling me you've never heard Oscar say 'hi'?,andy
56967,But you're calling me a liar.,andy
56969,"By the way, that reminds me, I want to ask you about some of the lies you've been telling lately.",andy
56971,"Oh, here we go, January seventh 2013. [Reading from phone] 'Hey Andy, all's well. Been meaning to make it down there but my wife's sick.' Well, which is it?! Is all well or is your wife sick?! BUSTED!",andy
56973,This has been a really tough time.,andy
56975,Yeah.,andy
56977,"Erin just dumped me and I can't remember any of the aha moments I had on the boat, and I know it sounds weird to say but I really miss my beard.",andy
56979,It was like a security blan-,andy

56991,Vanilla. [David looks confused] Vanilla Ice. It was a band.,andy
56992,Good morning.,andy
56994,"And how are you on this fine- [chokes up, runs into office and slams door pulling the blinds closed]",andy
56995,"[Crying] Ok, we ready? [cut] Don't use that part. Last week, Erin told me that our relationship would be proceeding without me. Now I have to see her everyday at work. Which is...brutal. When people say office relationships are a good idea, they never talk about what might happen if you break up.",andy
56996,[Moaning from office] Ahhh! Oooooh! ahh,andy
56997,He sounds like a wounded animal.,pam
57001,Ok. [Andy continues moaning],pam

57004,"Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It's um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is. [laughs] I'm sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note.",pam
57005,"[on phone] No, don't just let her eat the grass, she'll puke it right up. OK, just put out two bowls and see which feed she prefers. I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your precious time, Mose, but she's your aunt too. Fine. I'll see what I can do.",dwight
57006,[Jumps out from behind vending machine] I need you.,dwight
57008,"And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes.",dwight
57010,"It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs.",dwight
57012,"You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was 'poisoned' by Aunt Shirley.",dwight
57014,"Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.",dwight
57016,Thank you.,dwight
57018,"Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out-",dwight

57033,How dare you?,dwight
57034,I'm still the boss!,andy
57036,The answer is yes.,andy
57038,Are they from you?,andy
57040,"Well then, I don't want them. You can keep 'em. In fact, you can keep that big blue Nautica sweater, I know how much you love it.",andy
57042,"Nope, I insist upon it. It's an awesome sweater. Some great memories tied up in that thing.",andy
57044,I don't want to talk about work right now.,andy
57046,Then I want my big blue sweater back.,andy
57050,She got rid of it. My blue sweater. What is that about?,andy
57052,"Stay! We are in the bro-zone layer. Ok? Nard dog, Plop and Clarker Posey, AKA Clarkwork Orange. Here's the sitch: Erin dumped me, natch. But she got rid of my blue sweater, which was her favorite. Is she moving on a little fast, or am I being a total psycho? Plop, you go first.",andy
57054,"Survey says: ENH! Doesn't make me feel better at all. Zero Clark Thirty, what do you got?",andy
57056,Last night I ordered a pizza by myself and I ate it over the sink like a rat.,andy

57068,OK,dwight

57074,"Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?",dwight
57076,Ok.,dwight
57078,"Yeah, trust me.",dwight
57080,"It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.",dwight
57082,"Why doesn't Erin seem sad? Has she found someone new or something? And if so, why hasn't she told me? Is she trying to spare my feelings? During breakups, the mind goes to some crazy dark places.",andy
57084,"I'm not snooping, there's just some crud on her screen.",andy
57091,"Uh, hello! Who's snooping on who now?",andy
57095,"Everyone please, just-",andy
57100,Oh my god.,andy
57105,"Darryl, Clark, Toby, Kevin, Plop. Take a knee. Alright, you guys are gonna think I'm psycho again. Uh, couldn't shake this feeling that Erin's dating someone so I looked at her phone.",andy
57107,Too late. I found out she's been texting a guy named Pete. Does anybody know a Pete?,andy
57112,[whispers] hello!,pam

57132,Bye.,pam
57134,"In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.",dwight
57136,"Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.",dwight
57138,"No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.",dwight
57140,"Come on in. Have a seat. Uh, thanks for coming in, I just gotta get something off my chest. I just got some really weird news and uh, I'm just gonna come out and say it. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and it turns out I contracted [reading computer screen] shlmydia...from Erin. And it's incurable. Pretty lame huh?",andy
57142,I knew it!,andy
57144,You and Erin are fuhhhhhhherraaaaa!,andy
57146,No overlap? Great. Good. Wow. This is suddenly so easy. Guess what? You're fired!,andy
57148,"Yeah. You. Are. Fired! One of the perks of being boss. I can fire anyone who steals my girlfriend. And wow, that turns out to be you. Yup. Sorry. [singing] So you had a bad day-",andy

57196,Give it a whirl.,dwight
57199,I need you to hose my aunt.,dwight
57201,OK you are useless.,dwight
57203,Give me the hose!,dwight
57205,Ahh! OK!,dwight
57207,Yes ma'am.,dwight
57223,[Mouths] Oh my god.,pam
57224,"Thank you! Thanks, thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. You guys are supposed to have my back. OK? Instead you let a guy named Plop steal my girlfriend.",andy
57226,Ugh.,andy
57229,That doesn't matter. Ok? What matters is that I am hurt! Deep hurt inside of me. I don't care if they're Romeo and freaking Juliet! I feel like the guy that Juliet dated before Romeo. Probably her boss. And guess what? Juliet's boss also had feelings.,andy
57231,What?!,andy
57233,[wipes nose] Sorry.,andy
57235,My whole life is a booger bubble!,andy
57237,"Yeah, I've seen that with my kids. Um, it is tiny, but I've actually been commissioned by the City of Scranton to paint a mural-",pam

57243,"Yeah, the um, the city commissioned me to do the-",pam
57245,Yes.,pam
57247,"Two children, yes.",pam
57250,Kinda painful to chat with you Pete. Ever since the old one-two punch to my scrotum pole. Translation: penis. Translation? My manhood.,andy
57252,"Great advice. Thank you, you can leave now.",andy
57254,Awesome perspective. Thanks for butting in.,andy
57260,"Yeah, so life gives you lemons and you've just gotta eat them, rinds and all. And if you don't want to eat them? Your ex-girlfriend will shove them down your throat with the help of her hunky new boyfriend. So that's fun.",andy
57262,I am not pr-,pam
57264,"Pregnant, no.",pam
57266,Wow.,pam
57268,I'm sorry I thought this job was for the position of office manager.,pam

57288,"Hey, how'd the interview go?",jim
57289,"Oh my gosh, wait until you. This guy was unbelievable. Ok so-",pam
57290,"I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in.",jim
57291,Eight? Really?,pam
57292,"I'll make it worth your while, I promise.",jim
57293,"Sure. I mean, it's Philly. I can kill four hours. So uh, yeah. I'll see you at eight.",pam
57294,"Alright, love you.",jim
57295,Love you.,pam
57328,Hi.,andy
57330,"Hi, how's it going?",andy
57332,Wow this sure is intense. Having to share a workspace with someone you used to get it on with?,andy
57334,Awkward.,andy
57336,[high pitched] Really uncomfortable situation.,andy
57338,"It's alright Pete, you can handle it. I mean we all just gotta 'move on'. Ain't that right professor lecture much? Uh, question. How's that medicine taste? Your own flavored? Is it just me or have these tables turned? Hmm. Hmm. [leaves]",andy
57349,And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.,dwight
57351,By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?,dwight
57353,Would you like the stink sack?,dwight
57355,"No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack.",dwight
57360,Hello?,pam
57361,Hey! Back here.,jim
57362,"Oh, wow. Seriously? Oh my gosh, is that champagne?",pam
57363,"Si, senor.",jim
57364,"Oh, Jim I should have told you I didn't get the job.",pam
57365,Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright?,jim
57366,"Oh, yeah. I'm more than alright. There's just nothing to celebrate.",pam
57367,Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.,jim
57368,[laughs] You're very quick on your feet. I remember you. Funny.,pam
57369,"Alright. So, tell me all about it.",jim
57370,"Ok. Well, gosh. Thank you for your help today. Your perspective was very useful. Thank you.",dwight
57372,"Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse.",dwight
57374,"Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey.",dwight
57376,I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you.,dwight
57378,Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine.,dwight
57382,"Hey, love turds. Conference room, now.",andy
57383,Thank you all for coming in. Just wanted to check in. How is everyone's day?,andy
57385,"Really? Hmm. That's interesting. Because Erin and Pete thought it wouldn't be weird at all. Why do you think it was weird, Gabe? Maybe because you and Erin used to be an item?",andy
57389,"And Alice, uh, I understand you once dumped Pete, ouch.",andy
57395,"We'll get to that. Gabe, did Erin ever tell you that she loves you?",andy
57427,"Alright, yes. That is a legitimate question. Does making Erin and Pete feel bad make me feel better? [Erin & Gabe and Alice & Pete argue in background] Yeah. Yeah, it does.",andy
57428,"So, imagine like the real estate version of Michael Scott and that was this guy. He did half the interview as Ace Ventura.",pam
57429,Tell me about the cologne. How much?,jim
57430,"Oh, uh, entire bottle. At least.",pam
57431,You're definitely hoarding this by the way.,jim
57432,Guess what poster he had on his wall?,pam
57433,Austin Powers.,jim
57434,MmMm.,pam
57435,Ferris Bueller.,jim
57436,MmMm. You're getting colder.,pam
57437,Not Night at the Roxbury.,jim
57438,[laughs] No. The Odd Life of Timothy Green.,pam
57439,"I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?",jim
57440,"I don't know, but it's interesting right?",pam
57441,It's fascinating.,jim
57442,He said he can't help but tear up when he looks at it. It's like right next to his desk. He must look at it twenty times a day.,pam
57443,"That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right?",jim
57444,Mmhm.,pam
57445,"So, next interview has to be better.",jim
57446,I don't know.,pam
57447,What do you mean? Of course it will. You're amazing.,jim
57448,"I know. It's just even if it was, a great boss and a great job, I just, I don't know, I don't know if I want, um, I don't know if I want this.",pam
57449,[long pause] Huh. This is a little out of left field.,jim
57450,"Is it? I just, I liked our life in Scranton.",pam
57451,And I have started a business in Philadelphia. [Pam shrugs],jim
57461,[as elevator door closes] Hold it!,dwight
57464,I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died.,dwight
57465,"Oh, Dwight. I'm so sorry. Were you guys close?",pam
57466,"I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.",dwight
57467,My actual mother was very cold and distant. I'd say she was the closest thing I had to an aunt.,dwight
57468,My condolences.,jim
57469,Keep them.,dwight
57470,"OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?",jim
57471,"In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil.",dwight
57476,Excuse me?,dwight
57478,OK. That's not... [tosses red dirt in Oscar's face],dwight
57480,[as Dwight prepares to throw dirt in his face] I'm sure... I'm sure she's in a better place.,jim
57481,I really hope so. [unexpectedly tosses dirt in Pam's face],dwight
57482,OK. [as Dwight mixes coffee with dirt in his hand] This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.,jim
57483,I miss her so much.,dwight
57484,OK.,jim
57485,You know? [Dwight screams and throws dirt ball at Jim],dwight
57487,Zeke.,dwight
57490,Are you going?,dwight
57492,[simultaneously with Zeke] Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.,dwight
57494,Get...,dwight
57495,"[at the grave site, to Oscar] What are you doing here?",dwight
57497,"[smirking] Oh, yeah.",dwight
57499,"Jeb, my brother.",dwight
57501,Uh-huh.,dwight
57506,' bad.,pam
57512,"Todd, you're just saying insults in the form of an apology.",pam
57514,I think it's called 'Nibbles'.,pam
57516,"Hey, hey, guys. Wait. Before we accept these cupcakes, I think we need to have a conversation privately in the conference room. Don't eat the cupcake.",pam
57519,Doesn't matter. It's a cemetery.,dwight
57521,"Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies.",dwight
57523,"Well, thank god they're not because we don't want to make zombies.",dwight
57526,You had black hair and then gray hair.,dwight
57530,"You were late. So, what am I supposed to do?",dwight
57540,"[to his nephew Cameron] Hello, little man. Haven't seen you in a few years. [after a weak handshake] What is this? Oh, god. [after a truck with many girls in the bed pulls up] Henry.",dwight
57542,I see Esther's back in town.,dwight
57544,Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.,dwight
57546,"Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens.",dwight
57548,OK.,dwight
57552,"So, let's get it going.",dwight
57555,"We Schrutes don't need some Harvard doctor to tell us who's alive and who's dead. But, there was an unlucky streak of burying some heavy sleepers. And, when grave robbers discovered some scratch marks on the inside of some of the coffins, we decided to make sure that our dead were completely dead. Out of kindness.",dwight
57557,I don't think we should eat Packers' cupcakes. We can't give him the satisfaction.,pam
57559,"We can't let him buy our forgiveness with cupcakes. He was awful to us. And, he still is. How much is a cupcake? $2.50? Is that the price of our dignity?",pam
57568,Would any of you be saying any of this if the cupcakes were from Supermart?,pam
57571,"So, it really is just about the cupcakes.",pam
57572,"Wow, you're right. It is just about the cupcakes.",andy
57577,[agreeing with Shirley] Thank you.,dwight
57580,"I can't stand the fact that Jeb is a pot farmer. He could've grown anything. Anything in the world. He used to talk about growing a peanut-grape hybrid. One plant, one sandwhich.",dwight
57586,Let's do this. Let's run Aunt Shirley's farm. I'm in. Boom.,dwight
57588,Of course you are.,dwight
57590,Oh my god.,dwight
57594,You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer.,dwight
57597,"You will say 'yes' on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say 'yes', one. Yes.",dwight
57601,OK.,dwight
57603,[counts down in French],dwight
57605,Oui.,dwight
57607,"[while everyone is gathered playing and singing 'Sons & Daughters'] People underestimate the power of nostalgia. If baseball can use it to get people to care about that worthless sport, then I can use it to get my siblings to care about the farm. Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses. Second only to the neck.",dwight
57614,"Kevin, um, let's think of something to distract us. Uh, like the movie Skyfall. You loved the movie Skyfall, right?",pam
57617,Yes. He was a good spy.,pam
57621,"Guys, I'm proud of us. I think we did the right thing. [after noticing Angela easting cupcake] Hey!",pam
57623,[as others eat] Wait!,pam
57625,"No, no. It's the principle of the thing.",pam
57626,"[exits office, chewing] Oh my god. I forgive him so much. [Kevin begins making choking sounds] Whoa, is he choking?",andy
57630,"Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens.",dwight
57632,"Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit.",dwight
57634,If you want.,dwight
57636,"This? No. That'd be cool, though. It's for milking.",dwight
57638,Did you just ask me if this was a cow?,dwight
57640,Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?,dwight
57642,"Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy?",dwight
57644,"OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything?",dwight
57646,"Good morning, Erin.",pam
57648,"Hey, everybody. Um, I decided to eat my cupcake. I thought about it last night. I talked to Jim. I talked to my sister. And, I think that, as long as Todd Packer doesn't know, it's OK.",pam
57650,Phyllis!,pam
57652,No!,pam
57655,Oh my god! Is everyone OK?,pam
57661,"Last night? Oh, god, um, I don't know. [cuts to him arm wrestling Kevin] Na, nothing really. Kevin?",andy
57663,"I'm not, a... I'm just. I don't know. [cuts to him spinning a plate like a record and Kevin dancing] Oh. Gosh. I actually. It is hard to recall. Um. [cuts to he and Kevin sitting on a table touching each others face] Pretty normal night.",andy
57665,Yeah. I didn't see you last night at all. [cuts to him dancing by prostrate Kevin],andy
57667,Wow. He is officially the worst human being.,pam
57669,"But, Kevin that's...",pam
57674,"Ooh, red velvet. I should apologize too.",jim
57678,"It. [to Fannie] That kid doesn't put in some farm time, he's gonna stay like that.",dwight
57681,"Phyllis has gotten into audio books and lately she's been listening to 50 Shades of Grey.  Which, if you don't know what it is, it's a book about um...",pam
57683,Yeah.,pam
57684,"[Phyllis rocks her chair into his provocatively] Seriously. Ugh. Ok, this is unacceptable. It's officially a hostile work environment.",dwight
57687,"Be careful. I pulled my mom's dog off a pillow once, and I got bit.",pam
57690,What?,andy
57691,Phyllis is masturbating. In the office right now as we speak.,dwight
57696,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Why is Phyllis so aroused?",andy
57697,She's listening to 50 Shades of Grey.,pam
57698,Well there you go. That's muy caliente.,andy
57699,"OK, you are useless. I'll take care of this. [walks out of Andy's office and dumps water on Phyllis]",dwight

58951,"I'm letting you all off half an hour early to view the documentary. So you can make it up to me by working an extra half an hour tomorrow, or a minute extra for the rest of the month.",dwight
58955,This is really huge. This is like the March on Washington but for a singing show. Can you imagine if Martin Luther King were here? And sang 'I Dreamed a Dream' from Les Mis? With that baritone? That would be historic.,andy
58957,No!,andy
58959,"No, this is my time! You don't belt on my time! I belt on my time.",andy
58961,[vocalizing over her] Casey Dean!,andy
58963,Yeah.,andy
58965,Andy. What's yours?,andy
58979,Not now! Private time!,dwight
58980,I love Star Wars as much as the next guy',jim
58981,"Hey, hey! Seriously? [holds up Battlestar Galactica model box]",dwight
58982,"My god, I'm so sorry. Well this might make up for it: I think I have found an enormous source of overlooked PFN.",jim
58983,"Which is, of course'",dwight
58984,Potential future nonsense.,jim
58985,"Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.",dwight
58986,I'm gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. You've got a regional manager.,jim
58987,The power source.,dwight
58988,"Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager.",jim
58989,"A loyal, but bungling apostle.",dwight
58990,But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?,jim
58991,Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.,dwight
58992,Exactly.,jim
58993,"I'd have to get some more wire and string, but it's doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?",dwight
58994,"Yeah, right. I mean, unless they're willing to pass some tests.",jim
58995,I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?,dwight
58996,"Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?",jim
58997,"That doesn't sound crazy, Jim. That's the sanest thing I've ever heard.",dwight
58999,"Hmm? Um, uh, locking in my starting note. A 440.",andy
59001,"A cappella is all about pitch, and I am nothing if not a total pitch bitch.",andy
59005,There's a mole?,andy
59007,What mole? What are you talking about? I already forgot about it.,andy
59009,Yeah! Pour some Sugar Ray on me!,andy
59011,I don't know where it came from.,andy
59013,"Yeah. Yeah, it felt good. It felt funny.",andy
59015,"I did, I felt it.",andy
59017,What are you so excited about?,pam
59018,Nothing.,jim
59019,What are you up to?,pam
59020,"Members of the office, hear ye.",jim
59021,"That means ye, Plop!",dwight
59023,We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?,dwight
59025,Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.,jim
59027,Nice.,pam
59028,"You'll always have the upper hand, when you've got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.",dwight
59029,"This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but that's for fueling only. No savoring.",jim
59030,"Wow, the honor. God, I envy them.",dwight
59031,He envies you.,jim
59032,"You don't need to repeat right now, when I'm saying it.",dwight
59033,Alright.,jim
59034,"By 2:00, Dwight will chose himself to be assistant to his own assistant, me.",jim
59039,"A good assistant knows what their superior is thinking before they even think it. Meredith, what number am I thinking of right now?",jim
59041,"985,000,000,000,017.00",jim
59042,"Not even close, Meredith. Come on!",dwight
59043,"Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?",jim
59044,Theme song from Saved by the Bell.,pam
59045,"Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.",jim
59046,"Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each other's minds. You're trying to give your wife this job.",dwight
59047,"That's exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?",jim
59049,"Ew, the exact opposite, actually.",jim
59051,Come on.,jim
59053,Whoa. How did you know that I was gonna',jim
59055,"Challenge number two, protocol. Clark?",jim
59057,Do you want a corn dog?,jim
59059,"We'll see. You are an assistant who's just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.",jim
59061,"No, no, no, no! You don't read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. There's no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries don't have diplomatic relations.",dwight
59062,Uncanny.,jim
59064,"Great, more screen time for the war vet. All you gotta do is risk your life for this country and everyone goes gaga for you.",andy
59066,What?,andy
59068,Is this a show about the resiliency of the human spirit? Or is it a show about singing?,andy
59070,Me too. Hold my place in line.,andy
59072,They want feel-good stories? Wait until they get a good feel of me.,andy
59076,"Darryl, hey.",pam
59078,"Cool, are you coming back to say hi?",pam
59080,Aha. How's Athlead?,pam
59082,Wow.,pam
59084,He says he doesn't want to.,pam
59086,"Well, he seems really happy being back here at Dunder Mifflin.",pam
59088,That's what he says.,pam
59090,"An assistant brings their boss coffee with speed and dexterity. But an assistant to the assistant has a thousand times more to prove, am I right?",jim
59091,A thousand times more.,dwight
59093,"Phyllis! Grab both these coffees, double-fist it, and head through this obstacle course.",jim
59095,"Yeah. It's real. It's the only way you'll learn. OK, and go ahead. [Phyllis carefully makes her way through the obstacle course] Oh, god, nice! She's through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!",jim
59096,"[over Jim] No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously?",dwight
59097,Look at that form.,jim
59098,"[running over and taking the coffee cups from Phyllis] Oh, god, this is pathetic! The boss needs his coffee! [races through obstacles, spilling coffee] Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Here's your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah!",dwight
59099,Uncanny. [everyone applauds],jim
59113,"You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thing'none of these people are good enough.",jim
59114,I know.,dwight
59115,"What I'm about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing I've ever said.",jim
59116,"Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-",dwight
59117,Is-,jim
59118,Me.,dwight
59119,The new assistant to the assistant to the regional manager is Dwight K. Schrute.,jim
59120,Yes! [weak applause] Thank you.,dwight
59121,"I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one. [Dwight awkwardly squats] That's it. You look really, really good.",jim
59122,"Okay, from now on, anyone who needs to speak to me has got to go through me first, all right?",dwight
59123,Hey.,jim
59124,Hey.,pam
59125,You all right? What's going on?,jim
59126,Are you happy?,pam
59127,"Yes, I'm happy.",jim
59128,"No, I know that you're, like, happy and, like, you had fun today.",pam
59129,Yeah.,jim
59130,And that was fun. But what about a year from now?,pam
59131,What?,jim
59132,What about five years from now?,pam
59133,Pam.,jim
59134,"Because I'm so glad you're back, baby, but I'm just'I was talking to Darryl, and he was talking about the trip, and I just feel like you're giving up so much.",pam
59135,"This was my decision, not yours.",jim
59136,Okay.,pam
59137,You didn't force me.,jim
59138,I kind of forced you to do it.,pam
59139,You did not force me to do this.,jim
59140,"Yes, I did.",pam
59141,I don't know how else to tell you.,jim
59142,I'm afraid that you're gonna resent me and I'm afraid that',pam
59143,Resent you?,jim
59144,This is not enough for you and I'm afraid that I'm not enough for you.,pam
59145,Is that really what you think?,jim
59146,"Not enough? I don't know how else to explain it to her, so, you know what? I know it's against the rules but I'm gonna need a favor from you guys.",jim
59181,Smart baby. That's the most flavorful bond.,dwight
59182,"Hey, what's goin' on over here? Some sort of singing competition for the young'uns?",andy
59184,"No, it's me, Andy!",andy
59186,"No, no, no. I'm wearing makeup.",andy
59188,"Oh, I took out my lifts.",andy
59190,"Yeah, unlike Andy Bernard, this character is my real height.",andy
59193,"Oink the pigs, that is very important. [watching Phillip]",dwight
59195,The way that boy looks at the Galactica is precisely the way I look at the Galactica. And he eats the same kind of paper I do. Hmm.,dwight
59196,"[puts his grandmother's ring away] Thank you, Esther.",dwight
59198,"You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?",jim
59199,I need you to perform a test.,dwight
59200,Perform a test.,jim
59201,On an innocent baby.,dwight
59202,"Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so I'm gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, don't worry, he's the best in the biz.",jim
59203,Damn straight.,dwight
59204,Unless you think he can't handle it.,jim
59205,"Hey, he can handle it.",dwight
59206,All right.,jim
59210,"Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, there's no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.",dwight
59211,He does have a gift.,pam
59214,Okay. [takes Phillip who immediately stops crying] You ever been in a manager's office before?,dwight
59215,"Phillip, you wanna play a little game? It's called 'Schrute or Consequences.' You're gonna choose one of these two things. A check for a million dollars, or this dirty old beet. Yuck, pew! Which will it be? Money or the beet?",dwight
59217,"Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but you're no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.",dwight
59220,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?",andy
59222,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't do that. You can't do that, we've all been waiting.",andy
59224,I am going in there! Don't',andy
59226,Don't'don't',andy
59228,Don't touch me.,andy
59232,That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when he's being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.,dwight
59234,"[interrupting contestant singing 'Beautiful' by Christina Aguilera] Hi. You're still here. Oh, thank god. Clay Aiken, Santigold, Aaron Rodgers. You're like, my three favorite people ever.",andy
59236,"[shushing contestant] Sweetheart, you're amazing, okay? You're obviously gonna be on the show, so it's someone else's turn now. Yeah, go ahead. All right, [old man voice] my name is Ezra Cornell and I'm just a kindly old fellow with a song in my heart.",andy
59238,"Busted. Yes, got it. All right. Tried to get your attention with tricks, but you just want to hear me sing, I respect that.",andy
59241,"Nope! Can't end like this. Slept in my car last night, quit my job, burned all my bridges. I went to the bathroom on my boss's car. And I did unspeakable things with Carla Fern.",andy
59243,"That's'that's what'yeah. Okay, all right, well, here's the song. [singing] Far above Cayuga's waters, with her waves so blue, stands our noble alma mater'",andy
59245,Are you insane? It's the Cornell fight song.,andy
59247,You didn't let me finish. That's not fair.,andy
59249,"Wow, you guys are really mean. I guess that's the show. Let me try a different song, okay?",andy
59251,"[singing] Hey, hobo man, hey, dapper Dan, you both got your style, but, brother, you're never fully dressed without a smile. [falters at the judges' reactions] Yeah. Your clothes may be beau brummelly'",andy
59253,Oh I can so just sit here and cry!,andy
59254,[addressing camera after opening envelope on his desk] Thank you.,jim
59288,Door. Chair. It's about Phillip.,dwight
59290,"I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.",dwight
59292,"Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, let's face it, is a big step up from living in a gay man's closet.",dwight
59294,Very well.,dwight
59296,Yes.,dwight
59297,What is this?,pam
59298,"Well I've been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldn't believe me, so [shows her DVD] I needed a little help.",jim
59299,Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.,dwight
59300,"OK, I don't have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.",jim
59301,[throws 'now' beanbag at Jim] Now.,dwight
59302,"I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip.",jim

59304,Go ahead.,pam
59305,"Ok, um, this is' [leaves DVD with her]'I'll be right back.",jim
59306,What do we got?,jim
59307,I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.,dwight
59308,"Wow! Congratulations, that's a really big step.",jim
59309,"She's got a ton of great qualities. She's young, she's beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because we're third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isn't technically incest.",dwight
59310,Right in the sweet spot. I think you're gonna be really happy.,jim
59311,"Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.",dwight
59312,[whistles] That's a lot of pros.,jim
59313,"And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.",dwight
59314,So what is the problem?,jim
59315,Angela.,dwight
59316,"I don't know what you want me to tell you, man. All I know is that every time I've been faced with a tough decision, there's only one thing that outweighs every other concern. One thing that will make you give up on everything you thought you knew, every instinct, every rational calculation.",jim
59317,Some sort of virus?,dwight
59318,Love.,jim
59319,Oh.,dwight
59320,"Dwight, listen: no matter what happens, you gotta forget about all the other stuff. You gotta forget about logic and fear and doubt. You just gotta do everything you can to get to the one woman who's gonna make all this worth it. At the end of the day, you gotta jump. You love Angela, Dwight. I think you always have.",jim
59321,"You're a good assistant, Jim.",dwight
59322,Not as good as you.,jim
59323,That's very true. Get the hell outta here.,dwight
59324,You got it.,jim
59325,You watched it.,jim
59326,Yeah.,pam
59327,"Well, then I guess you're ready for this. [gives her the Christmas card]",jim
59328,What's that?,pam
59329,It's from the teapot. Everything you'll ever need to know is in that note. [Pam reads the card] Not enough for me? You are everything.,jim

59364,What? Why would you say that',dwight
59366,[excited] Get out! I'm a dad!,dwight
59377,One more for the doc. [the office staff cheers],andy
59381,"Oh. Eh, whatever. No big deal.",andy
59387,Here we go. [documentary starts with the first scene of 'Pilot'],jim
59388,The documentary series finished airing ages ago. Why is PBS sending another crew?,dwight
59390,"pff, Nobody buys DVDs anymore.",dwight
59392,PBS. The propaganda wing of Bill and Melinda Gates and viewers like you.,dwight
59393,"In the past year, I have consolidated the entire Scranton paper market. We regained the white pages, the school district, Lackawanna county. We supply them all. I'm getting married tomorrow afternoon, and in the morning, there's a mini-reunion. A kind of a 'where are they now' panel at a local theatre. It'll be nice to see everyone again. [laughs] I haven't seen Kevin since we let him go.",dwight
59394,"[mimicking trumpet] Today marks several important milestones. Stanley, as you know, is retiring.",dwight

59402,Uh-huh.,dwight
59404,"It's a colloquial way of saying 'you're fired,' Kevin, which you are.",dwight
59405,"What? Dwight, you can't do that.",pam
59406,The cake has spoken Pam. Sorry.,dwight
59408,Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying.,dwight
59410,Based'on his merit.,dwight
59412,Umm'.,jim
59414,"Well, Toby will stop it. Anytime anyone's ever been fired, Toby's blocked it, so'",pam
59416,"Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Here's your cake.  [squirts frosting on the top] Bye, bye Toby.",dwight
59418,"I bike to work now. Saves on gas, cheaper than a vasectomy and, uh, oh, yeah, it's good for the environment too.",jim
59419,Pam and I are great. She just recently finished her mural for the Irish cultural center.,jim
59421,[to Cici] Can you clap! Can you clap for mom?,jim
59422,And Dwight is imitating Japanese business practices for reasons he explained to us in Japanese.,jim
59423,"[whispering] Angela, are you ready for the wedding?",pam
59425,"I think she looks good. Now that she's wearing sports bras, we don't see her boobs as much.",pam
59426,That is all. Have a good morning.,dwight
59428,[after Angela kisses Dwight] What was that for?,dwight
59430,Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.,dwight
59432,"Oh, and the old man to feed us the cheese that he's been fermenting since the day of my birth.  You keep forgetting about him.",dwight
59434,"I brought in some new faces, and one old. I always like Devon. I hired him back after Creed faked his own death in the baler the day after the doc aired. The only person he fooled was Kevin. Then the police showed up. Turns out, Creed was in the band 'The Grass Roots' in the 1960's. During that time, the police say he sold drugs and trafficked in endangered species meat and stole weapons-grade LSD from the military.",dwight
59441,"Okay, the limo's gonna be here at five.  I need everybody to be ready 'cause I want to pack in a lot.",jim
59443,"Uh, no. No whorehouse. This is Dwight's night, okay?",jim
59445,Dwight has made me his bestisch mensch. Which is Schrute for best man. He's putting himself entirely in my hands tonight. And I know for over 12 years I've done nothing but trick and prank him but tonight'only good surprises. 'Guten Pranken'. [chuckles],jim
59446,"Oh hey, Jim. I forgot to mention. Oftentimes, in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties, there are accidental murders. That won't be necessary tonight.",dwight
59448,"Okay, hold on. Are you sure Mose isn't going to show up?",jim
59449,"Ever since Angela moved in and Mose had to stop sleeping at the foot of my bed, he's been acting pretty weird about this whole wedding thing.",dwight
59450,Mose has been weird? That's so unlike him.,jim
59451,"Yeah, sure, I'll talk about it. Why not? American's next A Cappella Sensation aired my audition. And when I started sobbing uncontrollably, apparently that struck a chord with quite a lot of people. Not a very compassionate chord. The clip went viral, as they say",andy
59453,"Oh, I can so just sit here and cry!",andy
59454,Two million hits in the first week and then the parodies started. One from the Philippines got 12 million hits. And the late night comedy guys had a field day with it.,andy

59501,Surprise!,andy
59502,I thought you guys couldn't come.,dwight
59504,"Kismet? Yeah, right. Pam and I came up with excuses for every other weekend. You remember my two lap band surgeries, right? Neither do I? 'Guten Prank' number one.",jim

59528,"No, Dwight. You'll be doing the whacking.",jim
59529,A bazooka. You remembered.,dwight

59542,"Hey, dude, leave him alone. What are you doing?",jim
59543,"Jim, it's fine. He'll just get you on his cell phone and then that'll go viral.",andy
59545,"Yeah, I guess. But things are going well actually. I spoke at Cornell during commencement week. I mean, the seniors invited me as a joke but it was a huge success.",andy
59547,That's how I got my new job in the admissions office.,andy
59549,No. It's a job. Things are going great.,andy
59551,Yes.,andy
59560,"[sighs] Man, how long have we been sitting here?",dwight
59564,"Oh, Thank God. We are famished!",dwight
59567,"No, we haven't ordered anything. No one's even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?  [music plays and stripper starts dancing on Dwight]",dwight
59569,"Oh, we do. So we'll have an onion loaf for the table, please. And tell us about your heartiest soups.",dwight
59571,"Yes, an onion loaf for the table but that's not all. Now the chef special sounded good. What is it exactly?",dwight
59573,"Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chef's special? Tastes like cigarettes. That won't work. That's no good.",dwight
59576,"Oh, boy.",pam
59583,"Wait, wait. What?",pam
59586,"Uh, that seems inappropriate.",pam
59592,"Whoo-hoo'go, Meredith's stripper son.",pam
59600,"Now, for the last time, I'd like a side salad with balsamic.",dwight
59602,You're telling me!,dwight
59604,"What for? We haven't even gotten bread yet. Does anyone wanna split a twice baked potato? [to the dancing stripper] Do you have those? Those aren't deep fried, right?",dwight
59613,"Oh, man, never thought I'd say this but I think I ate too much bone marrow. [phone rings]",dwight
59614,"Oh, it's the girls. Hey Pam. What? Angela's been kidnapped! Phyllis left the door open and some freak came and grabbed her and fled.",jim
59615,Good old Mose. [laughing],dwight
59616,They think it was Mose.,jim
59617,"Oh, great. He's getting into the spirit of the festivities. Fantastic. He just pulled off a Braut Entfuhrung.",dwight
59619,"A ceremonial bridal kidnapping. He will take the bride and hide her at a local pub and when I find the place, I have to buy everyone drinks. Ah, all right! Oh Mose.",dwight
59620,Wait a minute. You said the tradition is for the groom is search for her and it ends at a pub. So how about the last pub you'd ever set foot in in this town?,jim
59621,Right. Which one is that?,dwight
59622,"Mm, hey driver. Why don't you take us to 3030 Adams?",jim
59623,Is that Mose?,jim
59624,"Yes, it is! I am here for my bride!",dwight
59627,Very well! Drinks on me! Bartender!  [Kevin turns around] Oh.,dwight
59629,"I heard you bought a bar, Kevin.",dwight
59631,[to Mose] Why did you pick this place? [Mose points to Jim],dwight
59632,Ooh.,jim
59633,You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch.,dwight
59634,"Nope, not a prank. I think it's time for you to bury the hatchet.",jim
59635,Waste of a good hatchet.,dwight
59636,"Okay, just talk.",jim
59638,I heard you say 'well' the first time.,dwight
59639,I know Dwight misses Kevin. I saw him make his portrait out of a Wooly Willy. Tomorrow's his wedding day. You can't be anything but happy on your wedding day.,jim
59640,It was nothing personal. It's just that you were terrible at your job.,dwight
59642,"No really. You were terrible at math and organization, time management, personal hygiene. Your internet searches were so filthy we had to throw our your computer.",dwight
59644,That's it.,dwight
59646,I missed you Kevin.,dwight
59648,Ohh.,dwight
59650,"Yes, Mose. Guten Prank number three.",jim
59651,You've had your drink. Now where is my bride?,dwight
59652,"Mose! What..ooh, Mose. [Mose opens trunk]",dwight
59654,"Hey. Hey, is Angela coming or'",jim
59655,No. We can't see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk.,dwight
59656,Right.,jim
59662,Am I the only one that's nervous? How are you doing with this? Should we have bailed?,jim
59663,"No, no, I'm fine.",pam
59664,Doesn't seem like anyone cares about us anyway.,jim
59666,I'm sorry guys. This is probably on me. I got hated on pretty hard when that auto-tune went viral.,andy
59669,I'll go talk to the manager. Maybe we should just go home. [walks down the hall],andy
59672,Ree-De-De-De-Doo!,andy
59675,With today's modern surveillance technology we are in a constant state of being watched weather it's our government or the government of other countries a.k.a. Google. You guys are being filmed way more than we ever were.,dwight
59678,"Well, I mean, How do you pay back someone for something like that? But, uh, I don't know. I'm working on something.",pam
59679,She pays me back every day just by being my wife so that's fine.,jim
59681,O-Kay.,jim
59683,[pause] I'm sorry. Is there a question?,pam
59686,"Oh, um, well, you know, I' I just' I just think I would rather keep that private. You know, if you'd been filmed for nine years of your life, there'd be some things that you just wanna keep to yourself.",pam
59694,"Um, you know what, I actually didn't handle that move, uh, very gracefully. From not communicating to being a little selfish.",jim
59695,"Listen, um' I was scared, you know? I loved what I had, and I didn't want to risk it. And I think that maybe I did doubt him a little too. Which was wrong because he's shown me time and again. But when the documentary started airing, people on the street told me that I had this fairy-tale romance. But there were a lot of times last year where it did not feel like a fairy tale. But then it got deeper, and it got stronger and now it's better than a fairy tale. It's like a long book that you never want to end.  And you're fine with that because you just never, ever wanna leave it.",pam
59697,"Yeah, like Harry Potter.",pam
59734,"Oh, boy. Maybe your heels are too high.",pam
59737,You ready?,jim
59738,[chuckles] You kidding? I was born ready. [mimicking heavy metal guitars],dwight
59739,"Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Um' I don't know how to tell you this, but' we have a little bit of a problem.",jim
59740,"Oh, no. What?",dwight
59741,The minister just told me that it's tradition for the Bestish Mensch to be older than the groom.,jim
59742,"Oh, come on. I've never heard of such a thing.",dwight
59743,"I haven't heard of it, obviously. But I'm out because I am significantly younger than you-",jim
59744,Not' significant is a big word',dwight
59745,"I think it's definitely' Well, okay. Either way'",jim
59746,I think you're only a teeny',dwight
59747,"Either way, Dwight' I can't be there for you. I'm sorry.",jim
59748,Jim.,dwight
59749,I just'really wish there was something I could do. [looks off],jim
59750,[turns around] [whispering] Michael. I can't believe you came.,dwight
59751,That's what she said.,michael
59752,Best prank ever.,jim
59759,"Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. They'll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab 'em on in there.",dwight
59760,Everybody!,dwight
59761,"[dancing with Pam. They kiss] See, now you don't owe me anything.",jim
59773,Michael has so many pictures of his kids he had to get two phones with two numbers and he pays two bills.,pam
59774,"[with Michael] Oh, my gosh, it's choreographed!",pam
59775,He just so happy to have a family plan.,pam
59779,Is it me? Is it Nellie?,pam
59798,[crying] I feel like all my kids grew up and then they married each other. It's every parent's dream.,michael
59800,Good night.,dwight
59803,Good evening.,dwight
59807,"It's only 6:00. Come on, everybody's going.",andy
59813,I need to get out of this dress.,pam
59814,I gotta get out of this dress.,jim
59816,What's going on?,jim
59817,[sighs] [whispering] Why are you still here?,pam
59819,"No, really, what's going on?",jim
59820,"Okay, Okay. Um' so' this past year has been really great, and you've been great and I just' I know that you had to make this choice and you had to give something up for me. But I never want you to have to give up anything. I just thought if I could get us an offer then there wouldn't be anything standing in our way and I could come to you with this big Jim gesture' and show you all at once just how much I love you and how much I really do believe in your future.",pam
59821,"Sorry, how long have you been showing the house?",jim
59822,About 2 months,pam
59823,That's why it's so clean.,jim
59824,Yeah.,pam
59825,"I mean, you were gonna do this without me?",jim
59826,"Well, you' you bought the house without telling me, so I thought I could sell it without telling you.",pam
59827,Oh' okay. Where would we go?,jim
59828,Austin? Maybe.,pam
59829,"I promise you, you don't have to do this for me.",jim
59830,I'm doing it for us.,pam
59831,The last',jim
59833,[to the buyer] Hold on a second. [to Pam] The last few months have meant the world to me and all I care about',jim
59834,"Hold on a second. [turning] Wait, what did you just say?",pam
59836,You wanna do this?,jim
59837,I wanna do this.,pam
59838,You really want to do this?,jim
59839,I really want to do this!,pam
59840,[hugging Pam] [laughing] Oh my God!,jim
59841,"Hey, Darryl. [whispers in his ear]",jim
59843,We're so excited.,pam
59849,"Uh, could I please have your attention? So a year ago, I got my first art commission to paint a mural for Dunder Mifflin and I decided to paint the history of paper',which was just some trees and stuff. And then someone spray painted a bunch of butts on it and I had to start from the beginning. But it all worked out for the best because I think that I've painted the perfect thing which is the history of us. All of us. And this is for you Jim. [applause] And go ahead! [drape drops and everyone cheers]",pam
59850,"Everyone, Let's take our picture in front of the mural. Oh, um, I just'I kind of meant just everybody from the office.",pam
59852,[whispering to Pam] Let's go outside,jim
59853,Okay.,pam
59858,"[answering the phone] Dunder Mifflin, This is Pam. Oh, I'm sorry. Jim Halpert doesn't work here anymore.",pam
59859,"I didn't watch the whole documentary. After a few episodes, it was too painful. I kept wanting to scream at Pam. It took me so long to do so many important things. It's just hard to accept that I spent so many years being less happy than I could have been. Jim was 5 feet from my desk and it took me four years to get to him. It'd be great if people saw this documentary and learned from my mistakes. Not that I'm a tragic person. I'm really happy now. But'it would just'just make my heart soar if someone out there saw this and she said to herself 'be strong, trust yourself, love yourself. Conquer your fears. Just go after what you want and act fast, because life just isn't that long.'",pam
59861,Hey guys.,dwight
59864,What about the honeymoon?,pam
59866,"Aww, J, P and D. The Three Amigos. Ah, it warms my heart. Hey, what do you say, when I get back from out honeymoon, the three of us have a conference room meeting just for fun? [pause] What is that meaningful look?",dwight
59867,You know what? Maybe we should talk.,jim
59870,[on the computer] You're probably sitting there wondering what will be your mark. What will you be known for? It might surprise you to learn...,andy
59871,I finally feel ready. Athlead is growing',pam
59872,Athleap.,jim
59873,And Jim can jump back in without skipping a beat. We'll come back to visit. But I think it's time for us to officially',pam
59874,"No, don't say it. You're fired! You're both fired!",dwight
59875,"Dwight, come on. Don't end on a bad note.",jim
59876,Don't be an idiot. It's for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year you've been here. That's the max.,dwight
59877,Thanks Dwight.,pam
59878,"Hey, and if you're ever in Austin...",jim
59879,"Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if you're ever in the area, you'll always have a place to stay'in my barn.",dwight
59880,There it is.,jim
59881,"Do I get along with my co-workers? Well, first of all, I don't have co-workers anymore, I have subordinates. So' have I gotten along with my subordinates? Let's see. My supplier relations rep, Meredith Palmer, is the only person I know who knows how to properly head bang to Motorhead. Oscar Martinez, my accountant, is now godfather to my son. Angela Schrute, my former accountant is now my wife. My top salesman, Jim Halpert was best man at my wedding and office administrator Pamela Beesley Halpert is my best friend. So'yes. I'd say I have gotten along with my subordinates.",dwight
59882,"[on computer] You might feel sorry for me but I actually feel sorry for you. Because you're about to leave Cornell. So say it with me: [all]: Oh, I can so just sit here and cry.",andy
59885,Thanks Dad'Darryl.,andy
59886,"I spent so much of my time here at Dunder Mifflin thinking about my old pals, my college a cappella group. The weird thing is now, I'm exactly where I wanna be. I got my dream job at Cornell and I'm still just thinking about my old pals. Only now they're the ones I made here. I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them. [pause] Someone should write a song about that.",andy
59890,"Imagine going back and watching a tape of your life. You could see yourself change and make mistakes'and grow up. You could watch yourself fall in love, watch yourself become a husband, become a father. You guys gave that to me. And that's'an amazing gift.",jim
59892,Thanks Phyl.,jim
59908,"I sold paper at this company for 12 years. My job was to speak to clients on the phone about quantities and types of copier paper. Even if I didn't love every minute of it, everything I have, I owe to this job. This stupid'wonderful'boring'amazing job.",jim
59909,I thought it was weird when you picked us to make a documentary. But all in all'I think an ordinary paper company like Dunder Mifflin was a great subject for a documentary. There's a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn't that kind of the point?,pam
